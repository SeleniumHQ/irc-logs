[00:39:46] jimevans: barancev|2 the IE driver does no checking to see if an element is in a form when submit is called. it looks to see if the element is an <input type="submit"> or <input type="image"> and if so, clicks on the element (usually using native events). if the element isn't one of those, it calls the submit atom.

[11:14:14] rlucke: is there somekind of API, somewhere i can see getters
[11:14:19] Tarun: which selenium tool are you using rlucke? I am not yet sure of your question

[11:16:17] Tarun: @rlucke let me check on that
[11:19:49] Tarun: @rlucke, I am not a selenium IDE user but this is what I found - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/collections/samit-badle/samits-selenium-ide-plugins/ hope you get some thing useful

[14:17:35] lucky_ has joined #selenium
[14:18:13] barancev|2: >>> the elements returned from findElements arent guaranteed to be in a order <<< -- are you sure? which locators does not guarrantee the order?

[14:18:46] llaskin: i've never seen them "out of order"
[14:19:23] AutomatedTester: barancev|2: we never guarantee order
[14:19:30] AutomatedTester: if they come back in order then awesome
[14:19:39] AutomatedTester: but if they go out of order then it wont be fixed
[14:19:43] barancev|2: "we" as mozilla firefox?
[14:19:49] AutomatedTester: we as in Selenium
[14:20:02] barancev|2: selenium just delegares down to the browser
[14:20:08] barancev|2: *delegates
[14:20:21] cgoldberg has joined #selenium
[14:20:23] AutomatedTester: yea and the browsers can return any order they want
[14:20:37] *AutomatedTester feels like he is missing something from this argument
[14:22:13] barancev|2: at least XPath 2.0 demands a query result be in the document order
[14:22:22] barancev|2: (the standard, I mean)
[14:22:36] qaguy has joined #selenium
[14:23:06] barancev|2: let me look at CSS standard...
[14:24:01] AutomatedTester: :spec
[14:24:01] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[14:25:03] barancev|2: CSS Level1: "The querySelectorAll() methods on the Document, DocumentFragment, and Element interfaces must return a NodeList containing all of the matching Element nodes within the subtrees of the context node, in document order. "
[14:25:49] barancev|2: so either some browsers break standards, or findElements returns elements in document order
[14:26:03] *AutomatedTester suspects the former
[14:27:27] barancev|2: I doubt so
[14:28:14] AutomatedTester: fair enough
[14:28:23] barancev|2: btw, what do we mean by "first" in "findElement returns the first elemend found by the givel locator" ?
[14:28:45] AutomatedTester: the first element in an array
[14:28:57] AutomatedTester: sorry
[14:29:06] AutomatedTester: its the first element in the tree that is tree
[14:29:06] barancev|2: he-he, this meand nothing :)
[14:29:14] AutomatedTester: found
[14:29:19] AutomatedTester: its the first element in the tree that is found

[14:29:44] selbot2: ok!
[14:29:48] barancev|2: first in the tree, right, that means that findElements should return them in order :)

[20:13:30] *lukeis has noticed the usage of german plurals lately, is that a thing?
[20:13:49] AutomatedTester: llaskin1: my gut feel is that the event listener isnt attached when you try use it
[20:13:50] simonstewart: It's been a long time since I worked somewhere that doesn't invest in infrastructure
[20:14:09] barancev: are we going to include implicit waits to the :spec ?

[20:26:36] itsmikerudolph has joined #selenium
[20:27:08] itsmikerudolph: is it a bad idea to create "helper" methods for web-driver tests? Could this lead to random stale element errors?
[20:27:52] llaskin1: itsmikerudolph: ...it could
[20:27:59] llaskin1: but unless you srew up, it shoudln't
[20:27:59] Dude-X: itsmikerudolph: stale element errors are usually due to not waiting properly
[20:29:38] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[20:29:58] itsmikerudolph: I have some tests that involve multiple navigation changes (for testing forward/back buttons) etc.. and I get stale element errors sometimes and other random errors. So it could be traced back to poor waits?
[20:30:44] KaibutsuX: if you're changing urls, all your elements become stale
[20:31:51] itsmikerudolph: well I call on them once the url has changed. Which should find them again through a wait.
[20:33:40] itsmikerudolph: My waits are on average about 15 seconds, that should be more than enough time to find an element right?
[20:34:32] barancev: "staleness" means that an element disappears
[20:34:47] barancev: no matter how long did you wait for the element to appear :)
[20:35:30] AutomatedTester: llaskin1: I cant think of a good way to solve this for you
[20:35:32] itsmikerudolph: But when I watch the test.. (I use SauceLabs) the video shows me that the element is on the page and visible

[20:39:37] barancev: on the other hand, you can see something that looks exactly like the element you want, but if selenium said it is stalled then it is stalled, and you see some other element

[21:52:52] ShawnM: i think it does support native events in ff18
[21:52:56] ShawnM: for windows firefox
[21:53:03] ShawnM: and ubuntu ff
[21:53:20] simonstewart: Good question, barancev, and one I will think about tomorrow.
[21:53:22] simonstewart: G'night all!

[21:57:18] ShawnM: are both local and CI using the same webdriver implementation? like language and stuff?
[21:57:38] ShawnM: for our ci we use sel grid which is java but locally we use the ruby webdriver

[22:00:40] ShawnM: we have this sort of situation commonly a variance in test results locally and remotely on CI boxes because of a variety of factors. Sometimes we resort to explicity doing the execute_script(select.click) stuff

[22:13:05] llaskin1: woops something else then what I thought it was
[22:13:06] llaskin1: hah
[22:25:23] Dude-X__: well mozilla is rewriting the browser using rust in the Servo project with collaboration of Samsung

[22:43:33] Revery: who uses opera now? is there some mobile platform where it's the default?

[23:07:50] andreastt: jarib: We're tied to what Chrome does.
[23:08:09] andreastt: Revery: 300m+ mobile users.
[23:10:09] Revery: yea it does seem to have a ton of mobile users, but most places i look say what it's available for but not what it's the default browser for, i know it exists for android for instance but I've never used it
[23:11:06] andreastt: I don't think anyone has the full overview, but primarily on OEMs in Latin America, and on feature phones I believe.
[23:11:22] Revery: andreastt: ah cool ty

[23:35:16] ShawnM: any thoughts on selenium being able to take ENV variables and perhaps explicitly being able to define which display for a browser to attach to for streamlining headless multi display setups?
[23:35:46] ShawnM: so that 1 sel node could handle unique displays per browser
[23:37:46] ShawnM: i mean the same result can be meet with multi binaries for firefox or by declaring a unique node with a display attached but i wasn't able to find a way for a single node with 1 browser binary to attach to unique xvfb displays
[23:39:19] llaskin: ShawnM:  selenium doesn't define that tho
[23:39:22] llaskin: use jenkins and it can do that
[23:39:28] llaskin: take a look at the XVnc plugin for jenkins
[23:39:46] ShawnM: yeah we dind't use any plugins for it just sort of hand implemented it
[23:41:02] llaskin: selenium doesn't have anything to do with ENV variables...
[23:41:06] llaskin: selenium only cares about your dom
[23:41:20] llaskin: its your code that can do the display ports ,etc
[23:42:27] ShawnM: well selenium is aware of how to launch a browser because of caps containing platform and binary location by default of overriden by a custom binary i was thinking if you could pass something to allow it to tell the OS which display to attach, just  a thought

[23:42:55] ShawnM: perhaps that webdriver code stuff though
[23:43:47] Dude-X__: ShawnM: it's better to work with a configuration file
[23:43:48] ShawnM: i guess people using CI already have plugins to handle most of this though, we just elected to not use those
[23:44:02] ShawnM: we do use like the nodeConfig.json
[23:44:18] Dude-X__: and have your test runner also have the ability to read ENV files to override settings that are in the config file
[23:44:30] Dude-X__: that has been successful at a former job
