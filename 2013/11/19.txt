[2013-11-19 01:56:27] ddary: simonstewart: the approach you wrote is fine for me
[2013-11-19 01:56:42] simonstewart: That's how I thought we'd be handling things
[2013-11-19 01:56:54] simonstewart: Was a little surprised to see that he'd signed the CLA himself
[2013-11-19 01:57:01] simonstewart: Oh well. The intention is good
[2013-11-19 01:57:06] ddary: yeah
[2013-11-19 01:57:21] simonstewart: And I'm updating our internal documentation to help clear things up
[2013-11-19 01:57:27] ddary: how many people are curently working with the tool?
[2013-11-19 01:57:41] simonstewart: Good question.
[2013-11-19 01:57:54] simonstewart: On my time, there are three of us, plus another two working really closely
[2013-11-19 01:58:06] simonstewart: But that excludes people on the feature teams
[2013-11-19 01:58:22] ddary: wow
[2013-11-19 01:58:29] simonstewart: It's not just selendroid
[2013-11-19 01:58:40] simonstewart: There's other bits of infrastructure that we're also piling in on
[2013-11-19 01:58:44] simonstewart: (such as buck)
[2013-11-19 01:59:21] ddary: btw thanks for mentioning the tool in your talk at mobile @scale
[2013-11-19 01:59:30] simonstewart: It's a pleasure

[2013-11-19 01:59:39] ddary: :-)
[2013-11-19 01:59:43] simonstewart: I've been reading through the source of Espresso too
[2013-11-19 01:59:53] simonstewart: Just writing up some comparisons
[2013-11-19 02:00:30] ddary: have you seen something that can be improved in selendroid based on the code you have seen in expresso?
[2013-11-19 02:00:44] simonstewart: Yup :)
[2013-11-19 02:00:58] simonstewart: I'm breaking out some action items that it'd be nice to address
[2013-11-19 02:01:05] simonstewart: Once I'm done, I'll bounce you a copy of the text
[2013-11-19 02:01:08] simonstewart: It's not that long
[2013-11-19 02:01:22] ddary: sounds good, thanks

[2013-11-19 02:21:51] simonstewart: Cos that's my other task of the day
[2013-11-19 02:22:10] ddary: it is working on emulators, yes
[2013-11-19 02:22:21] simonstewart: The unlocking?
[2013-11-19 02:22:28] simonstewart: Ohhh… what's the method?
[2013-11-19 02:22:33] ddary: if you have a hardware device, it will not work

[2013-11-19 03:53:22] ato: Right
[2013-11-19 03:53:34] ato: Usually in the driver implementations it uses the mouse cursor's last known point.

[2013-11-19 06:40:06] lord1234: SOL
[2013-11-19 06:40:10] lord1234: but you can always write your tests in FF
[2013-11-19 06:40:13] lord1234: and modify them for use in IE

[2013-11-19 06:44:54] mganz: So it's really an extra step. I might just use JUNIT for now. But I do love what I've been reading about Selenium.
[2013-11-19 06:45:10] simonstewart: You can export your IDE tests and run them from the command line
[2013-11-19 06:45:34] simonstewart: ddary: what are your feelings on swallowing InterruptedException? Work of the devil, or just a good idea?

[2013-11-19 06:46:23] lord1234: so use the WD API

[2013-11-19 06:48:01] ddary: simonstewart: exactly: one thing we are using a long timeout is when we start the emulator, because that can take 3 or more minutes

[2013-11-19 08:47:47] Oscar1: yeah my idea was to use aero :p and segement the screen into 4 parts
[2013-11-19 08:47:50] dimacus: and oss that sucker
[2013-11-19 08:48:09] dimacus: that might also work… but isn't aero windows 8 only?

[2013-11-19 09:11:55] lukeis: jleyba: so my issue is that the app takes 'a little while' before it loads the webview, seems like chromedriver is timing out before it is loaded and can find the process (i launch the app manually and see in adb shell ps that :auth process exists, but it does take a little bit to start ~ on an emulator of course)

[2013-11-19 09:28:43] dimacus: barancev:  is it very resource heavy btw?

[2013-11-19 09:37:07] dimacus: Oscar1:  barancev: ok next crazy idea… what we tap into the getScreenshot() method in WD? basically you have an external service beside the actual test that makes HTTP requests against the WD instance and takes a screenshot every say 1 second… we save those to dir, and use ffmpeg to stich them into video… i wonder if that will be too expensive on the WD to do
[2013-11-19 09:37:23] sfbrian, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-19 09:37:53] barancev: why WD should do this?
[2013-11-19 09:38:18] dimacus: b/c you can get a screenshot of the web page no matter how many items are sitting on top of the browser
[2013-11-19 09:38:43] dimacus: this solves the issue of having a video for each test individual in case you have 3 tests running at the box at the same time

[2013-11-19 09:39:56] Oscar1: tis actually not that expensive we did something similar at expedia
[2013-11-19 09:40:16] barancev: 1) browser does painting DOM to a canvas very slow
[2013-11-19 09:40:19] Oscar1: at the end of the regression we made an animated gif of all the screen shots
[2013-11-19 09:40:47] Oscar1: we just took a screen shot after each step
[2013-11-19 09:41:11] Oscar1: and in the after hook made the animated gif
[2013-11-19 09:41:12] dimacus: barancev:  hmmm maybe not 1 second but after each step
[2013-11-19 09:41:25] barancev: 2) you need video to catch issues, and there are chances that webdriver is not responsible -- so you can't catch screenshot when you really need it
[2013-11-19 09:41:34] dimacus: yeah true
[2013-11-19 09:41:37] Oscar1: the only problem is after soooooo many screen shots who is going to look at them all
[2013-11-19 09:41:37] barancev: system level screencasting is much better
[2013-11-19 09:42:09] dimacus: i agree i just haven't figured out how to do multiple system level screencasts at the same time :(
[2013-11-19 09:42:24] dimacus: not on windows at least… so damn easy on linux it hurts

[2013-11-19 10:54:35] chp: i kno abt proxies
[2013-11-19 10:54:44] chp: but not in selenium, just regular old proxies
[2013-11-19 10:54:45] jleyba: have a test that uses {"proxy": {"proxyType": "pac", "proxyAutoconfigUrl": url}}
[2013-11-19 10:54:47] chp: got any questions?

[2013-11-19 10:55:06] chp: :D
[2013-11-19 10:55:20] jleyba: the IEDriver doesn't appear to modify the system settings to use the pac
[2013-11-19 10:56:34] jimevans: ProxyManager::SetGlobalProxySettings is where that happens.
[2013-11-19 10:57:01] jleyba: I'd look into that, but I don't have access to VS
[2013-11-19 10:57:07] jimevans: There is a branch in that method for autoconfig.
[2013-11-19 10:57:36] jimevans: It admittedly might not do everything required.

[2013-11-19 12:53:05] ctmeece: I'm having trouble getting juUnit to run my Selenium script.
[2013-11-19 12:53:17] ctmeece: I followed the instructions here: http://blazemeter.com/blog/jmeter-webdriver-sampler, and it works, but now I'm a bit lost
[2013-11-19 12:53:17] ctmeece: [2:51pm]
[2013-11-19 12:53:42] ctmeece: i recorded a script using selenium IDE, and i exported it as jUnit
[2013-11-19 12:53:55] ctmeece: now, how do i get this script into JUnit?
[2013-11-19 12:54:12] tilgovi, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-11-19 12:54:55] jarib: ctmeece: i think you're confusing junit and jmeter
[2013-11-19 12:55:26] ctmeece: hmm, yeah i guess I am
[2013-11-19 12:56:00] jarib: junit is a java library for writing tests, jmeter is a performance test tool (with a gui)
[2013-11-19 12:56:01] ctmeece: is there an easy conversion route to get selenium IDE to spit out something that I can use in the Jmeter Selenium integration?
[2013-11-19 12:56:58] ctmeece: JMeter supports wendrive, and I have a Selenium IDE script, so how to get the two together?

[2013-11-19 13:55:01] Dude-X: if you quit, you get no unpaid unvacation
[2013-11-19 13:55:04] Dude-X: err paid
[2013-11-19 13:55:18] Dude-X: err unused PTO
[2013-11-19 13:55:40] Dude-X: the general limit is one week
[2013-11-19 13:56:05] Dude-X: the general rule is for every day of PTO you want off, you have to give that many weeks of notice
[2013-11-19 13:56:21] Dude-X: so a 2 week vacation requires a 10 week advanced notice
[2013-11-19 13:57:11] Dude-X: also no gaming of the system based on the rules, to be on vacation as long as possible
[2013-11-19 13:57:28] Dude-X: but if you want to take a 1 month off for whatever reason you can if you get permission
[2013-11-19 13:57:46] Dude-X: and give sufficient notice and plan of stuff to do in your abscense
