[00:56:15] doktrin: when clicking on a web-element (say, 'a' tags), what's the recommended way to verify success? I'm running tests with the chrome driver, in Java, and the method has no return value (void)
[00:56:46] doktrin: based on what I saw earlier, the same holds true in Ruby (again, with chrome), although the firefox driver returns a status string (ruby)
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jan 23 01:04:53 2013]
[01:04:53] doktrin: I gather that the go-to method is to validate against some property of the target link (i.e. title text, etc.) - is there some reason HTTP status codes are not reported / used as well?

I have several IDE-Written HTML Tests which I whant my jenkins to run continuously. for testing purposes I whanted them to run on a vm first. so what I did was: I installed a vm running the latest standalone server of selenium.

[13:15:27] RossPatterson: Saw the Q last night, but didn't answer it because I don't know for certain.
[13:15:38] rmartin: I guess I can do that by passing parameters when starting the nodes.

[13:41:39] Phil37: most of my stack traces from last year also suggest this
[13:41:45] RossPatterson: But I believe there were some recent changes (2.28 maybe?) that improved the detection of elements that are hidden, particularly in Firefox.

[14:02:45] RossPatterson: Good luck.  Except for the things AutomatedTester was hinting at, I've found that all the places where WebDriver is more restrictive are places where RC shouldn't have allowed us to do something.  Like clicking a button that was hidden.

[14:15:01] millenium: * "or just for simulating user actions?"
[14:16:24] Guest49125 has joined #selenium
[14:17:41] RossPatterson: That depends on whether it matters to you if the elements exist or what position they are in.  At my job, we have tests that confirm that certain elements exist, but we don't do visual aspects (colors, layout, etc.)  We think humans do a better job  of that.
[14:18:11] millenium: I'm still not finding good technics for testing design and layots for some elements on the table I found one extension for Java which can make screenshot on specific WebElement and compare it with base one but just this
[14:18:26] RossPatterson: Our guiding principle is to use automation for things that must happen quickly or that are boring and repetitive.  "A [human] mind is a terrible thing to waste."

[14:50:16] millenium: ok I have one more philosophical question is it good aproach to test for example jQyeryUI/KendoUI with WebDriver for example Datepicker :?
[14:50:56] RossPatterson: Ooh ... date pickers are deep evil.
[14:51:17] p_l: ... aaaaaaaaa datepickers! Run for your lives!
[14:51:24] Phil37: esp dojo ones
[14:51:37] RossPatterson: Yeah, DOJO is the tool of the Devil.
[14:51:49] millenium: aha, try KendoUI
[14:52:13] RossPatterson: Yes, you probably need to test their use in your app, but I'd strongly advise you to assume that they do their job properly, and not try to test THEIR functionality yourself.
[14:52:37] ner0x has joined #selenium
[14:53:28] millenium: RossPatterson not always, for example: http://demos.kendoui.com/web/grid/index.html
[14:53:40] RossPatterson: We have some custom JavaScript UI components based on similar stuff, and we have strong unit tests for the components, using Selenium RC to run the tests.  After those pass, we just assume that the components function correctly.
[14:54:15] RossPatterson: Grids are almost as evil as date pickers.
[14:54:16] millenium: if the developer didn't set correct filters I think with WebDriver test for checking the filters have to detect the bug
[14:54:40] RossPatterson: Sure, but that's your app function, not the component function.
[14:55:32] millenium: RossPatterson exactly that's why I need to test it (automatically) and I try with selenium
[14:57:24] millenium: RossPatterson and what if our developers today didn't dring enought coffe and write some JS which mess up the UI framework and the grid can't be resized any more?
[14:58:08] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[14:59:35] RossPatterson: There's a line between the app and the environment it runs in.  One generally tests the former and not the latter.  The line may be thin or thick, it may have sharp or fuzzy edges, it may be closer to the app or to the OS kernel.  But it still exists.  You need to decide where and how to draw it.
[14:59:44] jimevans: open question. should IE behave as #5057 suggests? should it fail immediately upon finding a closed window?

[15:00:08] Ardesco: Somebody on the mailing list has just asked for a "credible source or site that says Selenium RC *will* be deprecated"
[15:00:12] *Ardesco facepalms
[15:00:24] jimevans: we throw the proper exception, but it just waits until the implicit wait timeout expires.
[15:00:34] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: link the blog
[15:00:42] RossPatterson: jimevans: He's using implicit waits.  IEDriver should wait for the human to manually re-open the window :-)
[15:01:11] RossPatterson: Ah, the issue doesn
[15:01:20] Ardesco: i linked seleniumhq.com
[15:01:23] RossPatterson: Ah. the issue didn't make that clear.
[15:01:48] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: is it on the site?
[15:01:52] AutomatedTester: I know its on the blog
[15:01:54] Ardesco: Selenium WebDriver is the successor of Selenium Remote Control which has been officially deprecated. The Selenium Server (used by both WebDriver and Remote Control) now also includes built-in grid capabilities.
[15:01:59] Ardesco: right on the front page
[15:02:14] AutomatedTester: who am I to argue :)

[15:14:47] simonstewart: (and, yes, I am pretty busy)
[15:15:02] AutomatedTester: be off with you then
[15:16:40] *simonstewart dons cloak of invisibility
[15:17:31] plightbo_work: simonstewart: there?
[15:17:41] jimevans: RossPatterson: agreed, but the question is, should we fail fast here? i'm thinking maybe we should.
[15:17:50] plightbo_work: simonstewart: can't see a timestamp of when you put on the cloak so not sure if you're still busy :)
[15:18:10] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: Gotta ask - why is the command "take>>>S<<<screenshot"?  That's the only command that sounds declarative (like an interface) rather than imperative (like a method).
[15:19:22] RossPatterson: jimevans: Agreed.  I didn't realize until your comment drove me to the logfile that it was honoring the implicit wait.  Still, how would you tell the difference between a window that has opened and closed and a window that hasn't yet opened?
[15:20:09] jimevans: RossPatterson: if the window hasn't opened yet, then the switchTo().window() would fail.
[15:20:21] jimevans: gotta switch context before the findElement.
[15:20:37] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: we have it as a method
[15:20:46] AutomatedTester: except in 16.2 and 16.3
[15:20:53] AutomatedTester: I think that needs updating
[15:21:03] AutomatedTester: actually, let me look at it closer
[15:23:07] AutomatedTester: actually... my brain isnt working
[15:23:11] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: what do you mean
[15:23:37] RossPatterson: jimevans: OK, but now we're discussing a race condition, right?  Two processes (IE and script), one does open-switchto-find, the other does close.  What's right depends on who wins?
[15:24:29] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: oh... I get what you mean
[15:24:33] AutomatedTester: sorry...
[15:24:44] *AutomatedTester needs more coffee
[15:24:51] jimevans: RossPatterson: no, the script does click-to-open-new-window > switchto > close > find-without-switching-back-to-original-window.
[15:25:06] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: honest answer, its probably because of the interface
[15:25:07] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: We have Capabilities called "takesScreenshot" and comands that (I think) should be called "takeScreenshot".
[15:25:28] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: and I agree
[15:25:58] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: lemme update that quickly
[15:26:16] *simonstewart decloaks briefly
[15:26:23] RossPatterson: jimevans: Never mind, I'm completely off base.
[15:26:39] simonstewart: I'd really rather we didn't go around renaming all our methods, particularly popular ones

[15:27:22] simonstewart: Unless there's a very good reason.
[15:27:42] simonstewart: Most of the commands are imperatives already: findElement! get!
[15:27:47] simonstewart: takeScreenshot! 
[15:27:50] RossPatterson: I understand, and that's what I thought the reason would be.  But if there's going to be a change to that command in the spec, now's the (only?) time to fix that.
[15:27:59] simonstewart: Agreed.
[15:28:13] RossPatterson: simonstewart: But it's "takesScreenshot", according to the spec.
[15:28:13] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the spec has takesScreenshot as the command
[15:28:18] AutomatedTester: not takeScreenshot
[15:28:30] AutomatedTester: and that is what I am correcting 
[15:29:03] simonstewart: Oh. Well that's probably a typo. Check with the implementations to be sure
[15:29:10] AutomatedTester: thats what I am doing too
[15:29:27] AutomatedTester: the implementation has screenshot

[15:33:39] barancev|2: jimevans: if the window is not here, there is no reason to wait, it'll never appear
[15:33:52] simonstewart: Pushed
[15:33:53] RossPatterson: (Although "Differences from the WebDriver JsonWireProtocol" might make a useful non-normative appendix.)
[15:34:04] simonstewart: RossPatterson: we don't intend any differences
[15:34:08] simonstewart: ATM
[15:34:10] RossPatterson: Good to know.
[15:34:20] RossPatterson: Now get back under that cloak :-)
[15:34:52] barancev: jimevans: is there a situation when findElement can succeed if in the beginning of wait the current window is not available?
[15:35:47] jimevans: i don't believe so. the question is, what dofirefox/chrome/other drivers do?

[18:45:50] barancev: I doubt he will be able to run selenium test in firefox on this computer because we have a restriction (hardcoded) to access connedtions from 127.0.0.1 only

[19:10:33] lukeis: depends on driver, but most can't
[19:10:59] lukeis: actually with the standard api, you can't :)
[19:11:22] tmrhmd: it would be great though, I just found out casper.js has that in it's API
[19:11:56] lukeis: yeah, i don't think that has a chance of making it into the api, mainly because it's unrealistic to implement in all the browsers

[19:49:58] lukeis: hiya simonstewart, did you need plightbo_work to do the redirect of the naked domain to docs? (I thought so, but just want to make sure)
[19:50:11] simonstewart: yes, I do
[19:50:24] simonstewart: Or rather, yes, I think I do
[19:50:32] lukeis: :)
[19:50:47] lukeis: what about updating www to point to appengine?
[19:51:48] AutomatedTester: oh hai simonstewart
[19:51:56] *lukeis needs to start working on appengine-fying the other sites
[19:52:04] simonstewart: Had to leave work early, so catching up on some stuff now
[19:52:18] simonstewart: lukeis: the main problem are the permanent redirects
[19:52:23] lukeis: yeah, i know
[19:52:30] simonstewart: But, yes, plightbo_work has The Power Of Redirect
[19:52:43] lukeis: but changing www to point to appengine should just be dns?
[19:52:50] lukeis: and appengine config
[19:53:14] lukeis: 'eventually' the permanent redirect will die? maybe? when everyone is on Windows 15?
[19:54:06] lukeis: naked -> docs is what is avoiding the circular redirect
[19:54:18] simonstewart: I believe we use a redirect from the http server hosted on that server.
[19:54:27] simonstewart: I can certainly set www to be a cname for docs
[19:54:27] lukeis: yes, on openqa
[19:54:45] lukeis: that's what I'd like… any appengine config needed though? (to use www)
[19:55:29] simonstewart: I have no idea :)
[19:55:36] lukeis: btw, this is the longest transition of a site from one hosted service to another that I've ever participated in ;)
[19:55:39] simonstewart: If there is, I can handle it
[19:55:44] simonstewart: ditto
[19:55:48] lukeis: did you do anything for 'docs' ?
[19:55:55] simonstewart: The DNS thing was a real spanner in the works, but it's done now
[19:56:05] simonstewart: Yeah. I had to register it in the appengine config

[20:00:08] AutomatedTester: right,  lets work on Marionette...
[20:00:44] RossPatterson: lukeis: "i don't like the spec and the json wire protocol diverging" --> simonstewart asserted earlier today that there aren't any intended differences, at least not yet.
[20:01:07] lukeis: well, webelement.screenshot is a divergance
[20:01:26] simonstewart: lukeis: it's only because no one has implemented it in the remote drivers
[20:01:33] lukeis: it's not in the wire protocol
[20:01:41] *lukeis knows it's not implemented
[20:01:45] AutomatedTester: and I suggested it could be
[20:01:52] AutomatedTester: in the W3 mailing list
[20:02:00] *lukeis isn't on the W3 list
[20:03:29] simonstewart: lukeis: it's not in the protocol because no-one's implemented it
[20:03:45] simonstewart: The JsonWireProtocol page represents the current state of play
[20:04:06] simonstewart: The W3C spec is that with planned future changes
[20:04:15] lukeis: :-/
[20:04:23] simonstewart: (eg: using named error codes instead of ints)
[20:04:39] jimevans: simonstewart: huh. i always went the other way with it, implementing it when it appeared on the wiki page.
[20:05:20] simonstewart: jleyba started writing it because he was fed up with things not being properly documented
[20:05:21] jimevans: (of course, the IE driver has never been "first to implement")
[20:05:22] lukeis: other than element.screenshot and named error codes, are these being tracked anywhere other than in people's head? :)
[20:05:46] simonstewart: Normally any changes are discussed on selenium-developers
[20:06:01] simonstewart: Screenshot was discussed ages ago
[20:06:19] lukeis: yeah, i must have just had a buffer flush of that in my head

[20:20:24] jimevans: lukeis: i was looking at the rss feed, and that's what made me ask the question :)
[20:20:34] lukeis: ah ;)
[20:20:53] lukeis: i personally ignore them… subconsciously makes me never want to revisit the issue
[20:22:05] jimevans: i mean, i try to look at it from the user's perspective. an issue gets reported, by them or someone else, and then it sits there with little-to-no action from the committers, and that's gotta be frustrating.
[20:22:43] jimevans: but at the same time, if i had an update to the issue, i'd post the update *to* the issue.
[20:23:27] jimevans: (i'm leaving aside the "fix it your-own-damned-self" argument, for the nonce)
[20:24:38] lukeis: the fun thing is with iOS, these bugs are extremely difficult to run down
[20:25:00] lukeis: but it'll end up being just some funny thing in javascript that is failing
[20:25:11] lukeis: i can guarantee that ;)
[20:25:57] jimevans: jleyba: how stable have you found the websocket communication channel in the safari driver thus far?
[20:26:17] jleyba: Never had a problem with it.
[20:26:41] farlan has joined #selenium
[20:26:46] jleyba: The only networking problems the SD has is on start-up.  Safari sometimes appears to hang on an initial DNS lookup, causing the client to time out
[20:26:51] jleyba: but that's well before the WebSocket is created
[20:26:58] jimevans: fair enough.
[20:27:33] qaguy has joined #selenium
[20:27:53] jleyba: The java client is coded to blow up if the websocket closes prematurely, but it should be easy to make it recover gracefully if connection is reestablished within some time frame
[20:28:37] RossPatterson: lukeis: [re: spec] I'm watching the spec development, and I'm planning an I'm-not-an-implementer-so-I-don't-know-squat cross-check between it and JsonWireProtocol.  My personal goal is to have a definitive (but in spec-language, "non-normative") list of differences.  Presumably there will be a desire here to bring WebDriver into compliance with the spec reasonably quickly.
[20:29:44] *RossPatterson wouldn't mind a JsonWireProtocol vs. IEDriver vs. FirefoxDriver vs. ChromeDriver vs. SafariDriver vs. HtmlUnitDriver vs. YoMamaDriver review either.
[20:30:09] lukeis: you left out a few ;)
[20:30:19] RossPatterson: Yo' mama :-)
[20:31:24] lukeis: i have 20 min till another 1.5 hours of meetings! joy! … lunch time :)
[20:33:05] AutomatedTester: RossPatterson: the Driver show down would actually be very good
[20:34:22] jimevans: jleyba: so is there enough here to create a safari driver CI build? do you know which tests in the java test suite need to be @ignore'd to produce a clean run?
[20:35:00] jleyba: ./go safari:test will run the java test suite using the prebuilt extension
[20:35:12] jleyba: Everything should pass
[20:35:20] jleyba: (or already be @ignored)
[20:35:22] jimevans: that's what i wanted to know. thanks.
[20:36:12] RossPatterson: AutomatedTester: Yeah, I'm thinking of that anyway.
[20:36:59] RossPatterson: But I suspect (actually, hope) it would become obsolete quickly.

[22:32:00] dokma: how do I get the coordinates for clickatandwait???
[22:32:26] jimevans: okay, they don't provide any way to manage the IEDriverServer.exe. that's a mistake.
[22:32:46] lukeis: there's more than one mistake
[22:32:49] lukeis: ;)
[22:33:04] jimevans: didn't say it was the only one, only that it was *a* mistake. :)
[22:33:38] AutomatedTester: THE WHOLE THING MAKES ME ANGRY
[22:33:42] AutomatedTester: WHY ARE WE SHOUTING
[22:34:08] *lukeis <3's libraries that really don't add value and actually take away value by not being able to easily access newer/better features in future releases
[22:35:02] sayd: AutomatedTester: oops 
[22:35:28] dokma: anyone??? how do you guys get coordinates for clickAt???
[22:35:33] AutomatedTester: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pdWAcK6Eh8
[22:35:49] jimevans: don't make AutomatedTester angry. you wouldn't like him when he's angry.
[22:35:53] AutomatedTester: dokma: what does the docs in IDE suggest?
[22:35:54] sayd: AutomatedTester: what is your code?
[22:36:04] sayd: the python bindings?
[22:36:08] AutomatedTester: sayd: the official python bindings
[22:36:42] dokma: AutomatedTester: nothing, that's the problem
[22:36:58] dokma: all I see it this: Arguments:      locator - an element locator     coordString - specifies the x,y position (i.e. - 10,20) of the mouse event relative to the element returned by the locator.  Clicks on a link, button, checkbox or radio button. If the click action causes a new page to load (like a link usually does), call waitForPageToLoad.
[22:37:19] AutomatedTester: dokma: so you specify the element
[22:37:33] AutomatedTester: and then pick a relative point to that
[22:37:48] AutomatedTester: you dont need to know the exact position when you pass it in
[22:37:51] dokma: the "and then pick a relative point to that" is the tricky part
[22:37:57] santiycr has joined #selenium
[22:38:04] AutomatedTester: why is that tricky?
[22:38:06] dokma: if it's about 200px down and 300px left and then a 5x5 region
[22:38:13] dokma: it's not that easy to guess
[22:38:15] sayd: cool, this will make you happy then https://github.com/sebuilder/se-builder/issues/16
[22:38:19] dokma: do you use some tool or what?
[22:39:12] AutomatedTester: dokma: tbh I would just use clickAndWait if I had to do a click
[22:39:20] sayd: AutomatedTester: ↑
[22:39:30] dokma: AutomatedTester: the problem is I don't have an element locator
[22:39:40] dokma: I need a general click on a page at a specific location
[22:39:51] AutomatedTester: dokma: huh?
[22:40:13] dokma: I need an equivalent of an "click the first post on the page"
[22:40:30] dokma: there's no id on the link since it changes every time
[22:40:33] AutomatedTester: use xpath/css to find the element
[22:41:00] Ardesco_H: dokma, to start you off try firepath for firebug for firefox
[22:41:10] sayd: im not sure how many users that selenium builder thing actually has. lukeis said its replacing the ide 
[22:41:10] AutomatedTester: sayd: wow... didnt realise se-builder was that behind
[22:42:31] sayd: yeah you'd think there'd be a test somewhere for that 
[22:45:23] detronizator: unfortunately I have to confirm: something broke in the "get_text" atom

[23:01:36] jleyba: jimevans: ^
[23:01:51] AutomatedTester: detronizator: um thats not get_text()
[23:01:56] AutomatedTester: thats isShown
[23:02:02] jimevans: jleyba: we've tried finding an element. it's the java process that hangs. the browser is still responsive.
[23:02:13] detronizator: that's the tricky bit
[23:02:20] detronizator: I'm tracing down "getText"
[23:02:25] detronizator: and it uses "getVisibleText"
[23:02:31] detronizator: that arrives to that bit of code
[23:02:34] jleyba: jimevans: interesting, don't think I've ever seen that happenm
[23:02:46] detronizator: and if my guess is right, a "title" element has w/h 0/0
[23:02:47] AutomatedTester: detronizator: whats the error?
[23:02:48] jimevans: jleyba: you run on windows regularly?
[23:02:57] jimevans: (just checking, many people don't)
[23:03:05] detronizator: AutomatedTester: getText on a title returns an empty string
[23:03:17] jleyba: During development, hardly ever.
[23:03:18] detronizator: instead before was returning the title
[23:03:31] AutomatedTester: well... a title element isnt visible
[23:03:36] detronizator: -_-'
[23:03:37] jleyba: We do have the SD setup on our infrastructure here and it's used regularly
[23:03:55] detronizator: AutomatedTester: no, it is. just not strictly within the page
[23:04:04] jleyba: detronizator: it's been a while since getText returned the text of <title>
[23:04:16] jleyba: getText returns an empty string for any element belonging to <head>
[23:04:23] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I would consider it a bug if it returned the title
[23:04:47] detronizator: jleyba: mmm - when did that change?... well, now I know when it did change

[23:05:39] detronizator: that's what I'm about to do, as understadning the whole file will take me too long
[23:05:58] detronizator: but it would be interesting to understand more about what jleyba said
[23:06:09] AutomatedTester: detronizator: unless your title has -webkit-transform: attached to it it wont make any difference
[23:06:23] AutomatedTester: detronizator: <head> elements are not visible
[23:06:34] detronizator: it's the title in this test page http://localhost:2310/common/frameset.html
[23:06:37] detronizator: from the debug-server
[23:06:43] AutomatedTester: so getText on invisible elements returns ''
[23:06:50] detronizator: yes
[23:07:08] jimevans: jleyba: in the .NET tests, i'm seeing two large classes of failures. first is the cookie issue i mentioned earlier, second is that for the typing test, i'm seeing the wrong element get the focus so all of the typing tests fail.

[23:09:04] detronizator: AutomatedTester: just tried with Firefox, and a "getText" on the title tag returned the title text
[23:09:09] detronizator: just saying...
[23:09:21] AutomatedTester: how did you test it
[23:09:30] detronizator: same exact test, run against Firefox
[23:09:35] detronizator: how else?
[23:09:36] AutomatedTester: which test?
[23:09:56] detronizator: I'm about to throw code in here
[23:09:59] detronizator: WebDriver d = getDriver();
[23:09:59] detronizator:         String expectedTitle = "Unique title";

[23:10:00] detronizator:         assertEquals(expectedTitle, d.findElement(By.tagName("title")).getText());
[23:10:17] detronizator: localhost:2310 is the debug-server
[23:10:52] AutomatedTester: interesting
[23:11:48] AutomatedTester: that imho is a bug
[23:12:19] AutomatedTester: detronizator: but back to my change, unless your code has a transform on a title tag it wont make a difference
[23:12:39] AutomatedTester: and fwiw, putting a transform on a <title> is an interesting thing to do
[23:13:01] detronizator: AutomatedTester: no transform on title or stuff like that
[23:13:10] detronizator: just a plain <head><title>Unique title
[23:13:13] AutomatedTester: wait... sorry
[23:13:35] AutomatedTester: so that change is correct
[23:14:04] detronizator: well, whatever uses that atom will see a difference if used against Title
[23:14:30] AutomatedTester: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#GET_/session/:sessionId/title
[23:14:31] detronizator: anyway, I'm reverting your change locally to see if your change is correlated

[23:16:40] detronizator: but still, angry-mob-alert
[23:16:41] jimevans: AutomatedTester: not to inject myself into the discussion here, but am i to understand that getText on a <title> element should now return an empty string?
[23:16:53] AutomatedTester: jimevans: imho yes
[23:17:07] jimevans: AutomatedTester: please hold, caller.
[23:17:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: what is the visible text of a title?
[23:17:11] dokma: Is this a valid XPath for the first link that contains 'View to profile of' in the title??? //a[contains(title, 'View the profile of')][1]
[23:17:31] detronizator: AutomatedTester: personally, I beliee it's the title of the page that you DO SEE on the top of your browser window
[23:17:45] detronizator: so, strictly speaking, I see it
[23:17:57] detronizator: but I also see your point: I don't mind either way
[23:18:10] detronizator: I just think consequences might arise from such "subtle" change
[23:18:29] AutomatedTester: we can add another conditional for titles
[23:18:33] detronizator: and I say "might" because I still haven't confirmed it's the root cause of my issue (because building atoms takes time!)
