[09:21:53] selbot2_: simonstewart: note from krosenvold_ 2 days ago: "when" 
[09:22:10] simonstewart: krosenvold_: here now
[09:22:11] simonstewart: Let's chatr
[09:22:20] rodneyrehm has joined #selenium
[09:22:26] rodneyrehm: hey there
[09:22:33] simonstewart: Greetings
[09:22:44] krosenvold_: God morgen, simonstewart !
[09:22:52] rodneyrehm: I'm running into a problem using executeAsyncScript()
[09:22:53] simonstewart: Yo!
[09:23:05] rodneyrehm: for some reason I'm getting immediately timed out
[09:23:10] simonstewart: It looks like we have enough space to flip the git bit: Your project is using approximately 6278 MB out of 8192 MB total quota.
[09:23:24] simonstewart: That'll be because the timeout may be set to zeo
[09:23:26] simonstewart: zero
[09:23:28] rodneyrehm: the synchronous executeScript() works, but, well, isn't async
[09:23:33] krosenvold_: I think there's a misplaced comma, simonstewart 
[09:23:34] rodneyrehm: any idea what I could be missing?
[09:23:38] simonstewart: driver.manage().timeouts().somethingorrather
[09:23:51] krosenvold_: The git repo is 627 mb
[09:24:01] krosenvold_: give or take a few mb
[09:24:05] rodneyrehm: currentDriver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
[09:24:15] simonstewart: du -sm selenium-git-release-candidate/
[09:24:16] rodneyrehm: was what I had in there, simonstewart 
[09:24:16] simonstewart: 925	selenium-git-release-candidate/
[09:24:21] simonstewart: I get 925MB
[09:24:28] krosenvold_: you need to make a --bare clone to see the "server" size
[09:24:35] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ then you should have 5 seconds
[09:24:42] simonstewart: what's the difference?
[09:24:42] krosenvold_: or run du in the ".git" folder ;)
[09:24:49] krosenvold_: The checkout itself
[09:24:57] rodneyrehm: setScriptTimout()â€¦
[09:25:02] rodneyrehm: WARGH!
[09:25:04] simonstewart: 708MB for the .git folder alone
[09:25:11] *rodneyrehm is an idiot and needs to learn RTFM
[09:25:13] krosenvold_: Yes
[09:25:26] krosenvold_: And if I ran some agressive repacking I think it shrinkg 50 mb more
[09:25:38] nhirata has joined #selenium
[09:25:45] krosenvold_: That would be something google code does
[09:25:49] simonstewart: That's quite a bit bigger than the svn checkout
[09:25:49] krosenvold_: as a batch job of sorts
[09:25:58] simonstewart: You'd certainly hope so!
[09:26:17] krosenvold_: I'd assume the svn chekout is 925 - 708
[09:26:42] simonstewart: So, final question: do the benefits of switching git offset the larger initial checkout?
[09:26:44] krosenvold_: Since 708 is the full history, which consumes 6278 MB out of 8192 MB total quota. (accordin to you)
[09:26:48] simonstewart: Right
[09:26:53] krosenvold_: simonstewart: Obviously ;)
[09:27:00] simonstewart: I thought you'd say that
[09:27:30] krosenvold_: I have (almost) never been one of those mechanized "surrender to git" drones
[09:27:40] simonstewart: And I trust you
[09:27:49] simonstewart: But I have to ask the question :)
[09:28:02] simonstewart: Because I've never been one of those drones either.
[09:28:06] krosenvold_: There is the option of removing some mozilla sdks etc
[09:28:16] krosenvold_: It would probably save 1-200mb
[09:28:21] krosenvold_: BUt then we'd be losing history
[09:28:23] krosenvold_: I say fuck it
[09:28:30] simonstewart: I'd agree
[09:28:40] simonstewart: If people want a lighter checkout, they can just checkout HEAD
[09:29:03] krosenvold_: 'There is "sparse" checkouts if you're on a river boat in the amazon
[09:29:42] krosenvold_: But in that position I'd recommend checking out while you're still at the explorer club in London
[09:29:43] simonstewart: I thought the sparse ones copied the entire history and then only placed a small subset of the files on the disk
[09:29:58] simonstewart: Right. Pinged Daniel Wagner-Hall
[09:30:02] simonstewart: He should be online soon
[09:30:04] simonstewart: jarib: yt?
[09:30:25] krosenvold_: Does DWH need to do something =
[09:30:26] krosenvold_: ?
[09:30:50] simonstewart: If something goes wrong, he's the best person to get an immediate response from the Google Code chaps
[09:30:54] simonstewart: Because, you know, Google
[09:31:01] krosenvold_: ;)
[09:31:13] krosenvold_: What could go wrong, it's google ?
[09:31:32] krosenvold_: (Laughs out quietly)
[09:31:33] simonstewart: You weren't there when we did the initial push to google svn
[09:31:44] simonstewart: I was up for well over a day
[09:32:41] krosenvold_: Yup, wait for the cavalry to be around ;)
[09:32:57] simonstewart: (also doing a checkout of the existing svn tree)
[09:33:23] krosenvold_: I need to slurp the latest svn changes right before we flip
[09:33:43] krosenvold_: And maybe someone should ping the mailing list ?
[09:33:50] simonstewart: Was just writing it
[09:35:28] simonstewart: This is going to do interesting things to our version number
[09:35:36] simonstewart: Since we report the revision
[09:36:34] simonstewart: krosenvold_: How's the bandwidth for you? 
[09:36:41] simonstewart: Shall I do the push to the repo or you?
[09:37:03] simonstewart: Dan's just eating breakfast
[09:37:09] simonstewart: He'll be here around 10
[09:38:14] simonstewart: krosenvold_: any idea of a nice way of handling the sites?
[09:38:51] krosenvold_: simonstewart: I'm on 100mbit
[09:38:54] simonstewart: (svn/www)
[09:38:55] krosenvold_: Should be enough
[09:39:02] simonstewart: Then you should do the push
[09:39:06] krosenvold_: ok
[09:39:12] krosenvold_: How long till 10 ?
[09:39:18] simonstewart: 15 minutes
[09:39:30] simonstewart: You can have longer if you want it :)
[09:39:41] krosenvold_: Nope ;)

[09:42:33] krosenvold_: It's been about 3 years since I did any significant work on this server. Only thin troubling me was that I was running 32 bit linux
[09:42:46] simonstewart: Running lots of stuff needing the extra memory?
[09:43:04] krosenvold_: "Yes"
[09:43:12] simonstewart: Why am I not surprised?
[09:43:13] simonstewart: :)
[09:43:45] krosenvold_: And 32bit->64bit is not "sudo apt.get install 64bit"
[09:43:57] simonstewart: Indeed. It's a big change
[09:45:08] p_l: hmm... can someone point me towards an existing example of WebDriver-based (preferably IE) test suite with open sources?

[09:51:20] *dawagner remembers watching the svn merge from afar

[09:51:38] simonstewart: (ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha)
[09:51:41] krosenvold_: simonstewart: We'll push the rc
[09:51:53] krosenvold_: And I'll add the last 4-5 commits afterwards
[09:51:58] simonstewart: SGTM
[09:52:10] *simonstewart gets a coffee

[09:54:39] simonstewart: This is fair, right? "We will set up an official mirror on github under the SeleniumHQ org so the swivel-eyed, foam-mouthed zealots who mistake a website for a source control system will be happy."
[09:54:58] simonstewart: Ready?

[09:55:39] simonstewart: krosenvold_: go for it
[09:55:46] simonstewart: Source control system flipped on Google Code
[09:55:52] krosenvold_: Coffee in hand !
[09:56:28] simonstewart: there needs to be some sort of drum roll
[09:57:23] simonstewart: krosenvold_: are we nearly there yet? :)
[09:57:51] *krosenvold_ is working
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jan 14 10:00:39 2013]
[10:00:39] simonstewart: OK. It looks Really Easy to add a new repo to the project. I'll do that for the sites in the same way as Luke did on github for the content of www

[10:04:20] simonstewart: Whee!
[10:04:45] simonstewart: Hang on. Where's the rest of it? :)
[10:04:51] krosenvold_: Coming ;)
[10:05:21] krosenvold_: I'm working on the laptop that needs to be replaced with a retina
[10:05:29] simonstewart: ok

[10:05:55] simonstewart: git's cpu bound O_o
[10:06:36] dawagner: Git is display resolution bound?
[10:06:42] krosenvold_: dawagner: Yes
[10:06:58] simonstewart: "80 columns or bust"
[10:07:27] krosenvold_: Seems like the ".netrc" strategy is the way to go
[10:07:36] simonstewart: Yes it is
[10:07:39] simonstewart: Ah.
[10:07:40] simonstewart: Yeah. 
[10:07:45] simonstewart: Could have mentioned that, right?
[10:08:01] krosenvold_: I was fooled by forgetting permissions
[10:08:21] krosenvold_: WHich was, of course, written in 6 point font at the very bottom of the instruction

[10:11:55] krosenvold_: No it isnt
[10:12:04] krosenvold_: Cant do that
[10:12:16] simonstewart: How am I meant to track this in real time by hitting "refresh"? Bah! :)
[10:12:30] krosenvold_: People might start talking about ACID and transactions if they did that
[10:13:00] simonstewart: At google scale, eventually consistent is the way forward
[10:15:47] krosenvold_: Retrying a smaller push
[10:20:17] krosenvold_: Ok, we're in 2010 now
[10:20:24] krosenvold_: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list
[10:20:36] simonstewart: Ohhhh....
[10:21:12] krosenvold_: Is it just me, or do the rest of you have stars on *Every single commit* in that repo ?
[10:21:34] simonstewart: Nope. Just you
[10:21:39] simonstewart: I think because you're pushing
[10:21:41] krosenvold_: Oh wonderful
[10:21:59] simonstewart: You could ask dawagner to ask the Google Code chaps to unstar you from 18456 commits
[10:22:19] krosenvold_: dawagner: ^^^ once we're done ?
[10:22:34] krosenvold_: It seems like google code prefers chunks of a few thousand commits
[10:22:52] simonstewart: krosenvold_: this seems less painful than the giant svn push. 
[10:23:18] krosenvold_: It should be. This is, after all, git !
[10:23:41] simonstewart: I understand that it's the Flash Gordon of source control: it'll save everyone of us
[10:23:53] krosenvold_: Yup
[10:24:05] simonstewart: Really looking forward to the flood of bug fixes and changes once this change is complete
[10:24:45] andreastt: Git conversion of the repo in progress?
[10:24:58] simonstewart: Yup
[10:25:02] andreastt: \o/

[10:50:02] mikronaz: is there any way to set timeout on page load, after link or button click?
[10:51:01] simonstewart: yes
[10:51:39] simonstewart: You need to set the page load strategy to something other than default, and then use driver.manage().timeouts() to modify the page load timeout
[10:54:27] krosenvold_: Ok, it was only the last 6100 commits. Rewriting now

[11:03:59] simonstewart: dawagner: that guava versioning thing is lame
[11:05:00] krosenvold_: simonstewart: once we're live you need to turn off forced push capability on master
[11:05:15] simonstewart: eh?
[11:05:30] krosenvold_: look in google code settings
[11:05:53] krosenvold_: "forced push" 
[11:06:04] krosenvold_: I'm sure there's a flag to disallow it
[11:06:23] krosenvold_: It just means we cannot alter history on "master"
[11:06:33] krosenvold_: Like I just did ;M)
[11:06:38] simonstewart: Ah.
[11:06:57] krosenvold_: Btw; eTA 2MINIUTES
[11:06:58] simonstewart: Can't see that
[11:07:06] simonstewart: (as an option)
[11:07:11] krosenvold_: Maybe dawagner should ask the google chaps
[11:07:16] simonstewart: ^^
[11:07:45] p_l: hmmm... is it good idea to put all the PageFactory and such stuff into "production" sources and use "test" only for tests (if using Maven, and selenium tests are the only thing in the tree)?
[11:08:34] james_o has joined #selenium
[11:08:45] dawagner: Ask google chaps about what?
[11:09:01] krosenvold_: turning off ability to rewrite history on master branch
[11:09:17] krosenvold_: OK THE REPO IS GOOD
[11:09:26] krosenvold_: I will need to push tags in 1 hour or so
[11:09:34] krosenvold_: Due to the rewrite
[11:09:55] krosenvold_: Everyone reclone
[11:10:08] krosenvold_: I'm going to an appointment, back in 50 miniutes

[11:30:03] barancev: JScofi: what archiver do you use?
[11:30:18] JScofi: archiver?  i downloaded the zip from the selenium website
[11:30:26] simonstewart: biab
[11:30:44] JScofi: http://seleniumhq.org/download/
[11:30:56] JScofi: the download link listed for c#
[11:31:10] barancev: JScofi: what software do you use to extract data from the archive?
[11:31:27] JScofi: what archive?  its a download link.  firefox handles that
[11:32:07] JScofi: i normally wouldn't worry about 0 byte files, but i've seen systems break because they're missing one
[11:32:22] JScofi: and i don't know anything about how selenium is set up
[11:32:24] barancev: you told "i tried extracting it from the compressed zip folder" -- what software do you us to extract data? winzip, winrar, 7-zip?
[11:33:00] JScofi: at first i was using the native windows vista extractor, then i moved to 7-zip
[11:33:13] seljenkinsbot has joined #selenium
[11:33:17] JScofi: native got me the files but not the folders, 7-zip got me the folders but not the files
[11:33:32] JScofi: if i try to put them back in one folder (uncompressed) windows yells at me and tells me to stop it
[11:34:34] barancev: it's strange, with 7-zip I can't see any empty files either: http://screencast.com/t/j9fQsD6EJ
[11:35:04] JScofi: are they in the original compression?
[11:35:32] barancev: just downloaded

[11:36:36] JScofi: that googlecode location also lists two 0 byte files in the zip

[13:40:12] krosenvold_: And there was no such thing as implicit defaults
[13:40:48] simonstewart: Right. Do we want all the sites in one repo (analogous to "svn/www") or one repo per site?
[13:41:14] simonstewart: adamgoucher: do we need anything for IDE?
[13:41:34] krosenvold_: simonstewart: I wouldn't know/care

[13:44:18] simonstewart: Hi AutomatedTester 
[13:44:21] simonstewart: We just broke things
[13:44:27] AutomatedTester: orly?
[13:44:33] simonstewart: Well, moved to git
[13:44:40] RossPatterson: I for one welcome our new Git overlords!
[13:44:43] simonstewart: Which is essenitially the same thing, right?
[13:44:52] RossPatterson: (not really, but meh, it's just a VCS :-) )
[13:45:17] simonstewart: Just testing the "which version are we using" patch
[13:45:47] krosenvold_: dawagner: I still appear to have a star on every single commit in the repo
[13:45:56] AutomatedTester: there is nought wrong with SVN
[13:46:06] simonstewart: Yeah, I know
[13:46:24] simonstewart: But, you know, swivel-eyed, foam-mouthed git zealots
[13:46:41] *RossPatterson hands AutomatedTest and simonstewart the SVN-memorial #getoffmylawn :-)
[13:46:46] AutomatedTester: talking of swivel-eyed, foam mouthed zealots, I got a new IPhone 5 today
[13:46:53] simonstewart: zealot
[13:47:00] krosenvold_: actually we've had quite some increase in community involvement for some of the maven projects that switched
[13:47:03] simonstewart: Power button okay?
[13:47:14] AutomatedTester: the new one is perfect
[13:47:23] simonstewart: My conjecture is that participation isn't limited by our source control system
[13:47:32] AutomatedTester: and from using my new one there were other things that were starting to go wrong
[13:47:36] krosenvold_: But of course, the build system in this project is enough to keep most contributors at safe distance 
[13:47:44] AutomatedTester: but now I have a new one there are no scratches on it
[13:47:46] AutomatedTester: yay
[13:48:18] krosenvold_: AutomatedTester: You happy with the 5 ?
[13:48:25] AutomatedTester: krosenvold_: yes

[13:48:52] simonstewart: The java rewrite is fast
[13:48:59] krosenvold_: simonstewart: :P
[13:49:55] krosenvold_: how much faster than the ruby version ?

[13:53:02] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: Moz is getting Byron burger for lunch, will email you the details
[13:53:09] AutomatedTester: so we can get your lunch in too
[13:53:20] simonstewart: right, krosenvold_ 
[13:53:24] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: SGTM
[13:53:58] krosenvold_: simonstewart: Then why the big difference ? Much algorithmic work, or is java that much faster ?
[13:54:08] *dawagner is bitter because he is going to have to cut down his SIM AGAIN to use a 5
[13:54:12] simonstewart: krosenvold_: the java version does a bunch of stuff in parallel
[13:54:43] krosenvold_: Ok, so we cant make this a ruby<->java thing
[13:54:51] simonstewart: nope
[13:55:56] simonstewart: Does selbot track changes to the git repo?
[13:56:26] simonstewart: Just pushed the change to the build system to get the git tag rather than the svn revision

[13:57:24] krosenvold_: Whoa ! We have our first non-svn commit ;)
[13:57:47] andreastt: krosenvold_: :D
[13:58:15] krosenvold_: dawagner: Now I'm sure you can have the google guys unfavourite 16000 commits for me plz. 
[13:58:48] dawagner: Sent an email :)
[13:59:17] AutomatedTester: has selbot been updated?
[13:59:34] dawagner: No
[13:59:50] dawagner: I have a patch, but I can't test it because I can't work out how to bring up a local selbot

[15:57:10] simonstewart: What's that?
[15:57:31] nirvdrum: Commencing the download of everything Mozilla has to offer.
[15:57:43] krosenvold_: It's a post-build script in our lovely build system that works around autogenerated files being constantly flagged as changed
[15:57:54] simonstewart: Well arse
[15:58:16] krosenvold_: The "problem" is that if someone actually wants to change them now, they will have to delete ".git-fixfiles" locally before building
[15:58:44] krosenvold_: It's a file in our root checkout. It's being invoked somewhere in the looneybuild
[15:58:54] jarib: i can get rid of it
[15:58:58] jarib: if that's an ok solution
[15:59:12] simonstewart: OK chaps. From the command line, check that gandi is the DNS provider for the domains you care about

[19:39:41] elopio: lukeis: yes, all the python source, but you don't send to pypi the java stuff, for example
[19:40:11] elopio: I would like to make a clone of what you send to pypi, that's the only thing I need. And not ignore the rest.
[19:40:13] lukeis: yeah, we only send the python stuff + the firefox xpi and IE.dll to pypi
[19:40:18] lukeis: not possible
[19:40:24] lukeis: you need the whole repo
[19:40:34] lukeis: and then run ./go py
[19:40:45] lukeis: because you *need* to build the firefox xpi
[19:41:22] lukeis: there are some prebuilts (like IE.dll) that you won't build unless you have visual studio installed
[19:41:52] sayd: lukeis: are you saying the xpi from the website is out of date?
[19:41:57] lukeis: no
[19:42:18] lukeis: i was talking about the webdriver xpi to elopio
[19:42:24] lukeis: not Selenium IDE
[19:42:35] lukeis: we have more than one xpi in this project :)
[19:42:42] sayd: ok
[19:42:43] elopio: lukeis: ok, that was more or less my question. I just wanted to know if there was a prepared branch for pypi.
[19:42:51] lukeis: nope
[19:42:56] elopio: lukeis: thanks.
[19:42:59] lukeis: np
[19:43:58] sayd: theres not much help in this ide :)
[19:44:59] sayd: i want to do a verifyTextPresent, but not sure what to put in for the target. my id value is edit-title-und-0-value but putting #edit-title-und-0-value in the target and pressing 'find' yields "locator not found"
[19:45:27] lukeis: id=edit-title-und-0-value
[19:45:43] lukeis: not # :)
[19:46:05] lukeis: unless you put css=#yourid
[19:46:26] sayd: ok.. and for value I am putting Selenium Test (no quotes) but its not finding it
[19:46:39] lukeis: try out https://github.com/sebuilder/se-builder  i think there's more 'help' with it
[19:46:54] sayd: lukeis: thanks will look
[19:47:00] *lukeis doesn't use IDE much / at all
[19:47:04] sayd: lukeis: the value should just be a simple string right
[19:47:10] lukeis: dunno
[19:47:30] lukeis: i think you can do a few things with the value
[19:47:52] lukeis: there's some way to store and retrieve variables in it i think
[19:48:34] lukeis: sayd: i suppose this is a better link http://sebuilder.github.com/se-builder/
[19:48:53] sayd: lukeis: yep browsing that now
[19:49:45] lukeis: that is going to be the future Selenium IDE (unless I misread anywhere) it will be replacing Selenium IDE completely
[19:49:58] sayd: lukeis: I think I just needed verifyText and not verifyTextPresent
[19:50:33] *lukeis dislikes testing for text on a page
[19:50:39] sayd: heh
[19:50:58] sayd: yah verifyText didn't do it either. took too long for the page to load im guessing
[19:51:09] Quadlex: lukeis: I was at the Selenium Intermediate to Ninja yesterday
[19:51:13] sam__: krosenvold_ I like the idea of referencing a commit hash with a hash symbol (#) :P
[19:51:15] Quadlex: santiycr isn't a fan either
[19:51:31] sayd: lukeis: Quadlex santiycr whats the better alternative
[19:51:33] lukeis: yeah, santiycr and myself agree on many things :)
[19:52:04] Quadlex: what are you trying to do?
[19:52:09] krosenvold_: 40 chars unprefixed or #CAFEBABE sounds good
[19:52:11] Quadlex: Functional testing?
[19:52:14] Quadlex: Check a page is loaded?
[19:52:23] sayd: Quadlex: check that I can load a post
[19:52:41] sayd: so basically test 1 creates a post (drupal) test 2 loads the list and clicks on the title i just created
[19:52:45] lukeis: krosenvold_: hopefully there's no overlap to our issues numbers like if we get a has that starts with just digits? #1234
[19:52:47] selbot2_: 03 closed/wontfix log error - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1234 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium]
[19:52:58] sayd: i want to verify its on the 'edit' page for said post
[19:53:02] krosenvold_: Drop #
[19:53:36] lukeis: ah
[19:53:50] krosenvold_: We need something else then ;=
[19:54:40] krosenvold_: That *will* of course only be a problem when we get to 6 digits issue numbers. 
[19:54:55] lukeis: we'll get there ;)
[19:55:30] krosenvold_: Next week
[19:56:11] lukeis: nah, we're about a year out from 5 digit numbers
[19:56:19] krosenvold_: ;)
[19:56:26] lukeis: so 6 is the minimum?
[19:56:31] krosenvold_: But we have 5 digit shas now 
[19:56:54] krosenvold_: There is no minimum really
[19:57:20] krosenvold_: Well, probably. But it's too small to be useful
[19:57:25] lukeis: google code shows 12 digits here https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/list
[19:57:49] lukeis: maybe we just do 12 or 40
[19:58:12] krosenvold_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/468370/a-regex-to-match-a-sha1
[19:58:42] lukeis: yeah, already had that regex in my mind
[19:59:45] *santiycr agrees with lukes in the fact that we agree on many things!

[20:01:53] santiycr: we've got davehunt in town
[20:02:09] santiycr: and I missed the last one :)
[20:02:13] lukeis: yes we should! I'm WFH today
[20:02:40] lukeis: davehunt: welcome back to SF :)
[20:02:48] davehunt: thx ::)
[20:02:57] Quadlex: sayd: OK.  So the desired behaviour is that new posts appear in the edit list?
[20:04:13] santiycr: I could do tomorrow, early-ish, like 11:45 to 12:45
[20:04:15] sayd: Quadlex: yeah that would work
[20:04:41] sayd: I'm in sf too! are you guys in the south park area?
[20:05:03] AutomatedTester: what is south park
[20:05:06] AutomatedTester: I must go there
[20:05:19] lukeis: santiycr: would work for me
[20:05:38] lukeis: i work downtown (market & embarcadero)
[20:05:50] sayd: AutomatedTester: its everything you dream of and more
[20:06:08] AutomatedTester: sayd: its in SF... that means its not

[20:06:22] AutomatedTester: novelty points
[20:06:36] Quadlex: sayd: I think we're nearby
[20:06:40] *Quadlex is a recent import
[20:06:45] sayd: AutomatedTester: its cool
[20:07:12] sayd: good burritos
[20:07:50] Quadlex: sayd: OK.  So what's your focus, testing that the edit list (as a concept) contains new posts?
[20:08:09] Quadlex: Or testing that the edit list (as an implementation) contains a link to the post edit view?
[20:08:43] AutomatedTester: sayd: now that sounds interesting
[20:08:48] sayd: Quadlex: Ideally 'loading a post' would mean the post appears in the list, and verifying by clicking that it loads the fields correctly
[20:10:08] Quadlex: So posts have different attributes?
[20:10:27] sayd: Quadlex: yeah, title, body, etc
[20:10:33] sayd: I really just care the title is correct
[20:11:11] sayd: i at least have it working. i had to put in a pause, and im still using verifyText, but its passing

[20:14:51] lukeis: sayd: is it sad that I had to look up south park in SF?  (and I even had a friend live in a building there that I had been to a few timesâ€¦) I normally call that soma ;)
[20:15:21] AutomatedTester: oooo I know soma
[20:15:42] sayd: lukeis: ha, not everyone knows it.. pretty small park, but yeah theres lots of startups and tech there. most of my jobs have been in the same few-block radius around that park
[20:16:28] lukeis: of course I think it could be considered apart of south beachâ€¦ but not many use that name it seems
[20:17:02] sayd: lukeis: right.. i think its technically south beach

[20:20:30] lukeis: freudian slip :)
[20:20:31] santiycr: sayd, lukeis, anyone else intersted: south park tomorrow at 11:45?
[20:20:34] sayd: its more serendipitous than magical
[20:21:21] AutomatedTester: my employer has really nice offices in SF overlooking The Bay Bridge
[20:21:22] santiycr: oh, /me still catching up on your chats
[20:21:42] lukeis: santiycr: sounds good, name the place :)

[22:46:35] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I havent cared about 3.6 since ~ FF12
[22:46:35] sayd: but i guess it would be selenium rc eventually
[22:46:51] lukeis: you should export your test cases to WebDriver format
[22:46:54] nirvdrum: We as the Selenium organization.
[22:47:04] regex: lukeis: Why doesn't the IEDriverServer work well with XP?
[22:47:05] sayd: also in that tool it says: This script contains steps that can't be saved as Selenium 2 yet:
[22:47:08] sayd: clickAndWait clickAndWait 
[22:47:08] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: That stability is one thing I miss about RC.

[22:47:21] lukeis: regex: i dunno :)
[22:47:29] lukeis: does it not?
[22:47:41] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: what do you mean
[22:47:43] sayd: lukeis: is that just the .html format?
[22:47:47] lukeis: no
[22:47:59] sayd: i only see .html and a bunch of rc formats
[22:48:00] lukeis: that's something called 'selenese'
[22:48:07] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: The RC driver seems to work with virtually all FF versions as it doesn't have a native component.
[22:48:55] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the "stability" part can easily be corrected if a Googler exported some IDLs to be placed in Gecko
[22:49:09] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: and I asked for that > 1 year ago
[22:49:27] sayd: should i replace clickAndWait with a click and waitForPageToLoad?
[22:49:32] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Interesting.  I was unaware.
[22:50:03] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: What would the IDL be for?
[22:50:05] AutomatedTester: yea, if the mouse and keyboard idls were exported then we wouldnt need to download gecko each time
[22:50:45] nirvdrum: Does it need to be a Googler?
[22:51:16] AutomatedTester: it did
[22:51:26] AutomatedTester: now I am more interested in Marionette
[22:51:38] nirvdrum: Gotcha.
[22:51:44] AutomatedTester: so now making sure its sorted there properly
[22:51:51] nirvdrum: Sorry, I'm not as familiar with the internals of that as I ought to be.
[22:52:28] AutomatedTester: the touch stuff is being worked on atm
[22:52:39] nirvdrum: And as always, tell me to fuck off if this is well-documented somewhere.
[22:52:48] AutomatedTester: and that will give us an "in" on keyboard stuff
[22:54:15] AutomatedTester: I have already ripped out the typing atom out of marionette
[22:54:21] AutomatedTester: and made it Firefox idiomatic
[22:54:53] AutomatedTester: but its not "native" in the events
