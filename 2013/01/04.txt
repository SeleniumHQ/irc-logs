[06:43:32] dawagner: :note plightbo_work The conclusion of a discussion yesterday (see :log) was that we should move to appengine, have the main site be docs.seleniumhq.org (not by choice, but because otherwise we'll have a permanent redirect loop), and have everything 302 to it.  docs. is currently a convenience CNAME 302ing to drive.google.com - any reason not to change that?

[10:08:41] simonstewart: Do whatever ^F10 would do
[10:09:02] simonstewart: Presumably something exciting
[10:09:02] dawagner: Yeah.  It uses the real keyboard state when determining whether Control was pressed.
[10:09:15] simonstewart: IME, not quite
[10:09:27] simonstewart: It uses a combination of real and synthetic keyboard state
[10:09:38] simonstewart: (try holding down shift while a lower-case string is being typed)

[11:41:47] dawagner: simonstewart: What's the beef with **/* globs?
[11:42:01] simonstewart: Two things. 
[11:42:11] simonstewart: First: I'm too lazy to implement them in Java CrazyFun
[11:42:21] simonstewart: Two: They indicate that we're not entirely sure what's in our code
[11:42:31] simonstewart: The first reason is, I agree, entirely selfish
[11:42:38] simonstewart: The latter is more philosophical
[11:42:43] dawagner: 1 I can patch :P
[11:42:57] simonstewart: What broke?
[11:43:04] simonstewart: Or rather, how did you tell it broke?
[11:43:21] dawagner: 2 I find "This package may have two or three subpackages" a reasonable trade off for not having to change build files frequently
[11:43:32] dawagner: http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Build%20All%20Java/2750/console
[11:43:41] simonstewart: We tend not to create new sub packages _that_ often
[11:44:05] simonstewart: Ahâ€¦ The lift stuff
[11:44:13] dawagner: Which makes the problem worse, because no one remembers you need to change build files when you do rarely add a sub package
[11:44:35] simonstewart: I'm not so sure
[11:44:47] simonstewart: After all, if you've added a new package, you're presumably building that particular target
[11:44:53] dawagner: It doesn't help that I accidentally had the CI turned off for 20 revisions, so it wasn't caught immediately :)
[11:45:02] simonstewart: Arse biscuits

[15:07:13] dawagner: Where is that place?
[15:07:15] jimevans: regex: i just don't understand your architecture. what do you want your code to look like when you consume your library code?
[15:08:38] jimevans: you see, i consider "Checked()" to be a method that only makes sense on a *specific* instance of RadioButton, not as a static method for *all* radio buttons.
[15:08:46] *adamgoucher thinks we should buy this shirt for hugs - twitpic.com/bsfizm
[15:10:02] jimevans: regex: if all you're doing is holding IWebElement instances in your object repository and passing them around to your "element-specific" classes, i'm not sure i entirely see the point.
[15:10:08] regex: jimevans: I'll post it to Github as a draft.  It is an instance available to all RadioButtons.  Because it can be used to determine if ANY radiobutton is either checked or unchecked by returning true or false.  
[15:11:11] regex: For organization and readibility.  It's easier to grab objects that have already been identified by ID, CSS values, etc.  Than have a seperate controller class for behaviors on that object.
[15:14:04] jimevans: regex: and how, exactly, do you retrieve objects from your "object repository"?
[15:14:14] jimevans: can you show me an example of that?
[15:15:51] jimevans: i guess what i'm trying to say is that it sounds like the things you're trying to do as static methods on the RadioButton class (or any tag-specific class, for that matter) would probably be better served as instance methods on instances of that class, from an object-oriented programming perspective.

[15:39:29] jimevans: first, don't use "css=" in your selector for webdriver. that's selenium RC syntax, and doesn't apply.
[15:41:18] jimevans: second, don't use the :contains pseudoselector. it flat-out won't work. it's not part of any W3C CSS selector standard. many people think they can use it because the jQuery bastardization of CSS selectors (a.k.a. "Sizzle") supports it, and people assume jQuery is ubiquitous, but it's not, and the pseudoselector isn't standard.

[16:33:38] lukeis has joined #selenium
[16:35:07] regex: jimevans: IwebElements
[16:35:38] jimevans: then, of course, they won't have a MoveTo() method. you need to wrap them in your custom class which will contain the MoveTo() method.
[16:38:54] regex: Create an instance of Button in a moveto method.  Like an adaptor pattern?
[16:40:27] jimevans: something like that. if it were me, i probably wouldn't store the raw IWebElements in my object repository; i'd wrap them as i found them, and store BaseObjects there.

[17:15:39] barancev: why driver.findElementByTagName("body").getCoordinates().getLocationOnScreen() returns (2,2) in IE 6 and 7?
[17:15:56] barancev: what additional CSS styles should I apply to make it (0,0) ?
[17:16:26] jleyba: barancev: to be blunt, IE 6 and 7 suck monkey balls
[17:17:11] barancev: I know, but... am I asking too much? :)
[17:17:27] jleyba: first, i would add this <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> to <head>
[17:18:21] jimevans: barancev: what does getBoundingClientRect() return for the element?
[17:18:31] jleyba: give me a sec to grab an IE7 VM and I'll play with it
[17:22:15] barancev: jimevans: getBoundingClientRect().left is 2
[17:22:20] barancev: getBoundingClientRect().top is 2 too
[17:22:42] barancev: jleyba: meta does not help
[17:22:44] jimevans: then that's what i'd expect getLocationOnScreen() to return.
[17:23:09] jimevans: or, rather, that's why getLocationOnScreen() returns (2,2) instead of (0,0)
[17:23:11] barancev: jimevans: sure, but the question is -- how to modify the page to get (0,0) ?
[17:23:25] jleyba: barancev: it wouldn't.  that's just to make sure you get a deterministic document mode or newer versions of IE (e.g. IE9 will behave like IE9)
[17:23:33] jleyba: *on newer

[17:26:16] jimevans: from the second: "The simplest runtime implementation is the IE one, thanks to a little-known API that does almost exactly what we want: getBoundingClientRect. Almost exactly as we quickly discovered it has a weird 2-pixel offset except on IE6 if the HTML element has a border"
[17:26:43] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[17:26:57] alexglow has joined #selenium
[17:29:47] barancev: jimevans: then, should not we subtract these 2 pixels when we calculate coordinates in selenium?

[17:30:16] barancev: and, btw, I see the same in IE7

[17:32:18] barancev: instead of getBoundingClientRect()
[17:33:43] barancev: a radical approach would be to stop support for IE 6 and 7, though :)
[17:34:30] jimevans: the root cause of the problem is that there is a 2-pixel border on the <html> element in IE <= 7.

[17:43:06] jimevans: jleyba: buy a real computer? or just use a "real" OS?

[17:45:10] barancev: hating windows != hating windows end line formatting
[17:46:19] RossPatterson: lukeis: Any decent Subversion client normalizes line endings in text files.  If yours didn't, you probably have a filetype-configuration problem.
[17:46:37] lukeis: i use the command line ;)
[17:47:17] lukeis: easy enough fix though...
[17:47:53] jleyba: barancev: i can't find enough js clues to handle that 2px offset
[17:48:04] RossPatterson: lukeis: It's still a client, the Subversion command line client, and it still honors the svn:eol-style property on the files.
[17:48:34] jleyba: i suggest we just accept it and move on
[17:49:00] RossPatterson: lukeis: Most likely, the files don't have svn:eol-style set.  Which you can fix (set it to "native") and check the change in, which will benefit all users on all platforms.
[17:49:47] barancev: jleyba: "accept it" == "document it to warn the users that locations are 2px wrong in IE 6 and 7" ?
[17:49:57] barancev: why not fix it instead?
[17:50:54] lukeis: damn you box IE box model
[17:50:57] lukeis: ;)
[17:51:16] lukeis: RossPatterson: I'll have to look that one up, never used it before
[17:51:41] jleyba: barancev: i guess we could document it.  devs targeting ie 6 and 7 should be familiar with those quirks any way
[17:52:13] jleyba: you can't "fix it" b/c as jimevans said, there aren't enough reliable clues to tell you have IE6/7 and need to adjust the coordinates
[17:52:30] barancev: jleyba: I'm afraifd this 2px shift can affect Actions
[17:52:33] jimevans: barancev: question is, what happens in IE8+ if you're in quirks or IE 7 document mode?
[17:52:37] lukeis: jleyba: dev's mayâ€¦ but testers may not (not everywhere has dev's as testers)
[17:52:49] jleyba: jimevans: i can reproduce it in ie9 in doc mode 7
[17:53:04] jimevans: well, shit, then. that makes it much harder to fix.
[17:53:44] jleyba: jimevans: https://gist.github.com/4454579
[17:53:44] jimevans: if it was just browser version, it'd be relatively easy to do in the IE driver (the fix is not in the atoms)

[18:41:58] jleyba: it's detecting ie7, but there are a lot of edge cases to the top left of document.body
[18:42:00] jimevans: what does compatMode return when in quirks mode?
[18:42:08] jleyba: Backcompat I think
[18:42:15] jimevans: i think so too.
[18:42:31] jleyba: BackCompat
[18:42:52] jimevans: time for some refactoring.
[18:43:05] jimevans: been meaning to do this anyway.
[18:43:28] jleyba: amazing how differently that page renders
[18:44:35] jleyba: the green box should be slightly below the red box.  8/9 get it right.  7 renders it above, and quirks aligns them vertically
[18:45:35] jimevans: rendering is hard. let's go shopping!

[19:00:02] jimevans: regex: glad it worked out for you.
[19:01:26] regex: jimevans: The moveTo() method currently requires the IwebElement to be passed into it.  So when I have myTextBox.MoveTo().  I'd have to go .MoveTo(element). 
[19:02:04] regex: How do I fix this so that it automically picks up the location from the Object Repository.  I'm assuming an observor pattern of some sort.
[19:04:58] jimevans: can you show me what your MoveTo() method looks like? and what are you expecting it to do?
[19:10:37] regex: https://gist.github.com/4455119
[19:13:31] jimevans: In this case, MoveTo() should have no arguments, and should call actionProvider.MoveToElement(this.objectName).
[19:14:11] jimevans: same for DoubleClick();
[19:14:18] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[19:14:25] jimevans: and they shouldn't be static.
[19:14:54] jimevans: this is *exactly* the same pattern as the previous methods. you should be able to extrapolate from there.
[19:14:57] regex: They don't show up with the dot operator if they're not static.
[19:16:26] jimevans: okay, once again, these are methods you should be calling on the instance of the BaseObject (or its subclass) that you retrieve from the object repository.

[19:17:39] llaskin: anyone here good with the jenkins CLI?
[19:17:47] jimevans: i don't know how much plainer i can make it. this is the *exact* *same* *pattern* as the Click() and Exists() methods in your BaseObject class.
[19:19:04] jleyba: jimevans: here's an updated version of that page that prints out click coordinates.  useful for debugging -> https://gist.github.com/4455172
[19:21:45] regex: I apologize for not understanding jimevans.  You're very smart.  I simply didn't have enough time to put the pieces together.  Bada bing though.  It worked this time! 
[19:23:52] jimevans: no need to apologize. i'd recommend a little more research into object-oriented programming concepts, and c# programming in particular.
[19:23:54] regex: jimevans: You are a a genius. 
[19:24:31] jimevans: glad to help
[19:24:50] dawagner: llaskin: I've used the CLI a bit.  It's one of the biggest pieces of shit I've ever used.
[19:25:12] jleyba: wow, harsh
[19:26:00] dawagner: Well earned.
[19:26:21] RossPatterson: I dunno.  There's a lot of competition for that title.
[19:26:40] dawagner: Every time I want to use it, it takes me an hour to work out how to authenticate to it.
[19:26:48] dawagner: It has no docmentation or helpstrings
[19:26:53] dawagner: It has implicit arguments.
[19:27:01] dawagner: Its calls succeed about one in thirty attempts
[19:27:08] dawagner: And it gives no feedback as to whether a call succeeded or not
[19:27:10] dawagner: And if not, why not
[19:27:39] RossPatterson: OK, maybe you're right :-)

[19:34:42] dawagner: IIRC using private keys was the only way I could get auth to work
[19:34:44] dawagner: Yeah
[19:34:45] lukeis: llaskin: this seems fairly obviousâ€¦ hudson.security.AccessDeniedException2: anonymous is missing the Read permission   do you have anonymous access to everything?
[19:34:53] llaskin: no anonymous access
[19:35:14] dawagner: I think you need to pass your username and private key to every command somehow

[19:43:03] regex: jimevans: Hope you have a nice weekend.  I'm building this architecture out here (I know you disagree with parts).  I've been doing C# for about 2 years.  I have about 5 years of automation.  I'm a humble guy.  I also have a graduate degree in Computer Science.  I get hung up on small problems however.
[19:44:58] jimevans: regex: to be fair, i'm sure i don't have a complete understanding of the architecture you're trying to build.
[19:47:33] jimevans: regex: good luck with your project. i'm glad i was able to help in some small way.

[20:32:51] jimevans: not exactly
[20:32:54] barancev: or scrollbar is a different issue?
[20:33:04] jimevans: scrollbars would be different
[20:33:41] barancev: ok, I just want to say that I can reproduce this in 2.28
[20:34:47] barancev: sounds like the scrollbar width should be subtracted from the viewport width
[20:34:48] jimevans: not surprising. until very recently, we didn't take any scrollbars into account 
[20:35:08] jimevans: now we do for some frame scenarios.
[20:35:38] jimevans: i'm in the middle of something else with the IE driver at the moment, but will put that on the queue.
[20:40:02] barancev: not surprisingly, scrollbar size is different in various IE versions
[20:41:04] lukeis: barancev: and customizable via css or operating system
[20:42:57] jimevans: lukeis: scrollbar width is customizable via css?
[20:43:20] lukeis: not sure about width, but you can do weird things :)
[20:44:04] sevensoft has joined #selenium
[20:47:59] barancev: scrollbar size can be obtained from the registry: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa451993.aspx
[20:48:21] jimevans: barancev: the right way to do it is to call the GetSystemMetrics() API.
[20:48:52] barancev: right
[20:49:23] jimevans: the docs page you linked to is for IE6 on windows CE
[20:50:29] sevensoft: what i'm currently trying to solve is how to best record (in our own DB for example) when a user starts a session and when they either close it or it gets cleaned up..
[20:51:06] sevensoft: i know about the servlets that can be added to the hub... but those are just adding new paths to the hub.. not readily apparent to me that would be the place i want to do it..
[20:51:33] sevensoft: i see the listeners on the proxies
[20:51:36] barancev: jimevans: yes, I've already found info about GetSystemMetrics, http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724385(v=vs.85).aspx
[20:52:20] sevensoft: but short of specifying my own proxy that extends the defaultRemoteproxy and implements a new listener or something like that.. how should i best tack on functionality like that?
[20:53:26] nirvdrum: sevensoft: That's the way you would do it.  Unless you wanted to get into log parsing.

[20:54:51] sevensoft: nirvdrum: thx.. thought of that too.. but that will mean log parsing across many nodes (unless i'm logging to syslog or something)... seems like pain.. 
[20:55:44] Adam_ has joined #selenium
[20:55:59] nirvdrum: sevensoft: Indeed.  I have a forthcoming blog post on how to log to graylog.  I guess you could then query the ElasticSearch server.

[20:58:05] barancev: jimevans: no new prebuilts?
[20:58:15] jimevans: not yet.
[20:58:20] sevensoft: nirvdrum: i suspect that I would have other functionality that I would want to do on the node in realtime rather than log parsing..  if it was strictly for identifying usage.. that would be ok.. 
[20:58:26] nirvdrum: I have my hub and all my nodes logging to a central graylog installation.  It makes debugging a hell of a lot easier.
[20:58:28] barancev: (CI uses prebuilt driver)
[20:58:57] sevensoft: but i'm thinking along the lines of video recording the session..i may want it to trigger something like offloading the recording to a central server before the vm is reclaimed.. 
[20:59:22] sevensoft: may or may not be the best place to do it.. but just trying to understand capabilities so i decide the best place
[20:59:33] nirvdrum: sevensoft: A custom proxy is your way forward then.  It shouldn't be that hard, aside from the astounding lack of documentation.
