[2013-05-03 04:02:05] Ardesco: google maps app with SVG's
[2013-05-03 04:02:19] Ardesco: IE8 chokes on it a bit and doesn't render SVG's
[2013-05-03 04:02:20] AutomatedTester: well thats your problem
[2013-05-03 04:02:29] Ardesco: oh yes, nothing to do with selenium
[2013-05-03 04:02:40] Ardesco: just the fact that IE8 is awkward in general
[2013-05-03 04:02:41] AutomatedTester: and nothing to do with IE8...
[2013-05-03 04:02:55] AutomatedTester: IE8 is a little long in the tooth and doesnt do SVG
[2013-05-03 04:02:58] AutomatedTester: does its own thing

[2013-05-03 04:03:14] Ardesco: our test runs are great, and everything is green most of the time
[2013-05-03 04:03:42] Ardesco: the problem is the business wants a modern site using all the latest tech *and* they want IE8 compatability
[2013-05-03 04:03:48] Ardesco: which is a sruglle
[2013-05-03 04:04:01] Ardesco: been pushing hard for the past 7 months to bin IE8 support
[2013-05-03 04:04:25] AutomatedTester: well that's silly
[2013-05-03 04:04:25] Ardesco: but some director somewhere has decided that all the potential customers are locked in IE8 land so we have to support
[2013-05-03 04:04:40] AutomatedTester: then they should get an IE8 experience
[2013-05-03 04:04:47] Ardesco: (this isn't backed up with evidence, evidence collected from the trial suggests everybody is using either chrome or firefox))
[2013-05-03 04:05:00] *AutomatedTester mutters about the futility of pixel perfect across browsers...'
[2013-05-03 04:05:12] Ardesco: tell me about it
[2013-05-03 04:05:30] Ardesco: also IE8's JS engine just isn't really up to what we are asking of it
[2013-05-03 04:05:50] AutomatedTester: The web, and nirvdrum is my proponent in this area, was designed to degrade gracefully
[2013-05-03 04:05:51] Ardesco: it's not horrific, but it doesn't feel snappy
[2013-05-03 04:06:02] AutomatedTester: having drop shadows everywhere is stupid
[2013-05-03 04:06:11] AutomatedTester: give people the experience they expect

[2013-05-03 04:08:04] Ardesco: 1 sorry

[2013-05-03 04:08:48] AutomatedTester: so people could wait 1 week to actually use the site
[2013-05-03 04:08:57] Ardesco: yesterday somebody mentioned fixing and back porting something
[2013-05-03 04:09:02] Ardesco: #facepalm
[2013-05-03 04:09:12] *AutomatedTester feels that you are the wrong person to tell this too'

[2013-05-03 04:10:35] AutomatedTester: if, and only if, you have precommit testing
[2013-05-03 04:11:15] Ardesco: devs have to run a full build that does all unit tests, all integration tests and all acceptance tests (including rest layer and selenium tests) before they can push code
[2013-05-03 04:11:36] AutomatedTester: thats not always scalable...
[2013-05-03 04:11:41] AutomatedTester: I talk from experience
[2013-05-03 04:11:46] Ardesco: CI then does all of that again on a live like environment and then runs all selenium tests against all supported browsers

[2013-05-03 04:13:53] AutomatedTester: I know the top 3 browser vendors are having scaling issues atm
[2013-05-03 04:14:12] AutomatedTester: my career is starting to look a lot like andreastt
[2013-05-03 04:14:25] Ardesco: theoretically if we keep throwing hardware at it it's infinitely scalable (until it gets too expensive to throw hardware at it)
[2013-05-03 04:14:44] andreastt: Pre-integration testing a browser is Very Hard.
[2013-05-03 04:14:51] andreastt: No, it doesn't always scale.
[2013-05-03 04:14:52] Ardesco: is that a good thing or a bad thing?
[2013-05-03 04:15:02] AutomatedTester: bad thing
[2013-05-03 04:15:08] andreastt: Specifically building is hard to scale because C++ takes forever to compile.
[2013-05-03 04:15:22] andreastt: There are certain parts of the build process that you can't parallelize, such as linking.
[2013-05-03 04:15:25] AutomatedTester: we have pile up failures
[2013-05-03 04:15:30] AutomatedTester: which makes us sad
[2013-05-03 04:15:49] AutomatedTester: we're investigating different ways to prevent that and keep the tree open
[2013-05-03 04:15:55] jaan_: hi, can someone help me with a issue, i'm trying to run selenium with phantomjs. currently i get an exception: HTML suite exception seen:

[2013-05-03 04:15:56] AutomatedTester: and lessen the load on our infra
[2013-05-03 04:16:30] AutomatedTester: jaan_: iirc RC wont work against PhantomJS
[2013-05-03 04:16:34] AutomatedTester: you need webdriver
[2013-05-03 04:17:21] Ardesco: thankfully we shouldn't see that as it's just a web app
[2013-05-03 04:17:40] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: Google core are seeing that problem
[2013-05-03 04:17:57] Ardesco: I don't think it will ever get to that size
[2013-05-03 04:18:13] AutomatedTester: granted their code base is much bigger than yours and have probably 2400x more engineers
[2013-05-03 04:18:13] Ardesco: it's a very limited and specialised market that it's aimed at
[2013-05-03 04:18:37] Ardesco: I may well be wrong
[2013-05-03 04:19:06] Ardesco: but if it does happen we will need to re-evaluate things :)

[2013-05-03 04:22:37] Ardesco: out there?
[2013-05-03 04:22:55] Dadadam: When starting chrome, it creates some temporary folders in /tmp called .org.chromium.Chromium.uniqueString.
[2013-05-03 04:24:16] Dadadam: In one of these folders there is a subfolder called defaults which contains User Stylecheets, which in turn contains custom.css, I need to populate this file with some stuff that I need for my selenium-tasks.
[2013-05-03 04:24:23] Dadadam: Does anyone know how to do that?
[2013-05-03 04:25:06] Dadadam: (In a nice way, not hackish "echo 'what i need' > /path/custom.css" kinda-way) :)
[2013-05-03 04:25:54] AutomatedTester: Dadadam: is there something that you can pass to via desired capabilities?
[2013-05-03 04:26:04] AutomatedTester: I dont know what you can/cant do with that on Chrome
[2013-05-03 04:26:15] andreastt: AutomatedTester: BTW, keeping the tree open is easy; but it depends what quality level you're expecting master to have.
[2013-05-03 04:26:28] AutomatedTester: we have a very high bar

[2013-05-03 04:26:41] andreastt: Like Chromium, we don't expect it to be prestine.
[2013-05-03 04:27:03] AutomatedTester: we dont expect prestine but we dont expect crap either
[2013-05-03 04:27:08] AutomatedTester: we back out before we close
[2013-05-03 04:27:23] andreastt: In the past we expected it to be, with Presto.
[2013-05-03 04:27:27] AutomatedTester: our tree is currently closed but that's infra issues
[2013-05-03 04:27:31] andreastt: But now we need to stay on top of the Chromium updates.
[2013-05-03 04:27:59] AutomatedTester: wow... tree is closed for 2 reasons
[2013-05-03 04:28:09] AutomatedTester: perma-orange and infra issues

[2013-05-03 04:32:24] Ardesco: otherwise no idea i'm afraid
[2013-05-03 04:38:40] AutomatedTester: wow... UKIP appeared to have done well yesterday...
[2013-05-03 04:38:44] AutomatedTester: not a good thing...
[2013-05-03 04:41:34] Ardesco: dunno what they stand for really
[2013-05-03 04:42:02] AutomatedTester: Get the UK out of the EU and limit immigration into the UK
[2013-05-03 04:42:07] AutomatedTester: thats their main two
[2013-05-03 04:42:45] AutomatedTester: they appear to be mainly made up of The Sun/The Daily Mail readers who thing people just come here for benefits
[2013-05-03 04:42:53] Ardesco: well getting UK out of the EU will automatically do the second
[2013-05-03 04:43:13] Ardesco: I don't see why people get so uptight about immigration though
[2013-05-03 04:43:32] AutomatedTester: "They are coming to take my job"
[2013-05-03 04:43:38] Ardesco: unless you are pale skinned with ginger hair your an immigrant somewhere along the line
[2013-05-03 04:43:52] Ardesco: even if you are you may be an immigrant
[2013-05-03 04:43:53] Ardesco: :)
[2013-05-03 04:44:05] Ardesco: *you're
[2013-05-03 04:44:05] AutomatedTester: its the "stealing" of jobs
[2013-05-03 04:44:09] Ardesco: pftt
[2013-05-03 04:44:19] AutomatedTester: which is rediculous
[2013-05-03 04:44:44] AutomatedTester: immigrants tend to take jobs that "native" UK people think are below them
[2013-05-03 04:44:46] Ardesco: the jobs that are supposedly "stolen" are jobs that the indigenous population won't do anyway because they think they deserve a better job
[2013-05-03 04:45:01] Ardesco: heh
[2013-05-03 04:45:10] Ardesco: thinking exactly the same thing
[2013-05-03 04:45:52] p0deje, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-03 04:45:55] Ardesco: the others thing is the farce about immigrants stealing benefits
[2013-05-03 04:46:11] AutomatedTester: yea... thats bullshit too
[2013-05-03 04:46:19] Ardesco: you don't get benefits the second you walk in the country, but papers like the daily mail don't like pointing that out
[2013-05-03 04:46:54] AutomatedTester: if you come from the EU, you need to prove you require the benefits and then get added to the HUGE waiting list
[2013-05-03 04:47:25] AutomatedTester: if you are not from the EU, you get put in a immigrant center and get below the poverty line funds to keep you "alive"
[2013-05-03 04:47:54] AutomatedTester: I think they get £39  compared to a normal benefit person's £120
[2013-05-03 04:48:12] AutomatedTester: figures might not be right but the difference is large like that
[2013-05-03 04:48:17] Ardesco: and if you're not from the EU there is a good chance you'll be sent back anyway
[2013-05-03 04:48:28] AutomatedTester: yea
[2013-05-03 04:48:53] *AutomatedTester notes under UKIP policies I *could* be removed from the UK'
[2013-05-03 04:49:46] AutomatedTester: even though I pay a shit load of tax
[2013-05-03 04:50:36] AutomatedTester: but I digress
[2013-05-03 04:51:37] Ardesco: heh don't get me started about idea's of a 75% tax rate for people earning over £1million or whatever it was
[2013-05-03 04:51:57] AutomatedTester: I am NO WHERE NEAR that...
[2013-05-03 04:52:11] Ardesco: if I ever manage to earn over a million I will be totally pissed if an even higher percentage is taken away from me
[2013-05-03 04:52:19] Ardesco: I am no where near that either
[2013-05-03 04:52:36] AutomatedTester: I'd be happy with 6 figure incone
[2013-05-03 04:52:37] Ardesco: but continually increasing percentages as you earn more is not fair IMHO
[2013-05-03 04:52:53] AutomatedTester: income*
[2013-05-03 04:52:55] Ardesco: you already pay a shit load more, that's how percentages work
[2013-05-03 04:53:26] Ardesco: by upping the percentage as people earn more you force them to either limit their earning which = less tax income or you get them to do creative accounting which = less tax income
[2013-05-03 04:54:23] Ardesco: I'm saving that rant for if I ever hit the big time
[2013-05-03 04:54:25] Ardesco: ;)
[2013-05-03 04:54:43] *Ardesco goes and buys another lottery ticket online'
[2013-05-03 04:54:59] AutomatedTester: i just got a quote to do work on the house
[2013-05-03 04:55:03] AutomatedTester: I need to win the lotto
[2013-05-03 04:55:34] AutomatedTester: bigger house ftw
[2013-05-03 04:56:00] Ardesco: heh we just got our plans in
[2013-05-03 04:56:05] Ardesco: looks like it's going to be a few years
[2013-05-03 04:56:06] Ardesco: :)
[2013-05-03 04:56:20] AutomatedTester: we're hopefully starting in 2 weeks
[2013-05-03 04:56:45] Ardesco: i'm hoping once the plans are approved it will increase the value enough to give us a slightly better LTV on the mortgage
[2013-05-03 04:56:46] AutomatedTester: but each bedroom will gain ~5m^2
[2013-05-03 04:56:49] Ardesco: cool
[2013-05-03 04:57:00] Ardesco: sounds well worth doing
[2013-05-03 04:57:21] AutomatedTester: since its a bungalow and we have hip roof on each end we are making them gables
[2013-05-03 04:57:27] AutomatedTester: and adding dorma's
[2013-05-03 04:57:32] Ardesco: we will be putting in a extra bedroom so that if either my, or Mili's parents need somewhere we have space

[2013-05-03 07:21:52] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, I tried going back to shutils and everything seams to be normal. After that I can run the setup.py test command without getting a lot of unneeded output.
[2013-05-03 07:22:17] AutomatedTester: what is the problem you are having?
[2013-05-03 07:22:28] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, getting a lot of output when running unit tests via setup.py
[2013-05-03 07:22:42] AutomatedTester: we dont run tests via setup.py

[2013-05-03 07:24:48] bikeshedder: Well, I do run the unit tests of my library as part of setup.py test. dir_util.copy_tree is very verbose when the logging is configured by setuptools.

[2013-05-03 07:26:55] bikeshedder: Right now I'm looking at #3339 and #3204 to see if there might be any reason why distutils.dir_util was picked. As far as I can tell the only difference is the preserve_symlinks=1 argument. shutil.copytree supports that too via symlinks=True. Is there a selenium test suite that I can run before submitting a pull request?

[2013-05-03 07:30:39] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, distutils is not used anywhere else in the selenium codebase. Distutils is only meant for packaging and not during runtime so I think using this functions is a bad idea.
[2013-05-03 07:31:43] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: ./go test_py will run the tests
[2013-05-03 07:32:21] bikeshedder: okay, I'm still cloning the repository. 640 MiB and counting. Selenium is kinda huge.
[2013-05-03 07:32:37] AutomatedTester: yea... everyone wanted GIT and this is the result
[2013-05-03 07:32:53] Ardesco: but git it goooood
[2013-05-03 07:33:04] AutomatedTester: yea...
[2013-05-03 07:33:06] Ardesco: i'm offered more patches since git came in
[2013-05-03 07:33:06] bikeshedder: mmmh, I don't think this is the fault of git. Even the linux kernel uses it and it clones much faster
[2013-05-03 07:33:30] Ardesco: i'm = I've
[2013-05-03 07:33:30] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: we need binary objects
[2013-05-03 07:33:32] Ardesco: can't type today
[2013-05-03 07:33:58] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: thats github not git
[2013-05-03 07:33:59] Ardesco: see this is good too
[2013-05-03 07:34:00] Ardesco: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/pulls
[2013-05-03 07:34:14] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: if google code had a similar thing for SVN i suspect we would have had the same
[2013-05-03 07:34:18] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, in this case Git is not a very good idea. The binary objects should better be stored somewhere else then.
[2013-05-03 07:34:39] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: and that breaks our checkout 1 tree rule
[2013-05-03 07:35:00] AutomatedTester: multiple repos have the same problems as binary objects in the tree
[2013-05-03 07:35:23] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, what kind of binary objects?
[2013-05-03 07:36:42] Ardesco: you know what you need AutomatedTester

[2013-05-03 07:36:50] Ardesco: you need to have a dependency management system
[2013-05-03 07:37:00] Ardesco: move selenium codebase over to maven
[2013-05-03 07:37:03] Ardesco: taadaaa
[2013-05-03 07:37:19] bikeshedder: Ardesco, that sounds even worse.
[2013-05-03 07:37:25] Ardesco: one clean checkout that can putl down all the dependencies at run time
[2013-05-03 07:37:34] barancev|2: maven with ruby and python and JS subprojects is a PITA
[2013-05-03 07:37:38] bikeshedder: Reminds me of one of my favourite quotes: "I have a problem... I'll use XML... now I have two problems."
[2013-05-03 07:38:04] barancev|2: we store prebuilt libs and binaries for FF and IE
[2013-05-03 07:38:18] Ardesco: that reminds me of one of my favourite quotes
[2013-05-03 07:38:25] Ardesco: I had a problem, so I used threading
[2013-05-03 07:38:34] Ardesco: now two problems i have
[2013-05-03 07:39:12] barancev|2: one reason why we store prebuilts is because CI server can't build them
[2013-05-03 07:39:17] bikeshedder: barancev|2, wouldn't it make more sense to create proper releases and store them in an archive server?
[2013-05-03 07:39:37] bikeshedder: barancev|2, but keeping release builds in the repo sounds like a really bad idea
[2013-05-03 07:39:53] barancev|2: who said "release builds"?
[2013-05-03 07:39:58] Ardesco: you could have a maven plugin that downloads prebuilts from an ftp server!
[2013-05-03 07:40:24] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: compiled C++ objects
[2013-05-03 07:40:25] bikeshedder: barancev|2, s/release builds/prebuilds/ ... whatever you call it.
[2013-05-03 07:40:28] barancev|2: we push IE binary after almost every change to IE driver c++ code
[2013-05-03 07:40:31] AutomatedTester: java jars
[2013-05-03 07:40:42] Ardesco: so push it to ftp
[2013-05-03 07:40:46] Ardesco: ;)
[2013-05-03 07:41:04] *AutomatedTester leaves this discussion because he sees it going in circles'
[2013-05-03 07:41:04] barancev|2: java jars can be loaded from maven central repo, it's not a problem
[2013-05-03 07:41:19] barancev|2: IE and FF binaries are
[2013-05-03 07:41:33] Ardesco: GRADLE!
[2013-05-03 07:41:42] Ardesco: then you can pull binaries from any location
[2013-05-03 07:41:43] barancev|2: creating "another repo for binaries" is a PITA either
[2013-05-03 07:41:45] ShawnM, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2013-05-03 07:41:54] Ardesco: and you could also move the core java codebase to groovy
[2013-05-03 07:42:00] AutomatedTester: multiple repos is a bad idea
[2013-05-03 07:42:21] AutomatedTester: requiring a "build" step to get everything before building is a bad idea
[2013-05-03 07:42:26] *Ardesco has to stop trolling now'
[2013-05-03 07:42:29] bikeshedder: barancev|2, you already download stuff from external sites ... I just started the unit tests and now it is fetching xulrunner-2.0
[2013-05-03 07:43:00] Ardesco: if it doesn't work the first time doesn't everybody just keep trying until it does?

[2013-05-03 07:44:51] AutomatedTester: and will fall back to the prebuilts
[2013-05-03 07:45:33] bikeshedder: You got to be kidding me? That's even worse. So you are telling me that depending on the internet connectivity I might get a different test result because I'm using different libraries?
[2013-05-03 07:46:44] barancev|2: I'm not a fan of building and tuning the build system. it works for me as it is. talk to simonstewart :)
[2013-05-03 07:47:10] AutomatedTester: if you change the C++ code that requires the SDK and its not there and you dont have internet its not going get your build details
[2013-05-03 07:47:38] cgoldberg, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-03 07:47:47] AutomatedTester: but if you change the .NET/Python/Ruby/Java code and not having the SDK makes no difference to the end result
[2013-05-03 07:48:14] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, so I don't get what you need the prebuild stuff in the repo for?
[2013-05-03 07:48:42] AutomatedTester: the IEDriver stuff requires VS Professional edition to compile
[2013-05-03 07:48:47] AutomatedTester: not everyone has that
[2013-05-03 07:49:24] bikeshedder: okay, but that's something I'd call a "release" and not something I want to keep in the repository, no?
[2013-05-03 07:49:26] barancev|2: because there are two camps -- ones who love external deps, and ones who loves to store anyhing to the repo. we are in the second camp :)
[2013-05-03 07:49:29] rananda, quitting. (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
[2013-05-03 07:49:59] AutomatedTester: which means that any change makes a release
[2013-05-03 07:50:35] AutomatedTester: e.g. barancev|2 makes a change, I dont have VS Pro edition and I want to test before all our users, or on our CI which doesnt have all our tools
[2013-05-03 07:50:52] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, if you want to release that new binary files to the public, yes. Anyone else who is coding should have a proper compiler at his/her hands and can compile it from source.
[2013-05-03 07:51:09] barancev|2: "should have"?
[2013-05-03 07:51:20] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: *should* is not reality
[2013-05-03 07:51:24] AutomatedTester: not even close to reality
[2013-05-03 07:51:50] barancev|2: I should have macos? and VS Pro? and a Linux box?
[2013-05-03 07:52:21] AutomatedTester: then if I want to release the python code from OSX, I need the linux compiled C++ code that go into the egg
[2013-05-03 07:52:55] AutomatedTester: and the same for the Windows Firefox C++ code we have
[2013-05-03 07:53:24] AutomatedTester: so assume I have all the tools required to build, I now need all the platforms
[2013-05-03 07:53:27] AutomatedTester: then I compile
[2013-05-03 07:53:39] barancev|2: yes, we can stop pushing external jars to the repo, but we can't stop pushing our prebuilts
[2013-05-03 07:53:46] barancev|2: and we follow The Rule of One Repo
[2013-05-03 07:53:52] AutomatedTester: then I need to sync to one of the platforms before pushing to pypi
[2013-05-03 07:54:00] bikeshedder: oh my.
[2013-05-03 07:54:21] *AutomatedTester wishes selenium was a "average" project and we could do those things'
[2013-05-03 07:54:43] bikeshedder: Use a separate repository for releases and the pain ends. For god sake, the "one repo rule" is just stupid. "one repo for the source" is okay, but doing releases in the same repo is just insane.
[2013-05-03 07:55:28] barancev|2: but m-day is soon to save us!

[2013-05-03 07:56:34] barancev|2: bikeshedder: I can say in the same tone: "using several repos is just insane!" so what? :)
[2013-05-03 07:57:01] AutomatedTester: doing something other than trunk based development is insane imo
[2013-05-03 07:57:33] AutomatedTester: but we're all entitled to our opinion
[2013-05-03 07:57:57] bikeshedder: barancev|2, one repo for she source, one for everything else. Then use Git for the sources because it rocks and SVN for the binary stuff because it does not require a complete local checkout. Problem solved, no?
[2013-05-03 07:58:43] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: i'm not trolling but are you being in anyway serious? 2 different VCS to solve a problem
[2013-05-03 07:58:47] AutomatedTester: ?

[2013-05-03 07:59:12] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, VCS are not meant to be used for releases. At least Git is very bad at it.

[2013-05-03 08:00:16] AutomatedTester: we upload our "released" version to something that isnt the tree

[2013-05-03 08:01:15] AutomatedTester: but if we have 2 repos we now need to tell our build system to understand multiple repos
[2013-05-03 08:01:27] AutomatedTester: and in my experience that is a major smell for build system

[2013-05-03 08:06:22] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, I really don't mean to troll. I just see that this is going to end really badly. Right now the "source" repo is 750 MiB in size and it will keep growing in the future. And that huge size is only because of the binaries that are being checked in. If I understand you correctly you let various ppl. run the compile jobs and let them check in the bits you need for releases. Then when all bits are there you start the
[2013-05-03 08:06:22] bikeshedder: build job to create the release with all prebuild files?

[2013-05-03 08:07:45] AutomatedTester: yes
[2013-05-03 08:09:19] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: we have extensive CIs that manage that for regressions
[2013-05-03 08:09:29] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: the CIs rely on the prebuilt
[2013-05-03 08:09:55] AutomatedTester: bikeshedder: remember we arent a company, we are a bunch of volunteers that dont have access to every tool
[2013-05-03 08:10:05] bikeshedder: AutomatedTester, then I simply don't get it what is so evil about keeping the binary files for the release in a separate repository. It should be rather simple and keep the source repository free of binary stuff.
[2013-05-03 08:10:22] bikeshedder: never mind, I'm just wondering.
[2013-05-03 08:11:11] bikeshedder: If this workflow works for you - great... I found it rather frightening that the source repository is >750 MiB big. O_o
[2013-05-03 08:11:20] AutomatedTester: yup...
[2013-05-03 08:11:36] AutomatedTester: in SVN it was huge
[2013-05-03 08:11:46] AutomatedTester: and its not just binaries
[2013-05-03 08:11:54] AutomatedTester: but in GIT the issue is multiplied

[2013-05-03 12:05:57] santiycr: after 10s of your scripts waiting, we start sending a response
[2013-05-03 12:06:11] santiycr: just to avoid tcp timeouts in their end
[2013-05-03 12:06:28] santiycr: we start by sending the http status code of 303

[2013-05-03 14:13:48] KaibutsuX: you have to have chromedriver somewhere on your system, that's how webdriver connects to chrome

[2013-05-03 14:14:27] foist: So I'm already using that, no?

[2013-05-03 14:47:57] dross: question, I was reading through the wiki and I understand selenium can be used to extract text for verification. Can Selenium be used to say "What's the div in the center of the screen?" and "Is the div named 'content' really a side bar?"
[2013-05-03 14:48:06] Wessix, joining. (#selenium)
[2013-05-03 14:48:21] dross: I'm trying to detect if content from certain selectors is the correct content or if it's crap
[2013-05-03 14:48:27] Dude-X: well text as in HTML text as in what's displayed on the browser
[2013-05-03 14:48:44] Dude-X: looking at an html element's attributes can be verified too
[2013-05-03 14:49:10] dross: Dude-X: width?
[2013-05-03 14:49:33] Dude-X: <div class='center'> : d.find_element_by_class('center').get_attribute("class") will extract center
[2013-05-03 14:50:18] dross: Dude-X: but what if some named a side bar id="content"? (looking for id="content")
[2013-05-03 14:50:55] Dude-X: d.find_element_by_css_selector("div#content") will give you the web element node
[2013-05-03 14:51:14] Dude-X: or throw an exception if it can't find it
[2013-05-03 14:51:29] Dude-X: if you're writing tests, your tests should be deterministic though
[2013-05-03 14:53:34] dross: hmm, that may work
[2013-05-03 14:54:09] dross: this extractor we have keeps extracting the WRONG content, someone wrote it to extract text from the largest content block =)
[2013-05-03 14:54:38] Dude-X: selenium will be slow if you're not testing the UI
[2013-05-03 14:54:40] dross: by largest, I mean the content inside the node. So on some pages we end up getting the wrong content which is really in the center of the page
[2013-05-03 14:54:54] Dude-X: yeah they just need better selectors it sounds like
[2013-05-03 14:55:31] dross: Dude-X: using selenium period or with a specific browser?
[2013-05-03 14:56:24] dross: I'm looking to use a chrome or webkit driver, not sure what the speeds are. Though I know we process quite a few articles a second :)
[2013-05-03 14:56:42] Dude-X: well selenium is "slow" in general, so if you're testing the browser, make sure you're testing the browser and not content that can be tested with a raw XML/HTML library
[2013-05-03 14:57:43] dross: Dude-X: we already are using an XML/HTML library, the point would be to pseudo render the page to get the content block size and location
[2013-05-03 14:58:06] dross: the goal is to eliminate incorrect extraction errors
[2013-05-03 14:58:06] Dude-X: ah
[2013-05-03 14:58:29] Dude-X: yeah selenium may be suitable for that
[2013-05-03 14:58:51] Dude-X: if the divs the layout is correct for the containers
[2013-05-03 14:58:53] dross: I was looking to write a JNI to webkit, but then ran across a selenium webkit driver on github :)
[2013-05-03 14:59:14] Dude-X: there is phantomJS that lets you do headless testing
[2013-05-03 14:59:23] Dude-X: otherwise web driver is fine with Chrome
[2013-05-03 14:59:29] dross: so I thought, "Okay, this is sort of offlabel use but I'll investigate"
[2013-05-03 14:59:33] dross: hmm
[2013-05-03 15:00:14] Dude-X: i suppose you can query the css property of an element
[2013-05-03 15:00:40] Dude-X: with a given web element, you can query it's size in pixels
[2013-05-03 15:00:50] Dude-X: and also query it's css properties
[2013-05-03 15:01:00] dross: Dude-X: do you know if phantom or selenium is faster?
[2013-05-03 15:01:22] Dude-X: they both use the same API
[2013-05-03 15:01:38] Dude-X: phantom would be faster since it's not spending cycles on rendering the display
[2013-05-03 15:01:44] dross: Dude-X: yeah, that's the purpose was for the CSS extraction too. I looked at CSS libraries but none give leeway for crappy css code
[2013-05-03 15:02:32] Dude-X: both phantomJS and webdriver let you execute arbitrary javascript
[2013-05-03 15:02:47] dross: hmmm
[2013-05-03 15:02:48] Dude-X: so you can query the computed css properties of a web element

[2013-05-03 15:03:57] Dude-X: but you can't get any screenshots though i think
