[2013-10-17 01:16:20] son: My geb chromeTest task runs fine in Windows
[2013-10-17 01:16:45] son: but in Jenkins it's been failing

[2013-10-17 01:17:06] son: sorry I don't how to copy past the stacktrace nicely
[2013-10-17 01:17:17] son: eghm: ^^
[2013-10-17 01:18:02] son: I've tried to upgrade to latest version of geb and spock core but it doesn't help
[2013-10-17 01:18:41] brian_hutton: son: Are you using a remote driver?
[2013-10-17 01:19:12] son: this I don't know
[2013-10-17 01:19:32] son: pretty much in terms of the config, I copy-paste the config from geb-gradle project
[2013-10-17 01:19:41] son: how can I check it?
[2013-10-17 01:20:03] brian_hutton: Common cause for that is either you´re trying to reach an inexistant remote driver or the browser got closed at certain point in your test, so it's unreachable
[2013-10-17 01:21:47] brian_hutton: Check where you're creating your driver. IF youäre creating a Remote Driver, check the parameters. Else, try and see if an exception or something is closingthe driver mid test. That's all I cna tell you, I have no idea what geb-gradle project is or how it's configured. Sorry
[2013-10-17 01:23:00] son: Thank you

[2013-10-17 05:37:26] wsandin: hello.. when using selenium with Xvfb.. do I need to write a start-up script to start a Xvfb display each and everytime the machine starts?
[2013-10-17 05:38:15] andreastt: Presumably you can change the browser binary location to prepend xvfb-run.
[2013-10-17 05:38:34] wsandin: you mean.. like a Firefox wrapper?
[2013-10-17 05:38:34] andreastt: That wraps your process in a xvfb for the duration of the process lifetime.
[2013-10-17 05:38:56] andreastt: Yes so like xvfb-run firefox -your -arguments -here.
[2013-10-17 05:39:34] andreastt: That would save you from having to start and keep one xvfb session alive from you boot the machine.
[2013-10-17 05:40:59] andreastt: In Python I think it's common to use something like https://github.com/cgoldberg/xvfbwrapper.
[2013-10-17 05:41:15] andreastt: Quite possibly you could do something similar for your language of choice.

[2013-10-17 09:30:46] Dude-X: i think the real victims of intrusive government spying is not the regular people who go on about their daily lives but the small or large businesses that are a threat to the older, established corporations who have their toehold in the government
[2013-10-17 09:31:30] Dude-X: although in light of the fact that the NSA shares stuff with the DEA, people who take drugs may also be ensnared.

[2013-10-17 09:34:16] dimacus: jbut also think of how many blue prints etc Chinese government has stolen and passed down to their manufacturers
[2013-10-17 09:34:32] p_l: Dude-X: that's part of what Gen. Alexander lied about in his talk in Congress - there are at least two known cases of NSA being party to industrial espionage, back when the programs in question were called "ECHELON" :P

[2013-10-17 09:36:16] dimacus: once they lost contract you give it to your buddies with a nice kick back… and a bonus for some extra blue prints
[2013-10-17 09:36:33] p_l: dimacus: that's what NSA does, in fact.
[2013-10-17 09:37:38] p_l: China, afaik, steals the blueprints but doesn't torpedo the companies they steal them from (majority of stealing seems to be for internal use, the rest is simply "just don't add the logo, we make it anyway")
[2013-10-17 09:37:52] dimacus: i think we been talking too much politics here in last couple of weeks… expect a drone to show up on your door step within an hhour
[2013-10-17 09:38:23] p_l: dimacus: ... you just had to remind me that one of the more common drone designs in UK was stolen by BAe from my family, eh? ;P

[2013-10-17 09:38:52] dimacus: p_l:  huh?
[2013-10-17 09:39:13] p_l: Dude-X: because military drones are nothing new, they count as remotely guided planes anyway
[2013-10-17 09:39:13] Dude-X: yeah
[2013-10-17 09:39:19] Dude-X: military drones are bad too

[2013-10-17 09:39:34] Dude-X: making new terrorists every time they bomb a village
[2013-10-17 09:39:59] p_l: Dude-X: drones aren't bad, their use is. Drones don't do anything *new*, they are just cheaper to send than F-15E or F-16 with orders to bomb the same village
[2013-10-17 09:40:28] dimacus: Dude-X:  that's what i completely agree with… we appear as the Death Star to them… in their eyes they are all luke skywalkers...
[2013-10-17 09:40:44] p_l: it's essentially the same act, it's just that hour of flight of F-15E will cost you several times what is the cost of a hour of drone flight
[2013-10-17 09:41:03] Dude-X: well the US is an empire...
[2013-10-17 09:41:03] Dude-X: but the day we drop the pretense and act as bad as a hollywood movie
[2013-10-17 09:42:08] p_l: Dude-X: might actually be welcomed. It seems to me that dealing with honestly bad govt is easier and more profitable than dealing with covertly bad
[2013-10-17 09:42:27] Dude-X: that's good

[2013-10-17 12:28:04] ranju: Hi, I'm new to selenium, and I just built and ran my first project. What I'm trying to figure out is how to supress all the DEBUG logging statements that appear in the console. I googled around extensively, and it seems like many people have the problem, but none of the suggested solutions work...
[2013-10-17 12:28:41] ranju: any help would be greatly appreciated!
[2013-10-17 12:29:05] jarib: ranju: :clarify
[2013-10-17 12:29:05] selbot2: Please clarify: Are you using WebDriver, RC or IDE? What version of Selenium? What programming language? What browser and browser version? What operating system?
[2013-10-17 12:29:16] jarib: not sure what console you're talking about.
[2013-10-17 12:29:33] jleyba: lukeis: That's more a question for kkania I think
[2013-10-17 12:29:36] ranju: Sorry, I'm using WebDriver in Java

[2013-10-17 14:01:13] nirvdrum: But I still think it'd be a support problem because Apple defaults to installing Java 6 the first time you type "java" in a console.

[2013-10-17 14:33:12] lukeis: jimevans: my fix is to remove "-lxul" from the linker command
[2013-10-17 14:33:40] jimevans: if we don't need libxul, we shouldn't be linking to it, but i'm pretty sure we do.
[2013-10-17 14:33:52] lukeis: yeah, that's why i'm unsure about it

[2013-10-17 16:03:06] jarib: lukeis: looks like you fixed it?
[2013-10-17 16:03:49] lukeis: fixed what? :)
[2013-10-17 16:04:04] jarib: the FF24 native events issue?
[2013-10-17 16:04:10] lukeis: not yet
[2013-10-17 16:04:31] lukeis: it passes in CI for reasons unknown
[2013-10-17 16:04:38] jarib: oh, hm
[2013-10-17 16:04:39] lukeis: failure is the same as the one for FF23
[2013-10-17 16:04:42] lukeis: in ci
[2013-10-17 16:05:36] jarib: ok, i'll probably postpone the ruby release until tomorrow then, it's getting late here
[2013-10-17 16:06:57] lukeis: good idea
[2013-10-17 16:07:07] lukeis: just pushed a 'hope and pray' fix...
[2013-10-17 16:07:26] lukeis: this will likely get reverted if things go to shit ;)
[2013-10-17 16:07:42] lukeis: but it's time for me to head home too

[2013-10-17 16:30:49] jarib: greatflamingfoo: that's right, you need to use the FirefoxProfile class (or your language's equivalent)

[2013-10-17 16:37:41] greatflamingfoo: My language is perl and it doesn't have that class. It does everything via the remote driver as far as I can tell.
[2013-10-17 16:38:11] greatflamingfoo: Does that mean I just out of luck on downloading files?
[2013-10-17 16:42:50] jarib: not necessarily. you can pass a zipped and base64-encoded profile as a capability to the remote driver
[2013-10-17 16:45:03] jarib: that's not intended to be user-facing, which is why other bindings has a FirefoxProfile class
[2013-10-17 16:45:23] greatflamingfoo: Is there some documentation on that somewhere? I don't see anything like that in the Capabilities JSON Object
[2013-10-17 16:45:24] jarib: what are you using the custom profile for?

[2013-10-17 16:46:26] jarib: right
[2013-10-17 16:47:28] greatflamingfoo: Ok, I can do that. Do you happen to know which class I should start looking at?

[2013-10-17 16:58:34] jarib: greatflamingfoo: that would be FirefoxProfile.toJson()
[2013-10-17 16:58:43] jarib: you want to pass the result of that as a capability named "firefox_profile"
[2013-10-17 17:00:21] greatflamingfoo: Thanks
[2013-10-17 17:01:10] jarib: greatflamingfoo: oh, there is another way as well
[2013-10-17 17:01:13] jarib: you can use a named profile
[2013-10-17 17:02:24] jarib: so if you launch firefox with `firefox -ProfileManager`, and manually install the profile and name it e.g. "CustomizedWebDriver" (you should avoid naming it "WebDriver" iirc)
[2013-10-17 17:02:24] noahsussman, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
