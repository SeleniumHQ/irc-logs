[04:36:14] indec: Evening all. Anyone around who has set up chromedriver to work with the perl CPAN modules?
[04:37:12] indec: I downloaded and started chromedriver on my local machine, but WWW::Selenium and Selenium::Remote::Driver refuse to talk to it....
[04:37:42] intchanter: Are you running the Selenium server?
[04:37:52] intchanter: With the options to enable the Chrome driver?
[04:38:13] indec: I've possibly made a schoolboy error here, haven't I?
[04:38:20] stephend has joined #selenium
[04:38:29] indec: When I read the docs it sounded like chromedriver was standalone.
[04:38:43] intchanter: I'm not positive.  I'm actually checking the docs as we speak.
[04:39:24] indec: Much obliged
[04:42:02] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[04:43:20] intchanter: So most of the documentation uses the Java bindings, which can play by different rules.
[04:43:52] intchanter: Specifically, I know that the Perl bindings don't automatically handle starting up the server.
[04:43:52] indec: Yeah. When I start chromedriver there's an HTTP server there but it 403s.
[04:44:17] intchanter: So it's the language bindings for Perl that aren't so stand-alone.
[04:44:32] intchanter: Are you running it from the console?
[04:44:51] intchanter: If so, its output could be helpful.
[04:44:54] intchanter: :paste
[04:44:57] intchanter: :pastebin
[04:45:12] intchanter: Ah, what was that tag?
[04:45:34] intchanter: Anyway, use a paste service and drop the link here and I'll help look at the output.
[04:46:23] indec: There's not much to look at: http://pastebin.com/9R8QZtBZ
[04:46:41] indec: The log file is just
[04:46:42] indec: 0.000][INFO]:      ChromeDriver 26.0.1383.0 /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
[04:48:01] intchanter: Do you have the selenium server .jar file running?
[04:48:41] intchanter: IIUC, that should be firing up chromedriver if it gets a request to connect to a Chrome browser.
[04:49:11] intchanter: I don't have everything set up here at home or I'd be able to give more definite answers.
[04:53:36] intchanter: http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.31.0.jar is the file I'd try.
[04:53:48] indec: Yeah, just getting Java wrangled.

[04:55:21] soonick: Does anyone know where I can get the development version of selenium ide?
[04:56:21] intchanter: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/ has a link for it.
[04:56:46] xiaoli has joined #selenium
[04:58:06] soonick: Thanks intchanter. I can just decompress it and work over it, right?
[04:59:37] intchanter: You'd only decompress it if you want to make changes to it.  If you just want to use it, install the .xpi into Firefox.
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Mar  6 05:00:13 2013]
[05:00:13] intchanter: Or if you want to see what's in it I guess, but then you're better off cloning the repo and reading the source that goes into it.
[05:00:38] soonick: I want to make changes to it. I guess it would be better to get the repo. Can you point me to where I can get it?
[05:01:32] intchanter: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/ or https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium
[05:02:00] intchanter: I recommend starting the clone and going to bed.  It can take a while.
[05:04:58] indec: intchanter: Yay! Got it working.
[05:05:22] intchanter: Awesome!  Did it take more than we talked about?
[05:05:34] soonick: The IDE is in the ide folder?
[05:05:39] indec: If I specify the path to chromedriver when starting the server .jar and I specify in Selenium::Remote::Driver that I'm using the server as a proxy then it seems to work.
[05:06:54] intchanter: Odd.  It should be using the default port to connect on.
[05:07:02] intchanter: soonick: Yes, that sounds right.

[12:07:27] xiaoli_ has joined #selenium
[12:18:32] AutomatedTester: intchanter: craigds stuff?
[12:27:29] arex\: Solved it. It was a Javascript that restricted which characters you could use in the field based on the browser language.
[12:28:23] arex\: Although my Grid Node is on the same network as me, it takes 5-30 seconds from I start a single unit test until the Grid node reacts. What could cause something like this?
[12:31:29] arex\: The test is just this.driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri(aUrl), DesiredCapabilities.Chrome()); this.driver.Navigate().GoToUrl(someUrl);

[15:49:36] jpadilla: Hey guys quick question, I'm using python + selenium to run Django tests. I'm having trouble focusing on a textarea in Firefox. Focusing on that element will show other elements so the test can continue. I've tried focusing with execute_script and jQuery but no luck. Just upgraded to the latest 2.31 selenium but  still having the issue.

[16:21:33] AutomatedTester: intchanter: yes
[16:21:52] AutomatedTester: intchanter: it creates a virtualenv with that version
[16:21:53] intchanter-work: Okay, I'd probably call it python= tehn.
[16:22:00] intchanter-work: Oh...
[16:22:16] AutomatedTester: we already build our own virtualenv during the build process
[16:22:41] intchanter-work: Okay, cool.  Then specifying the executable will only pull the version, and not an existing virtualenv.

[16:31:29] akhet: ive never encountered a site such as this ...there is no way to reference any link which extends beyond root the uri's all seem to be randomly generated after clicking an element and so far not reproducable
[16:32:06] cgoldberg: akhet, do you have an actual question?  sorry, but "my app sucks, how do i automate it?" is a question that is just gonna get you: "RTFM" comments.
[16:32:47] akhet: uri's with all caps generating random uri's where can i RTFM about it ? :)
[16:34:07] cgoldberg: akhet, all caps is no problem.. do you think selenium can't handle capital letters or something? :)   ... andd what does "generating random uri's" actually mean?
[16:34:11] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: With that change, will the CI system be easily able to build and test with at least one 2.x version and one 3.x version?
[16:35:24] llaskin1: cgoldberg: Canonical is next
[16:35:41] llaskin1: no more telecommute for you
[16:35:43] cgoldberg: intchanter-work, AutomatedTester,  have you guys used tox for testing across python versions?  it's a really nice tool
[16:35:54] llaskin1: (btw, I thought it was a stupid fricking idea when yahoo announced it just as this article points out)
[16:36:37] AutomatedTester: intchanter-work: yes
[16:37:02] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: I might do that next
[16:37:02] intchanter-work: cgoldberg: It looks interesting, but I haven't tried it yet.
[16:37:31] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: also, since we're on github, see if we can get some travis-ci love
[16:37:34] akhet: cgoldberg: ok, so this is a stickball stats site, a common operation would be to go to the root url of the site ... scorebook.com/stickball click on a teams name then click on a players name to get that players stats.  But if you were to try to share this link with another person it would come up 404 and lead  you to the docroot of  scorebook.com  again
[16:37:58] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, intchanter-work ... let me know if you need any help with tox (there is also detox, which runs tox in parallel).. but it's fantastic for setting up virtualenvs and testing across interpreter versions
[16:38:15] AutomatedTester: cgoldberg: will do
[16:38:20] cgoldberg: AutomatedTester, yea i really like travis-ci.  it's config is similar to tox
[16:40:07] akhet: so the referenced elements of the original interaction it seems like the second you are done with your operation ...sorry ...trying my best to phrase this correctly, doesnt seem like im doing a very good job
[16:41:03] akhet: the referenced elements are *lost* of the original interaction are lost once you are done with your operation *
[16:41:11] intchanter-work: cgoldberg: Would travis-ci and tox together be redundant to some extent?
[16:41:38] intchanter-work: Or would tox allow better testing by developers before pushing changes to be run on travis?
[16:42:03] cgoldberg: intchanter-work, umm sorta, but not totally... I use both.  I use tox locally when developing.. then let travis-ci take care of testing again after I push
[16:42:26] akhet: continuing to use firebug to try to figure out what is going on here....again i apologize for the lack of clarity in my question
[16:43:08] cgoldberg: intchanter-work, travis-ci is almost like "hosted tox" in my mind
[16:43:56] intchanter-work: I like analogies that help me fit things together.  Thanks.  :-)

[18:38:34] simonstewart: Almost definitely
[18:38:41] simonstewart: Is it worth looking at the clean_slate branch?
[18:39:24] jarib: not really

[18:44:19] jimevans: just out of curiosity, what are we accomplishing with the jruby update? just bringing us up to date, or something more fundamental?
[18:44:21] jarib: tim13o: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/
[18:44:39] lukeis: tim13o: this link ^
[18:45:33] jarib: jimevans: bringing us up to date for one, also if i'm not mistaken the latest jruby performs much better on java 7 (invokedynamic and all that)
[18:45:45] jarib: not sure if that affects our build, but it shouldn't hurt
[18:46:01] jimevans: that's fair. like i said, just curious.
[18:46:20] jarib: nirvdrum knows this better than i
[18:46:49] jarib: though, if simonstewart's java build is getting closer, perhaps it's not worth the hassle
[18:47:00] simonstewart: It's worth the hassle
[18:47:03] jarib: lol
[18:47:20] simonstewart: I've been a bit distracted by work.
[18:47:38] simonstewart: But if anyone wants to get the new_world branch working properly with our build I'll give 'em commit rights
[18:48:10] nirvdrum: invokedynamic is disabled in JRuby 1.7 unless on a JDK 8 build.  So we don't gain that.  JRuby 1.7 itself is a fair bit faster though.
[18:48:18] jarib: oh
[18:48:22] tim13o: thanks jarib + lukeis
[18:48:23] nirvdrum: And it has much better process execution support, which we use rather heavily.
[18:49:13] jarib: :seen eranm 
[18:49:13] selbot2: eranm was last seen 7 days ago, saying ':log'.
[18:49:30] nirvdrum: invokedynamic will be enabled with JDK 7u16 (due out in April), as that has some necessary performance fixes.  But I'm not sure it buys us much since indy is a steady-state optimization.  You see little gain in start up or infrequently used methods.
[18:50:08] nirvdrum: 1.7 is also the only maintained branch and is where security fixes land.  Better Windows support too, IIRC.
[18:50:39] simonstewart: The FileWatcher stuff is new hotness too

[20:04:12] simonstewart: I'm about >< this close to replacing all "-" in build target names with "_"
[20:04:22] adamgoucher: so if i had <div id="foo"><a href="httpâ€¦">stoopid anchors"</a></div> -- how would i say to click on portion of the div that is styled to be larger than the contained anchor?
[20:04:29] simonstewart: "//third-party/java/guava_libraries"  is driving me slowly mad
[20:04:41] simonstewart: Wat?
[20:04:59] llaskin1: adamgoucher: you can't get_style out of the element?
[20:05:55] simonstewart: short answer: use the advanced user interactions API
[20:06:02] adamgoucher: say the achor takes up 60% of the div by space, and is centered. when i click on the div, the anchor will get the click and be followed. i want to click somwhere on the 40%
[20:06:11] simonstewart: And call get_location and get_size on the link and the div to calculate where to click
[20:06:12] simonstewart: simples
[20:06:20] adamgoucher: ya â€¦ i thought that might be the trick.
[20:07:06] simonstewart: "click" just aims for about the centre in the common case

[20:34:20] simonstewart: jarib: main point: if github fund selenium development to the extent that google does I might consider it

[20:34:29] simonstewart: so I won't
[20:34:49] simonstewart: Also, I'm starting to really not enjoy git. I'd like to be able to switch to hg at some point
[20:36:24] jarib: right, if google actually cares about where it's hosted, that's a good reason
[20:36:30] jarib: what are you not enjoying about git?

[20:58:08] jschwepp: Hello.  I'm trying to adapt a python scipt that works using the Firefox driver to use the HTMLUnit driver so I can run the script on my server. So I changed self.driver = webdriver.Firefox() to  self.driver = webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:4443/wd/hub", webdriver.DesiredCapabilities.HTMLUNITWITHJS)  but when I execute the script I get an error Unable to locate element with ID: 
[20:58:08] jschwepp: ctl00_cphBody_ddlSearch which is in reference to Select(driver.find_element_by_id("ctl00_cphBody_ddlSearch")).select_by_visible_text("Distributor Name").  So I checked the page with Firebug and this is the element: <select id="ctl00_cphBody_ddlSearch" onchange="javascript:setTimeout('__doPostBack(\'ctl00$cphBody$ddlSearch\',\'\')', 0)" name="ctl00$cphBody$ddlSearch">  Which the id is indeed 
[20:58:08] jschwepp: "ctl00_cphBody_ddlSearch".  What would cause Firefox to see the element but HTMLUnit to insist that it doesn't exist?

[21:39:13] simonstewart: It's hard to come up with good names :)
[21:40:23] barancev: jimevans: you're right, absolutely. but people ask question this style -- "how to open new tab?" -- "you should not do this" - "ok, I know, but how to open it anyway?" - "try this, may be you'll be able to open it, but you'll not be able to control it" - "excelent! it works! well... now... how to switch to another tab?"

[22:29:03] nirvdrum: Heh.
[22:29:34] nirvdrum: I was surprised you were willing to fly all the way across the country for another conference.
[22:30:34] jarib: well, when you've already crossed the atlantic, might as well look around a bit 
[22:30:53] nirvdrum: NYC isn't bad.  It's about 4 hours from Boston.
[22:31:04] nirvdrum: Maybe a bit longer on the train.
[22:31:58] nirvdrum: Let me know how it goes.  I've never done a regional conference like that, but some of them are bigger than the real conferences now.
[22:32:07] nirvdrum: I've given up on RailsConf and RubyConf completely :-(
[22:32:40] jimevans: right. gotta go. back maybe in a few hours.
[22:32:41] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:33:12] jarib: nirvdrum: what do you mean by regional vs real? not familiar with that distinction
[22:33:21] AutomatedTester: anyone know how I can squash a merge locally but retain the person who did the work
[22:33:30] jarib: you mean goruco is mostly locals?
[22:33:52] nirvdrum: Well, RubyConf is the official ruby conference and it moves around every year.
[22:33:54] jarib: AutomatedTester: ask them to do it
[22:34:13] nirvdrum: goruco is always in NYC and started as a conference for people in that area. But it's gotten much bigger than that.
[22:34:15] AutomatedTester: jarib: man.. was hoping you wouldnt say that...
[22:34:19] jarib: right
[22:34:27] AutomatedTester: sod it, will add there name to commit
[22:34:38] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: There's a way to set the author when you commit.
[22:34:51] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: oh...
[22:34:53] jarib: AutomatedTester: why not? if you care about a clean history, let the contributors know
[22:35:07] nirvdrum: I think it's: git commit --author
[22:35:13] AutomatedTester: jarib: they did 90% of the work and I cleaned it up
[22:35:33] AutomatedTester: but the PR doesnt work properly
[22:35:40] AutomatedTester: the 10% clean up makes it work
[22:35:43] lukeis: AutomatedTester: if you're squashing into their commit, it'll keep their name
[22:36:08] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Yeah, it's --author with the "Real Name <email>" format.
[22:36:14] lukeis: but yes, you can --amend --author
[22:36:22] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: thanks mate!
[22:36:54] nirvdrum: No problem.
[22:37:34] AutomatedTester: there are minor things broken but we support Python 2.6+ and 3.1+
[22:38:46] *lukeis is looking forward to installing py3 on one of my machines to try it out...
[22:38:54] lukeis: but i think i'll leave my mac on 2.7 ;)
[22:39:05] AutomatedTester: lukeis: you can have them side by side
[22:39:17] *AutomatedTester has 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 locally
[22:39:20] lukeis: sounds dangerous ;)
[22:39:24] AutomatedTester: virtuanenvs ftw
[22:39:31] AutomatedTester: its perfectly normal
[22:39:41] lukeis: is still a recreational pythonista
[22:39:58] lukeis: so i don't use virtual envs by default
[22:40:20] lukeis: there is nothing about iOS nor Android that lends one to python development ;)
[22:40:21] AutomatedTester: you need to do that
[22:40:45] AutomatedTester: virtualenvs mean your site-packages dont get crufty
[22:40:59] lukeis: i like cruft ;)
[22:41:33] lukeis: i haven't had an issue (yet) if / when i do, i'll likely take your advice
[22:42:03] AutomatedTester: few people take my python advice and then moan when what I warned them against bites them
[22:42:12] lukeis: hehe
[22:42:22] AutomatedTester: intchanter: Dude-X_: cgoldberg: Python 3 support is almost ready to land
[22:42:30] *lukeis promises not to moan too loudly
[22:42:56] *lukeis will not be doing the 2.32 release for python ;)
[22:43:12] AutomatedTester: no... that will be my baby
[22:43:18] lukeis: yes, yes it should be
[22:43:30] AutomatedTester: since the Py3 will probably cause a lot of moaning
[22:43:36] lukeis: speaking of babies, hope everything is going well :)
[22:43:44] AutomatedTester: oh yea

[22:44:01] AutomatedTester: The Youngest is starting to stretch out times between feeds
[22:44:09] lukeis: nice
[22:44:14] AutomatedTester: so getting up to 3 1/2 hr stints through the night
[22:44:32] *lukeis has enjoyed the last 2 weeks of sleeping completely through the night ;)
[22:44:41] AutomatedTester: wow...
[22:44:58] lukeis: 1yr3months now
[22:45:13] lukeis: (and not to mention the 3 yr old)
[22:45:22] AutomatedTester: If The Youngest goes like The Boy then we are about ~10 weeks away from 6 hr stints
[22:45:34] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[22:45:38] AutomatedTester: The Boy from about 8 months sleeps 12 hrs through the night
[22:45:46] AutomatedTester: he is 2 1/2
[22:46:04] lukeis: lucky. first one didn't do that till she was just over a year
[22:46:26] lukeis: second has always done long stretches, finally at 7pm - 7am 
[22:46:48] *lukeis had a heck of a time with the first
[22:47:09] AutomatedTester: The Boy has started doing 7pm - 7am but that used to be 7pm - 8am
[22:47:33] AutomatedTester: WFH is nice when you wake when you want to (read when the kids wake up)
[22:48:01] lukeis: i used to not have to set an alarm (mine is at 6:30 now)
[22:50:17] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Hoping to get a new video this year? :-P
[22:50:33] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: maybe...
[22:50:38] lukeis: i did get a very nice present though from the kids on sunday, everyone slept till 7:45â€¦ i can't remember the last time i 'slept in' that late
[22:50:43] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: will make sure my hair looks good..
[22:50:48] nirvdrum: I found it funny we've reused that one for two years now.
[22:50:52] nirvdrum: You do look a fair bit different.
[22:51:07] lukeis: i think it's awesome ;)
[22:51:20] AutomatedTester: yea, chunky monkey to normal
[22:51:40] nirvdrum: Jim, sadly, still has no hair :-P
[22:52:26] simonstewart: The Boy wakes up at least twice a night
[22:52:32] simonstewart: Normally around 3am
[22:53:08] lukeis: hopefully quick to go back down?
[22:53:17] nirvdrum: I like how none of you trust each other enough to use your children's real names.
[22:53:32] lukeis: we trust each otherâ€¦ just not the other 100 lurkers ;)
[22:53:40] nirvdrum: Heh.
[22:56:41] jarib: can't remember the last time you slept until 7:45?! you guys are making me so not want to have kids :)
[22:56:52] jarib: parents need to start talking more about the upsides

[23:04:58] simonstewart: And I'm teaching him to say "hello world"
[23:05:02] simonstewart: That'll be fun

[23:08:21] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: what do you expect element location to return if the CSS moves the element to a position on the page?
[23:08:41] simonstewart: Three guesses, and the last two don't count
[23:08:54] AutomatedTester: right thats what I thought
[23:09:18] AutomatedTester: we dont report position properly with transforms...
[23:09:26] *AutomatedTester will fix
[23:10:19] simonstewart: It'd be a lot easier if they'd stop trying to move the web forward and left it where it was for a bit
[23:10:31] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: definitely
[23:10:48] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: CSS animations are also making webdriver sad
