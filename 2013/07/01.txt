[2013-07-01 08:12:14] jimevans: SunilJoshi: there aren't any perl language bindings provided directly by the selenium project for webdriver. as such, i'd be surprised if IDE supported exporting to perl for webdriver. you'll need first to look for a third-party binding, then you'd need to create an IDE plugin to support those bindings.
[2013-07-01 08:12:35] jimevans: but, then again, i don't touch IDE. ever. so i may not know what i'm talking about.

[2013-07-01 11:19:20] santiycr: well, sorry for the waste of time
[2013-07-01 11:19:36] santiycr: I knew our system wasn't gonna be able to handle this jsonwp change when I read the email thread
[2013-07-01 11:19:41] santiycr: then I forgot :)
[2013-07-01 11:20:19] santiycr: FYI, our system will keep returning 303 to users for some time even if selenium is doing 200
[2013-07-01 11:20:39] jleyba: santiycr: that's fine.  I haven't changed any of the clients
[2013-07-01 11:20:41] santiycr: I want to make sure all the bindings out there are ready for this change before I move to it
[2013-07-01 11:21:09] jleyba: Figured we'd leave the client bindings alone for a few releases
[2013-07-01 11:21:13] santiycr: jleyba: also, thanks for pushing this forward. It's definitely a win for Sauce :)
[2013-07-01 11:21:42] jleyba: All of the official bindings handle the redirect transparently, so they should "just work" if the redirect detection were removed
[2013-07-01 11:21:45] santiycr: jleyba: my guess is we'll have to leave the client bindings alone for quite some time
[2013-07-01 11:22:08] jleyba: Yeah.  I'd like to update them before 3.0, but there's no immediate rush
[2013-07-01 11:22:15] santiycr: jleyba: well, there are a lot of unofficial bindings out there
[2013-07-01 11:22:26] santiycr: people have even hacked their own stripped out version
[2013-07-01 11:22:44] jleyba: I know.  There are some horrifying implementations out there
[2013-07-01 11:22:48] santiycr: so I'll wait for those to get bit when using Se locally :)
[2013-07-01 11:22:58] santiycr: then I'll move sauce to it
[2013-07-01 11:23:19] santiycr: jleyba: awesome. I'll probably wait a few weeks. A month tops
