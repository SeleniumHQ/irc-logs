[12:52:56] One-Man-Bucket: text always end up in the first contenteditable (using findElements(by.xpath(//path-to-second-contenteditable)).sendKeys("text in second contenteditable")
[12:53:27] One-Man-Bucket: if i use getText() with the same element i get correct text (from second contenteditable)
[12:53:42] One-Man-Bucket: this is selenium2.30.0 and firefox 18
[12:57:34] Ardesco: sounds like a locator problem
[12:57:39] Ardesco: can you show code and the html?
[12:57:45] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[12:58:32] One-Man-Bucket: hmm it would take some time to do that
[12:58:46] One-Man-Bucket: the locator is //child::*[(self::h1 or self::a) and text()='head_testBasicEditing']/ancestor-or-self::div/div/div/p
[12:59:53] One-Man-Bucket: but it works for clear() and getText(). sendKeys ends up writing in the element identified by the "//child::*[(self::h1 or self::a) and text()='head_testBasicEditing']" part of the locator

[13:18:41] barancev: can you enter in the "first contenteditable"? only second one is resistant?

[13:18:55] barancev: ?
[13:19:33] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: n osorry, the test is testing our cms which i'm running locally on my laptop behind company firewall
[13:19:45] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: and yeah, i can enter in the first contenteditable
[13:20:09] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: the second one works for clear() and getText() but sendKeys goes to the wrong contenteditable

[13:46:24] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: i think i'm on to something, in our test we first focus the first contenteditable, we use an action (to hover the mouse wehre we click) when doing this. after that i end up in the broken state
[13:46:58] One-Man-Bucket: barancev: i get the same behaviour in my minimal test case if i stop the exection before click  &settext and manually focus the first contenteditable in the browser
[13:47:01] One-Man-Bucket: then resume execution
[13:47:19] Ardesco: is there an additional class being applied to the element on hover
[13:47:25] Ardesco: which breaks the locator
[13:49:48] One-Man-Bucket: Ardesco: not in this case no. besides, the locator works for gettext, so..
[13:50:32] Ardesco: bleh
[13:50:39] Ardesco: not going to be able to offer much insight them tbh
[13:50:56] One-Man-Bucket: Ardesco: no worries, thanks anyway :) i'll soon have a gist to post
[13:50:56] Ardesco: the locator you pasted is complex enough that we would really need to see the html

[14:40:10] jimevans: it's the kind of thing i'd personally like to see more of in the OSS community.

[15:29:11] Kunal_: How does selnium commiter decide on what versions of browsers to support? For instance, I am specifically looking for Chrome and Firefox
[15:31:06] testingb0t: nice, there's an experimental chromedriver2 available for download http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list
[15:31:42] jimevans: Kunal_: generally, for firefox, it's defined as: at the time of release of the selenium library, current version of firefox, immediately previous version of firefox, current extended support release (ESR) version of firefox, and immediately previous esr version of firefox. 
[15:32:24] jimevans: for chrome, it's determined by the chromium team, and is decided by the version of chromedriver.exe you are running.
[15:33:03] jimevans: but for chrome, usually, the latest release channel version is supported, since a user has to work really hard to be on a version other than the latest chrome release.

[17:06:42] lukeis: manoj: if you haven't already you should have a local clone of the 'site' repo, which you can edit locally and after you do, make a patch file: `git diff > patch.txt` and upload that file
[17:07:27] lukeis: or better yet, if you have the git clone, commit the changes and push it to a public repo somewhere (either google code or github) then comment in the issue with the location of that repo
[17:07:28] manoj: actually, i used the edit this page option in the seleniumHq site. You made it so simple. :)
[17:08:03] lukeis: that is nice for one-offs, but if you're planning on doing extensive changes you really should clone your own copy of the site and work from there

[17:54:51] jimevans: i had a change of one file i wanted to push. deps.js gets written to, and in the past, i could just discard the written changes by 'git checkout'. that doesn't work anymore and i want to know why.
[17:55:23] lukeis: because the repo says line endings need to be one way and your OS is putting them another way
[17:55:44] lukeis: and locally you still have the setting that says files get to be what the OS decides
[17:55:54] lukeis: but that's different than the repo ;)
[17:55:59] lukeis: so, always diff
[17:56:17] lukeis: until you commit and pull the latest that has a different repo setting

[18:11:25] intchanter-work: Good to know.
[18:15:14] lukeis: intchanter-work: what dude-x said ;) github is an identical mirror of GC, we'll take pull requests from either

[18:16:57] manoj: thanks lukeis:
[18:17:12] manoj: i will make sure my patches henceforth will be done via that.
[18:17:36] manoj: but for this, i guess its ok to do a txt file and update it in comment ?
[18:18:55] lukeis: you canâ€¦ it's easier for me to pull your changes from another repo, but yes, i can apply a txt patch file too

[19:03:06] barancev: nirvdrum: can you write a technically correct comment?
[19:03:22] nirvdrum: He provided so little info that I can't even begin to answer.
[19:03:52] nirvdrum: The problem is Haw Bin had a version up on Sourceforge that was fairly broken.  He granted me permission to move it to GitHub where I fixed a lot of things.
[19:04:06] nirvdrum: But I didn't publish a compiled version because I was working on licensing matters.
[19:04:35] nirvdrum: And I needed to resolve an IDispatch naming disput in order to be compatible with the Se RC code.
[19:04:57] nirvdrum: So, long story short, this might not even be a bug anymore.  But I don't know what he's running so I can't say for sure.
[19:05:21] manoj: is there any criteria to get a commit bit access for selenium repo ?
[19:05:34] barancev: ok, I'll add a link to the snapsie issue, to track it

[19:06:10] nirvdrum: barancev: Sounds good.  I can do that and close it out if you'd like.
[19:06:12] manoj: how is it now ?
[19:06:50] barancev: nirvdrum: np, I've added the link, it's enough to track the progress
[19:07:12] nirvdrum: Thanks.
[19:10:01] barancev: manoj: first you create lots of patches and attach them to the issues (your own or created by somebody else) and push dev team members to apply your patches, and after some good credit history they tired of applying patches decide to give you a commit bit
[19:10:32] manoj: alright, got them. So still the same old way. Thanks.

[19:30:17] jimevans: nirvdrum: you're not misunderstanding the macros. the real reason is i'm just stupid. but the bottom line is that it really doesn't matter. there's nothing in the IE apis that we use that's IE7+ or Vista+ only.

[21:03:48] jleyba: What error is git giving you?
[21:04:08] jimevans: deps.js is perpetually "changed"
[21:04:19] jleyba: git update-index --assume-unchanged javascript/deps.js
[21:04:28] jleyba: that has been a life saver for me
[21:05:09] barancev: I've once got the same. only helper deleting the file and git checkout -- .
[21:05:21] jimevans: jleyba: thanks. that's helping
[21:05:28] jimevans: barancev: even that didn't work for me.
[21:05:28] jarib: i bet it's CRLF related
[21:05:34] jimevans: jarib: i'm quite sure it is.
[21:05:39] jleyba: jarib: No, the file gets auto generated by almost any of the js builds
[21:05:44] jimevans: but i don't know how to fix the damned thing
[21:06:02] barancev: yes, git diff shown no changes, but git status told the file changed
[21:06:06] jleyba: and the order of statements within the file don't seem to be stable across invocations, so you get lots of diffs
[21:06:22] barancev: there mustbe some setting to ignore CRLF differences
[21:06:25] lukeis: it is crlf related, i'm trying to figure out the best way to 'fix' itâ€¦ the assume-unchanged is a good work-around for now
[21:06:27] jleyba: I'm 90% sure we don't need to check it in, but I haven't sat down to check all the usages
[21:06:55] jarib: jleyba: if that was the only problem, you would be able to just do `git checkout javascript/deps.js` to revert it
[21:07:04] jarib: i think on windows it'll be generated with CRLFs

[21:09:09] jimevans: momma told me there'd be days like this.
[21:09:11] jarib: no no, just saying that's a CRLF change
[21:09:24] jarib: so apparently the file is being generated with CRLFs

[21:12:07] lukeis: yes
[21:12:20] jleyba: we used to need to manually generate javascript/deps.js
[21:12:34] jleyba: but it should be rigged to generate it as needed
[21:12:34] lukeis: i would just add 'pull dependencies' as another step after sync the project
[21:12:40] jimevans: also, hey, i can build and release the .NET bindings from a windows machine, which require linux binaries to be used as embedded resources.
[21:12:41] jleyba: so it we should be able to remove it from scm

[21:54:38] lukeis: flash == you're doing it wrong :D
[21:56:44] barancev: reading wikipedia:
[21:57:44] barancev: on January 5, 2011, Adobe Systems, Google Inc., and Mozilla Foundation finalized a new browser API (dubbed NPAPI ClearSiteData). This will allow browsers implementing the API to clear local shared objects.[12] Four months later, Adobe announced that Flash Player 10.3 enables Mozilla Firefox 4 and "future releases of Apple Safari and Google Chrome" to delete local shared objects,[11] so since versi
[21:58:03] barancev: so since version 4, Firefox treats LSOs the same way as HTTP cookies - deletion rules that previously applied only to HTTP cookies now also apply to LSOs
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Feb 25 22:00:00 2013]
[22:00:00] barancev: as for me -- I'd get rid of all cookie-management functions
[22:00:15] barancev: a user never do this directly
[22:00:29] barancev: she login/logout, stop/start the browser
[22:00:39] barancev: and never manage cookies directly
[22:01:07] intchanter-work: Depends on the user and what they're doing, really.
[22:01:14] barancev: especially it is important to HttpOnly cookies -- they are supposed to not be available
[22:01:41] jimevans: barancev: i hear you, but without them it makes it nearly impossible to test specific scenarios without going through the entire end-to-end workflow, which could be very very very slow.

[22:26:12] diminoten: I've got a philosophical question for you: how do you write unit tests for a selenium project?
[22:26:28] diminoten: without inherently relying on the site you're supposed to be testing as working?
[22:27:03] intchanter-work: The tests in the project itself use a small webserver to serve static files.
[22:27:08] intchanter-work: Those static files are part of the test.
[22:27:38] diminoten: I thought about that, but there are nontrivial aspects to the behavior of certain tasks being performed by the selenium project
[22:28:03] intchanter-work: That's probably why some of the tests are fairly involved.
[22:28:06] diminoten: that make static pages... difficult
[22:28:12] dude-x: diminoten: i have a "Test the framework tests" where it's basically the same script of a page but change the outcomes of true/false to the opposite
[22:28:26] dude-x: if something should be displayed, the opposite should throw an error
[22:28:32] diminoten: that makes sense
[22:29:59] diminoten: it's just *really* difficult to rely on selenium as a first line of testing against new builds
[22:30:00] qaguy has joined #selenium
[22:31:04] barancev: diminoten: what do you mean by "a selenium project"?
[22:32:31] diminoten: I usually build a separate set of libraries specifically for web-testing
[22:32:47] diminoten: and then the test project itself depends on the webtesting library
[22:33:14] diminoten: it helps differentiate between test failures and library failures
[22:34:00] barancev: and you need tests for the library. right. use mocks.
[22:34:01] diminoten: test failures being the test which exercise the functionality of the site, and library failures being failures of the testing library to successfully perform an action
[22:34:31] diminoten: would it be understandable if that weren't an opition?
[22:34:31] diminoten: *option
[22:34:59] diminoten: I can't think of a way to mock my site, is what I mean
[22:35:24] barancev: you can mock WebDriver and WebElement
[22:35:40] diminoten: how?
[22:35:43] barancev: they are interfaces
[22:35:51] diminoten: hm okay
[22:36:04] diminoten: yeah I guess that works
[22:36:05] barancev: that's ideal situation for any mocking library
[22:36:13] diminoten: I hadn't thought to do that
[22:36:41] diminoten: do you know of an example of this at all
[22:37:03] barancev: sure, some of selenium tests are mocked
[22:37:12] diminoten: ah fair point
