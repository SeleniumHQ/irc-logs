[00:18:59] KaibutsuX: AutomatedTester: yt?
[00:22:48] flyinprogramer: using ruby bindings; is there a way to know if any navigation change has occurred after executing some code; for example in the beginning of the test i'm on Page A, then i run some code, how do I know if the code hasn't caused a refresh to occur
[00:23:41] stackedsax1 has joined #selenium
[00:23:46] KaibutsuX: a refresh to the same page?
[00:23:59] KaibutsuX: I don't know if you can detect that, but you can use driver.current_url
[00:24:28] flyinprogramer: yah it'd be a refresh to the same page
[00:24:49] flyinprogramer: just trying to prove that my code is smart enough not to do a refresh, if that makes any sense...
[00:24:52] lukeis: flyinprogramer: you can find an element on the page initially, if you attempt to get the text or an attribute on that element after a refresh it will throw a stale reference exception
[00:25:21] flyinprogramer: lukeis: interesting 
[00:27:48] flyinprogramer: lukeis: smart cookie - i can work with that
[00:28:01] lukeis: :)
[00:30:25] KaibutsuX: lukeis: you ever used browsermobproxy?
[00:30:32] lukeis: nope
[00:30:39] lukeis: wellâ€¦ not really
[00:30:58] lukeis: i've run it, but never extracted a har
[00:32:19] KaibutsuX: im just trying to figure out how to get the java process to die after I'm done with it
[00:34:16] lukeis: kill kill kill die die die...
[00:34:54] evanton has joined #selenium
[00:35:35] flyinprogramer: KaibutsuX: kill -9 ?
[00:35:37] evanton: is this a good place to ask a question about selenium python bindings or should I go to python channel?
[00:36:02] flyinprogramer: evanton: this is general selenium, so its a fine place to ask
[00:36:18] *lukeis knows a thing or two about selenium python...
[00:36:33] flyinprogramer: KaibutsuX: i know a thing or two about browsermobproxy
[00:36:57] flyinprogramer: are you trying to kill a process you spin up on the fly, or is it a proxy you start manually ?
[00:37:05] KaibutsuX: I'm using AutomatedTester's Server python class
[00:37:11] KaibutsuX: I think it's a windows issue
[00:37:23] lukeis: there's your problemâ€¦ using windows ;)
[00:37:28] KaibutsuX: Server.start() calls subprocess.Popen('proxy.bat')
[00:37:38] KaibutsuX: and server.stop() calls process.kill()
[00:37:51] KaibutsuX: but the kill only kills a cmd.exe, not the child java.exe
[00:38:05] KaibutsuX: so after starting 4 drivers, I'm using 4 javas with 32mB of ram each
[00:38:06] flyinprogramer: yah, that seems like a poor implementation 
[00:38:12] evanton: so I have a WebElement instance which I found by iterating over things and looking at their attributes (since the HTML code is horrible and they don't have unique IDs). Now how do I find the previous element?
[00:38:22] KaibutsuX: I think it might be something with starting the bat file
[00:38:22] evanton: I am using the python bindings
[00:38:33] KaibutsuX: xpath
[00:38:49] KaibutsuX: ele.find_element_by_xpath('../')
[00:38:57] flyinprogramer: KaibutsuX: not sure how python keeps track of processes it starts, but it would seem process isn't point to the child process it forks
[00:39:12] evanton: bah, lack of xpath knowledge bites my back again 
[00:39:15] flyinprogramer: KaibutsuX: which you obviously know by now -- could you mod process to subprocess
[00:39:17] evanton: KaibutsuX: thank you
[00:39:27] KaibutsuX: yeah thats what it seems like, I'm about to create some bat files and see what happens
[00:39:30] lukeis: KaibutsuX: https://github.com/AutomatedTester/browsermob-proxy-py/blob/master/browsermobproxy/server.py#L64  ;)
[00:40:03] KaibutsuX: lukeis: for some reason every selenium related code has that line, but kill() is def available
[00:40:12] KaibutsuX: maybe not prior to python2.5 I guess
[00:40:25] lukeis: um, i think it fails on 2.7 too
[00:40:43] lukeis: i don't think it's an attribute error, i think it's an OSError
[00:40:50] lukeis: hmmâ€¦ 
[00:40:58] KaibutsuX: mine doesnt
[00:41:04] KaibutsuX: im on 2.7.6
[00:41:20] KaibutsuX: I have kill, terminate, pretty much everything
[00:42:10] lukeis: windows is particularly painful when it comes to trying to kill a process via pythonâ€¦ for whatever reason
[00:42:27] KaibutsuX: yeah it's giving me the starting pid instead of the actual process
[00:42:35] KaibutsuX: I'll see if I can't figure iot out

[00:50:09] KaibutsuX: it's fucking windows
[00:50:12] KaibutsuX: damnit
[00:50:38] flyinprogramer: why are you starting a proxy for each connection?
[00:50:49] flyinprogramer: why not just have the proxy run as a service all the time on a box ?
[00:50:58] KaibutsuX: that's probably what I'm going to have to do
[00:51:25] flyinprogramer: if you go that route, make sure to restart it every night or so, as it doesn't reclaim ports in the port count
[00:51:43] KaibutsuX: that would be a good reason why not do it that way then ;)
[00:52:02] flyinprogramer: oh i agree, but when you're developing in windows...
[00:52:03] KaibutsuX: this will be run on our farm of virtual machines with hundreds of tests running every day
[00:52:19] flyinprogramer: yup - so i would restart it every so often
[00:52:38] KaibutsuX: well I'll think about this more tomorrow, I'm out
[00:52:46] flyinprogramer: good news is that it starts at 9091 -- so you have aways

[10:51:27] medwards: barancev: keyboard shortcut got us to the js console safely, here's what we see https://www.evernote.com/shard/s253/sh/e769fb85-f225-4868-8566-922e433a7b60/951c1cb01e19df62637f998a5dd7dcb5 (this is the hanging on find_elements_by_name problem yesterday)
[10:52:38] barancev: medwards: would you please remind the context
[10:53:34] barancev: what operation was hanging?
[10:53:36] barancev: do you see the same behaviour on another computer?
[10:53:38] medwards: sure, my QA lead has selenium hang on certain find_elements_by_name calls
[10:54:13] medwards: We're not able to repro on other computers, but no matter what are able to repro on her computer. Browser reinstalls and browser reinstalls with new versions seem to do nothing.
[10:55:15] AutomatedTester: medwards: is that persons python version up to date?
[10:56:50] medwards: AutomatedTester: 2.7.2+ is good enough? (just checking for a baseline, investigating now)
[10:59:01] AutomatedTester: medwards: sorry, meant his Selenium python egg
[10:59:06] medwards: 2.7.1
[10:59:15] medwards: ah its up-to-date
[10:59:22] medwards: we checked that yesterday
[10:59:33] medwards: although maybe she just checked wrong
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Feb  5 11:00:00 2013]
[11:00:00] medwards: I'll doublecheck this but for now lets assume 2.29.0 (latest from PyPI)
[11:00:39] medwards: yup did it myself
[11:01:35] barancev: I don't see call to findElement in the browser log. can it be lost on the python side?
[11:01:59] simonstewart: andreastt: AutomatedTester and I are hacking on the spec today
[11:03:58] medwards: maybe but the traceback seems to point to it at least having been sent over the network
[11:04:04] medwards: I'll pastebin it
[11:08:42] medwards: here's the traceback after I am forced to KeyboardInterrupt https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4713784
[11:09:21] medwards: I see some: "[WEBDRIVER] [INFO] command_processor.js:10196 Ignoring pending about:document-onload-blocker request" messages further up the page, but with no time stamps its hard to tell if they occur before a page load or after
[11:17:32] andreastt: simonstewart: Good, good.  I do intend to do that at some point too.
[11:24:16] AutomatedTester: medwards: those are INFO messages
[11:24:35] kaawee_ has joined #selenium
[11:31:28] andreastt: simonstewart: Shadow DOM?
[11:31:31] andreastt: simonstewart: You are brave.
[11:31:37] simonstewart: http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/
[11:31:54] simonstewart: It'd be a lot easier if a single shadow host couldn't have multiple shadow doms
[11:31:58] simonstewart: all neatly stacked
[11:32:51] jeichar has joined #selenium
[11:32:56] andreastt: I'm not sure I totally see the use case of this spec, but yes.
[11:33:20] medwards: AutomatedTester: welp, like barancev notes, the call must be getting lost somewhere. I thought info messages from the command_processor might help narrow it down.
[11:33:26] simonstewart: I can see it being really useful as someone attempts to componentise their html
[11:33:30] andreastt: The idea that something should be hidden away from the rest of the DOM is just perceived.
[11:33:53] simonstewart: Well, there's no way to get hold of the rendered DOM in the spec that I can see
[11:33:58] AutomatedTester: medwards: have you got a python traceback?
[11:35:11] medwards: yeah its bured in seljenkinsbot output
[11:35:22] medwards: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4713784
[11:35:42] andreastt: Wonderful, compiling Opera in VS2012 crashes VS.
[11:35:53] AutomatedTester: andreastt: \o
[11:36:03] AutomatedTester: medwards: have you got it where it times out the connection?
[11:36:07] simonstewart: andreastt: \o/ surely?
[11:36:10] andreastt: Yes!
[11:36:41] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I shall have you know I've done much Python as of late.  I still can't figure out how to do relative imports in a non-painful way.
[11:37:05] andreastt: Also known as, not having to modify the sys.path.
[11:37:18] AutomatedTester: andreastt: create __init__.py files in relative directories?
[11:37:34] AutomatedTester: then magic happens
[11:37:40] AutomatedTester: the file can be empty
[11:37:45] andreastt: Yeah, I tried that and the .. trick to the import statement.
[11:38:14] medwards: AutomatedTester: you mean eventually the socket will timeout and produce a stacktrace? How long do you think it will take?
[11:38:33] AutomatedTester: medwards: 60s at most
[11:39:22] medwards: interesting. The find_element_by_id bug in FF17 didn't, or did it?
[11:39:41] simonstewart: Right. So, here's my TODO list for the Shadow DOM and WebDriver: 
[11:39:56] simonstewart: 1) How to access a shadow dom from the shadow host
[11:40:08] simonstewart: 2) Amending "activeElement" to remain sane
[11:40:30] andreastt: (Good thing we don't support traversals.)
[11:40:37] simonstewart: 3) Accessing multiple shadow doms all hosted on the same host
[11:41:00] simonstewart: 4) What does the xpath expression "../" mean when on a shadow host?
[11:41:37] admc1 has joined #selenium
[11:41:55] simonstewart: My preference would be to say "when an element is a shadow host, all findElement calls are made on the oldest shadow dom subtree, if the element is a shadow host"
[11:42:14] simonstewart: 5) Changes required to getText
[11:45:19] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Which packages are on the PYTHONPATH from before is seriously confusing.
[11:45:43] andreastt: This is the second time I run into the problem of global packages taking presedence during import over local similarly-named packages.
[11:45:43] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I never care what is in my pythonpath really
[11:45:55] AutomatedTester: andreastt: use virtualenv's
[11:46:04] AutomatedTester: they make life much easier
[11:46:11] AutomatedTester: and avoid global pollution
[11:46:11] andreastt: I don't want people to have to set up virtualenvs to run a simple script.
[11:46:22] andreastt: I say simple.
[11:46:40] andreastt: Even Perl is easier than this.  At least I can understand what it does.

[11:49:23] andreastt: Is it such a strange request to want to have files split into multiple folders, but not to have them in the same namespace?
[11:50:34] AutomatedTester: no
[11:50:59] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but then put put a __init__.py file in each folder and hey presto you can access those other .py files
[11:54:30] medwards: AutomatedTester: herm, its not timing out. Could it be because of WebDriverWait.until wrapping the call? I have ignore_exceptions=AssertionError only, not anything else
[11:55:06] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Not unless you have the root on your PYTHONPATH.
[11:55:10] barancev: medwards: no idea what can cause this
[11:55:27] barancev: I've seen another issue related to hanging findElement #4757

[11:55:39] barancev: but this one looks different
[11:55:49] AutomatedTester: andreastt: or that...
[11:56:01] AutomatedTester: andreastt: but I dont like using PYTHONPATH
[11:56:42] AutomatedTester: andreastt: and since you wanted simplicity I thought you would want to void people wanting pythonpath
[11:56:51] AutomatedTester: but its totally up to you
[11:58:10] medwards: barancev: yeah me too. If it went away on a browser wipe I wouldn't bother you guys with it. Was kind of hoping we could start to identify this, since comment number 8 on that issue sounds like someone experiencing the same thing.
[11:58:20] medwards: It would be nice if SauceLabs had FF18 for OS X :/
[11:59:03] medwards: The next thing I'm going to do is install Selenium Server on this computer and then try to reproduce from my desktop. That should narrow it down to the browser command_executor...
[11:59:37] barancev: at least I can reproduce 4745 locally

[12:47:36] eutheria: chrome 17 for some reason gives a strange connection reset error at the end of this test, is 17 just a bit of a bad release?
[12:48:15] AutomatedTester: eutheria: how many people still use that version of Chrome?

[12:49:11] Ardesco: :)
[12:49:34] eutheria: AutomatedTester, i am aware of that, however someone wrote "must have automated tested on chrome 17"
[12:49:43] eutheria: i might forget about it
[12:49:48] AutomatedTester: I would...
[12:49:59] AutomatedTester: seriously not worth the effort
[12:50:53] Ardesco: if somebody wrote that I would find out why
[12:50:57] eutheria: the person who asked for it will say very bad things to me

[14:29:46] Phil37: there too
[14:29:55] Phil37: ive got 2 buttons, save and close
[14:30:22] Phil37: if you hit close too soon after save, the save doesn't get registered and you're prompted with a popup wether you wantto leave
[14:30:36] Phil37: a little sleep(1000) gives it ample time
[14:30:42] Phil37: should i feel bad for doing this
[14:30:54] Ardesco: then you should be waiting for the save process to finish before hitting close IMHO

[14:31:50] jimevans: Phil37: if the save persistence isn't displayed on the page, you should be looking for it in the data store.
[14:32:09] Ardesco: if the site uses jQuery it tracks ajax requests

[14:33:09] Phil37: I'll work on this
[14:34:38] RossPatterson: We have a similar setup.  Clicking on "Save" disables the save button until the operation completes.  So our tests do "click(saveLocator); waitForEnabled(saveLocator); click(finishedLocator);"
[14:35:15] RossPatterson: Because the human-focised indicator is the grayed-out Save button becoming not-grayed-out.

[14:58:41] garndt: if I remember correctly, the alert object does not hold any state (such as the text of the alert)
[14:59:13] garndt: so once you called alert.text, it issues a command to webdriver, which has no alert currently visible to act upon
[14:59:35] barancev: in Java it *does* hold
[14:59:45] barancev: that's why I asked about python
[14:59:51] garndt: I am speaking about python

[15:01:05] barancev: Ruby does holds, all right
[15:03:09] barancev: simonstewart: should alert.getText() after alert.accept() return the text or throw ?
[15:03:20] simonstewart: NoSuchAlert
[15:03:29] barancev: (I can't find such a test)
[15:03:35] simonstewart: Accepting the request dismisses it, meaning that the text is no longer present

[15:04:27] barancev: is it specified?
[15:04:44] simonstewart: I thought it was
[15:05:09] barancev: what to do with "unhandled" alerts, then?
[15:05:16] simonstewart: UnexpectedAlert
[15:05:23] simonstewart: There's definitely a test for that
[15:05:28] barancev: exception contains a link to the alert, but we can't get its text
[15:06:00] barancev: I mean-- can we get the alert text in the UnexpectedAlertException handler, if it is already autodismissed?
[15:06:01] simonstewart: eh?
[15:07:53] eutheria: hello, i have a laptop i would like to convert to a vm, would would be the best way to do that?

[15:09:39] eutheria: you want this door stop?
[15:09:59] eutheria: 32mb ram, 20 mins battery

[15:10:41] barancev: simonstewart: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/AlertsTest.java#417
[15:11:14] simonstewart: Well that test actually makes sense
[15:11:27] simonstewart: The opening of the alert causes the window close to fail
[15:11:53] eutheria: oops sorry wrong channel
[15:12:01] simonstewart: eutheria: ok
[15:12:03] simonstewart: :)
[15:12:06] eutheria: man i am having a bad day
[15:12:18] simonstewart: barancev: that's a perfectly valid test
[15:13:07] barancev: simonstewart: and this one? https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/AlertsTest.java#200
[15:13:19] barancev: how can they both pass? hmm...
[15:13:40] simonstewart: That's the behaiour I described earlier: if there's no alert, throw a NoAlertPresent
[15:13:54] barancev: ha! testAlertShouldNotAllowAdditionalCommandsIfDismissed tests nothing!
[15:14:14] jimevans: so how can i convert the CSS borderBottomWidth value to a number of pixels? it returns the value as a string ("5px") but it could be specified as a different unit than pixels.
[15:14:15] barancev: actually it does not throw, it returns the cached text of the alert
[15:14:39] simonstewart: barancev: there's a missing "fail" after line 207
[15:14:48] barancev: exactly
[15:15:00] simonstewart: Well, that's an oversight. 
[15:15:01] simonstewart: :)
[15:15:15] barancev: but I think that getText() should not throw
[15:15:27] simonstewart: getText absolutely should
[15:15:35] simonstewart: it's executing on something that doesn't exist
[15:15:42] simonstewart: (in this case)
[15:15:51] simonstewart: alert.dismiss closes the alert
[15:16:15] barancev: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/AlertsTest.java#417 -- in this test the alert is dismissed in the catch block
[15:16:52] barancev: so either *this* test or testAlertShouldNotAllowAdditionalCommandsIfDismissed is not valid
[15:17:16] simonstewart: I don't see where the alert is dimissed in testIncludesAlertInUnhandledAlertException
[15:17:33] barancev: because we have "autodismiss" feature
[15:17:48] simonstewart: The next test should fail, then
[15:18:18] plightbo has joined #selenium
[15:18:28] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[15:18:29] simonstewart: the autodismiss feature should only be invoked if there's an alert present and someone continues attmpeting to do stuff without switching to it
[15:18:44] simonstewart: We throw the UnexpectedAlertPresent and then dismiss the alert
[15:18:50] barancev: yes, driver.getTitle() in this test
[15:18:53] simonstewart: becase normally people aren't expecting it to be present
[15:19:00] simonstewart: Ah.
[15:19:18] simonstewart: Interesting
[15:19:27] simonstewart: Fucked up
[15:19:30] barancev: and this call causes UnhandledAlertException with autodismission
[15:19:45] simonstewart: then testIncludesAlertInUnhandledAlertException isn't doing what we expect
[15:20:03] simonstewart: I think.
[15:20:20] simonstewart: There might be some subtlety around the fact that we've been waiting for the alert
[15:20:27] simonstewart: So we've obviously switched to it
[15:20:36] simonstewart: But I dont think I'd be that cleer
[15:20:38] simonstewart: clever
[15:20:40] barancev: so we can't deal with unhandled alerts, no way to analyse and trace them, it's a bad thing
[15:20:46] simonstewart: (damn fat fingers)
[15:20:48] barancev: current implementation is better imho
[15:21:04] simonstewart: barancev: the exception thrown by UnhandledAlert should contain the alert text
[15:21:21] simonstewart: That's as much data as you'd get out of the alert anyway
[15:21:24] simonstewart: biab
[15:21:59] barancev: with respect to the fact that swithTo().alert() mapped to /session/:sessionId/alert_text -- why don't cache it?
[15:22:34] barancev: nobody can change alert text, caching is safe

[15:29:00] Turzai: Hi
[15:29:07] dude-x has joined #selenium
[15:30:30] barancev: simonstewart: so after switchTo().alert() that is /session/:sessionId/alert_text   next call to getText() should again perform this protocol operation?
[15:30:56] simonstewart: Right
[15:31:08] simonstewart: Because that's how our protocol works: we always go back to the server
[15:31:43] barancev: ok, so we need to change Java and Ruby implementation
[15:31:50] barancev: and formatters in IDE
[15:31:56] simonstewart: yes
[15:32:19] simonstewart: And add a test that the UnexpectedAlertPresent exception contains the alert's text

[15:37:19] simonstewart: "The alert thrown when an unexpected alert is seen should contain the text of the alert"
[15:37:24] barancev: moreover, "getText should always send /session/:sessionId/alert_text" even if we do already know the text
[15:37:34] jarib: ok
[15:37:43] simonstewart: Yay! Less special case code
[15:38:07] jarib: the exception is thrown browser side, though?
[15:38:29] simonstewart: It's thrown browser side. All you need to do is replay the value of the response
[15:38:34] barancev: jarib: yes
[15:38:35] jarib: yeah
[15:38:42] jarib: all good then
[15:39:23] simonstewart: :)
[15:39:41] barancev: btw, if we switched to an alert, and some JS code on the page closes it, we should get NoSuchAlert exception on an attempt to get its text too
[15:40:15] simonstewart: JS is single threaded and blocked by the opened alert
[15:40:25] simonstewart: So that would never happen

[16:01:40] jimevans: or to be more precise, i didn't pay attention to the conversation at all, and now IE is non-compliant.

[16:02:55] simonstewart: There might be genuine differences in layout

[17:30:10] Michael_Wowro: Hi lukeis: If one look at http://seleniumhq.org/about/events.jsp - one might think, that Sel is a dead project ... Wouldn't it be smarter, if all past events from the calendar-rss are shown (or at least 4)?
[17:31:08] lukeis: sure :)  i didn't make that pageâ€¦ i intended to improve it by including meetups automatically, but didn't finish that
[17:31:37] lukeis: it's literally a link to a google calendar maintained by ashley at saucelabs
[17:31:43] Michael_Wowro: hmmm, just changing one date should solve that
[17:31:55] dude-x: lukeis: one thing i learned from all those nanny shows is that you have to talk to your kidsâ€¦ how are your kids disciplined?
[17:32:04] dude-x: lukeis: are they old enough?
[17:32:56] lukeis: the oldest gets itâ€¦ we talk to her, she gets timeouts, we try to explain why we're doing it (usually in tantrum mode she is literally incapable of listening) we wait for her to calm down and then talk to her again about it, then 'make' her apologize :)
[17:33:51] dude-x: what's the 'recidivism' rate?
[17:34:19] lukeis: for a 3 year oldâ€¦ all the freaking time
[17:34:26] dude-x: ah 
[17:34:30] dude-x: yeah they're 3
[17:34:44] lukeis: the 1 yr old is worse ;)
[17:34:49] dude-x: :)

[18:02:21] lukeis: i know ;)
[18:02:41] jimevans: and if you've closed a showModalDialog window, and you have the task manager open, when you close the showModalDialog window, boom!
[18:02:59] lukeis: the simple act of testing that the flash loaded, verses 'you need at least version 10 of flash' when version 11+ is installed...
[18:05:47] jimevans: barancev: yt?
[18:05:54] barancev: yes
[18:06:21] jimevans: so i'm in the process of making two changes to coordinate calculations in the IE driver.
[18:06:38] jimevans: first, is that we will take the border size into account for frames
[18:07:12] jimevans: the second is that we won't blindly throw "element is not displayed" when calling to get the locations
[18:08:26] barancev: do you need my help?
[18:08:37] jimevans: the only test that should need to be ignored for IE in CoordinatesTest after this commit is testShouldGetCoordinatesOfAnEmptyElement

[18:14:31] lukeis: if you depend on autocomplete in python you're doing it wrong ;)_
[18:14:35] barancev: ok, I'll try intellij, for Ruby I use RubyMine from them and I like it

[18:18:04] dude-x: sublime text2 treats every word in a file as a possible autocomplete word

[18:27:28] Espenfjo: jimevans: Yeah.. :)
[18:27:44] barancev: jleyba: I use tabs in FF and Chrome, and an alert on a tab does not prevent serfing in other tabs
[18:27:48] Espenfjo: jimevans: I guess I need to navigate.back and then find all WebElements again?
[18:27:59] jimevans: Espenfjo: yep. you'll need to refind the elements
[18:28:11] Espenfjo: ok, thats what I started to believe. Thank you
[18:28:56] lukeis: Espenfjo: it's much more efficient to not use selenium to 'crawl' sites
[18:29:18] Espenfjo: lukeis: Yeah, I know, but I need something to evaluate and run java scripts

[18:29:32] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[18:29:48] jimevans: think of the browser canvas as a blackboard displaying the content of the page. every time you navigate to a page (even back to a previous one), the blackboard is erased and completely redrawn. the elements in the DOM are the actual chalk on the blackboard that display the content.
[18:29:52] lukeis: ok, then use ghostdriver / phantomjs  (with selenium) ~ will be pretty fast
[18:29:57] jleyba: barancev: It appears newer releases of Firefox restrict the modal dialog to the opening window
[18:30:11] jleyba: Chrome and (Mobile) Safari definitely block every window when a modal dialog is opened
[18:30:23] Espenfjo: lukeis: ok, thanks for the tips
[18:31:24] jleyba: Opera restricts the alert to the opening tab
[18:32:14] barancev: so, it's browser dependent. should we standartize this or leave underspecified?
[18:32:15] jleyba: The behavior is certainly not universal enough for "WebDriver should only intercept alerts from the focused window" to be enshrined in our test suite
[18:32:24] KaibutsuX: is there anything in FirefoxProfile to automatically dismiss the "Script not responding error"
[18:32:41] jleyba: KaibutsuX: You can increase the timeout, but I don't remember the config key
[18:33:01] KaibutsuX: i'll do some digging
[18:33:52] barancev: we can standartize it to be strict -- a single alert in any window block all methods in all windows (read: causes UnexpectedAlertException on any call)
[18:34:02] KaibutsuX: dom.max_script_run_time ?
[18:34:15] jleyba: KaibutsuX: that's it
[18:34:30] jleyba: barancev: SGTM.  Already implemented that way for Safari :)
[18:35:10] jimevans: jleyba, barancev: ugh, please no.
[18:36:21] jimevans: the IE code for figuring out whether an alert is active, and then whether the requested command can be processed based on that is convoluted enough as it is.
[18:37:06] jleyba: jimevans: IE7-9 will block every window if you open an alert
[18:37:18] jleyba: Is the IEDriver able to by pass that?
[18:38:04] jimevans: shouldn't, if all we're talking about is multiple windows on the same session.
[18:38:28] jleyba: yeah, single browser session
[18:38:50] jimevans: but if the alert appears on a window that isn't the focused window (via a setTimeout or the like) we'd probably fail miserably.
[18:39:02] jleyba: we should etiher standardize on raise UnexpectedAlertException for alert opened by any window in the session, or leave it explicitly undefined
[18:39:07] simonstewart: Toodle pip, chaps!
[18:39:10] simonstewart has left #selenium
[18:39:14] jleyba: but we cannot standardize on only the focused window b/c that's not possible in many browsres
[18:40:06] barancev: at least we should be able to switch to the window that owns the alert to dismiss it
[18:40:49] jleyba: alert shouldn't be attached to a specific window
[18:40:59] barancev: aha, good point

[18:47:07] Selenium-Git has left #selenium
[18:47:34] jimevans: a specific window displays the alert. it may block all others in the session, but it was put up by a specific window.
[18:48:06] jimevans: it's legitimate to say that an alert is "owned" or "attached" to a specific window, imo
[18:48:23] jleyba: Yes, but if you get an UnsupportedAlertException, how do you dismiss it if you don't know which window it came from?
[18:48:24] jleyba: Maybe we should just standardize on getAlert() printing a warning to stdout? "Be kind to your users, stop using alerts"
[18:50:52] barancev: jimevans: why do we need to know which window "owns" an alert? how can we use this information?
[18:52:12] jleyba: barancev: I see jimevans point.  If WebDriver can tell you that window A doesn't have an alert, but window B does, it should
[18:52:27] diminoten: is there a way to use selenium without a driver or anything?
[18:52:31] diminoten: just for its html parsing powers
[18:52:36] admc has joined #selenium
[18:52:48] jimevans: diminoten: selenium doesn't parse html. :)
[18:52:48] jleyba: diminoten: Selenium doesn't have html parsing powers
[18:52:56] lukeis: htmlunit does :)
[18:52:58] diminoten: ookay what's the right term then
[18:53:10] jimevans: what are you trying to do?
[18:53:13] diminoten: I'd rather do "find_element_by_foo" than "tree.blah.blah"
[18:53:33] diminoten: I've got the HTML already no need for help there
[18:53:41] barancev: jleyba: the same question -- how can we use this knowledge?
[18:53:46] diminoten: just seems easier to traverse the DOM with selenium than lxml
[18:53:55] diminoten: (might be mincing terms there)
[18:54:30] lukeis: selenium only treats the browser as a puppet, it's the browser that does the parsing / DOM creation etc.
[18:54:31] jleyba: diminoten using WebDriver for DOM traversal is a touchy subject around here :)  You might to take a look at phantomjs though
[18:54:34] barancev: diminoten: use any DOM XML parser + XPath engine
[18:55:03] jimevans: diminoten: depending on the language you're using you may have other options.
[18:55:08] diminoten: python
[18:55:28] diminoten: I can't be the only one to think lxml tree-style traversal is a pain
[18:55:36] lukeis: it is ;)
[18:55:46] jimevans: how about beautiful soup?
[18:56:03] diminoten: reading now
[18:56:11] lukeis: diminoten: the lightest weight thing selenium has to offer right now is ghostdriver / phantomjs
[18:56:42] lukeis: works well with python even ;)
[18:57:17] diminoten: beautiful soup looks reasonable
[18:57:28] diminoten: for what I want, just as long as it's not lxml straight
[18:57:31] jimevans: god the IE driver is such a piece of crap.
[18:58:44] *lukeis does not care to step in itâ€¦ even though i've been doing a little bit of cpp on the side ;)
[18:58:49] barancev: jimevans: jleyba: again, let's suppose we know a window that "owns" an alert, what to do with this information?
[18:59:03] barancev: do we want to expose it to a user?

[19:01:09] barancev: what if I perform any operation in a window when another window has an open alert?
[19:01:37] barancev: if the curent windows is blocked, I should get some exception
[19:02:08] jleyba: Ok, how about this
[19:02:09] barancev: it can't be UnexpectedAlertException
[19:02:28] jleyba: For every command, if there is an open alert that would block the execution of that command, WebDriver returns an UnexpectedAlertException
[19:02:31] barancev: because  driver.switchTo().alert() says NoSuchAlert just before
[19:02:32] jleyba: That leaves it browser specific
[19:03:32] jleyba: Similarly, for switchTo().alert():  Returns the alert blocking the current window. Raises NoSuchAlert if none is present.

[19:11:09] *jimevans was paying very little attention to the language bindings discussion earlier today between barancev and simonstewart.

[19:15:37] barancev: jimevans: ^^^^
[19:16:23] barancev: UnhandledAlertException.UnhandledAlert that does ThrowAlreadyDismissed is a bad thing 
[19:16:32] jimevans: right, so if you attempt to perform an operation in a window in the IE driver where another window in the same session is blocked by an alert, the command is not blocked on the "unalerted" window.
[19:17:29] barancev: a user can set IGNORE unexpected alert behaviour, in this case an alert is present, whereas we tell from UnhandledAlertException.UnhandledAlert that it is dismissed
[19:17:53] jimevans: so it might succeed, might fail depending on the command
[19:18:52] barancev: jimevans: would you please change UnhandledAlertException in dotnet to synchronize it with Java?

[21:41:54] intchanter-work: Cool, thanks.
[21:42:09] intchanter-work: Is that one that should be taken out-of-channel?
[21:42:16] lukeis: i also know that dude-x did some work on thisâ€¦ https://github.com/Dude-X/Selenium2
[21:42:26] lukeis: no, inchannel is appropriate
[21:42:28] bradleymeck: does anyone ever fire JSONWire stuff concurrently (not waiting for the current request to return)
[21:42:31] dude-x: intchanter-work: it will be a while before python3 bindings are done; my stuff is a bit out of date, but it works
[21:42:48] dude-x: though not thoroughly tested
[21:43:10] dude-x: nevertheless, if you look at the changes i've done, they are the changes required to make webdriver work with python3
[21:43:20] lukeis: bradleymeck: that would put you in an inconsistent state and not recommended
[21:43:39] intchanter-work: I got the go-ahead to convert our stuff from the non-maintained perl bindings, so I'll be pleased with anything that can work.
[21:43:52] intchanter-work: And I want to start from Python3 so I don't have to fix it later.
[21:43:57] bradleymeck: lukeis: i understand, i would not do it personally, but seems like something driver writers should support instead of complain about
[21:44:08] intchanter-work: dude-x: I'll take a look at that.  Thanks.
[21:44:53] jimevans: bradleymeck: people complain?
[21:44:54] lukeis: who are you referring to as a 'driver writer'?
[21:44:57] lukeis: :)
[21:45:05] lukeis: jimevans never complains ;)
[21:45:24] jimevans: s/never complains/complains constantly/
[21:45:30] jimevans: there, i fixed it for you. :)
[21:45:32] lukeis: thx
[21:45:46] dude-x: intchanter-work: it's quite possilbe the changes for google chromedriver may no longer be relevantâ€¦ but it's worth checking out
[21:46:16] bradleymeck: lukeis: i am writing a JSONWire driver in node (i know there is one already)

[21:49:51] bradleymeck: lukeis: nope, after seeing commit counts and age i doubt it will change
[21:50:05] jimevans: bradleymeck: you must not try to pump commands to the IE driver for the same session without waiting for a request to return and you run into problems
[21:50:38] jimevans: s/and you/or you will/
[21:50:47] lukeis: they are very susceptible to change actually (well, webdriverjs more so i think)

[22:01:57] intchanter-work: If so, that should simplify the porting.
[22:05:18] lukeis: yeahâ€¦ basically because mac's ship with 2.6/2.7 out of the box, we like to have support for it :)

[22:32:34] Osleg: submit enough patches
[22:32:37] Osleg: patches
[22:32:42] Osleg: ^ >_<

[22:32:56] Osleg: not the permission to commit
[22:32:57] dude-x: :p
[22:33:01] Osleg: but to actual writing :D
[22:33:13] Osleg: it just takes me so slow to write 
[22:33:19] Osleg: and my code is so awkward
[22:33:20] lukeis: you can commit to your own repo ;)
[22:33:31] Osleg: and i have to rewrite so many times to get thing right
[22:33:34] Osleg: :(
[22:34:02] barancev: santiycr: hi!
[22:34:50] dude-x: Osleg: you can fork on github the mirror the repo and write your own patches on your own account. I have a few stuff i did for the python bindings
[22:34:52] barancev: santiycr: no more errors with "establishing TCP connection", but I suspect they just mimic to something different: https://saucelabs.com/tests/3cd1ab7762e74525b02311c34235ec09
[22:35:14] Osleg: dude-x: i did it already :)
[22:35:24] dude-x: that's a start!
[22:35:31] santiycr: barancev:  yup, that's about it. I just made that message more understandable
[22:35:38] Osleg: i mean i forked and looked into it and... then went back to my work :(
[22:36:09] barancev: santiycr: so what's the reason? what to fix? is it on selenium side? any exceptions on the server start?
[22:36:10] lukeis: open source contributing can be small ;) you don't need to do 'big' things, start small
[22:36:19] Osleg: dude-x: and what the stuff u did for python bindings?
[22:36:24] Osleg: may i have a look? :)
[22:36:34] santiycr: barancev: could be on the Sauce side, if the file downloaded is corrupted 
[22:36:51] santiycr: barancev:  I'll add some more logging to test this
[22:36:51] barancev: hmm... reasonable
[22:37:35] barancev: may be we need a checksum?
[22:37:53] barancev: to reattempt downloading if it is broken
[22:40:28] santiycr: yeah, I'll add some checksums in
[22:40:30] Osleg: where is WDAPI docs/dources ?

[22:40:58] santiycr: this is a local network transfer, which should be even more reliable
[22:41:40] barancev: santiycr: btw I've found a UI bug -- see the scrollbar here: http://screencast.com/t/zJcat1s6jn

[22:42:29] Osleg: but thanks :)
[22:42:53] lukeis: that's the github url
[22:43:09] lukeis: (which is just a mirror)
[22:43:10] Osleg: btw why is :code gives you url of googlecode rather github? :)
[22:43:11] selbot2: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/checkout
[22:43:25] lukeis: because that's where the 'canonical' source is
[22:43:29] Osleg: oh, i thought slenium is moved to github

[22:43:36] lukeis: we moved to git

[22:45:01] Osleg: i heard something about that from my frand Lucas... :D
[22:52:47] santiycr: barancev:  tks
[22:53:04] santiycr: barancev:  just added logging of the checksum of the jar on each job, we'll deploy it today
[22:53:19] santiycr: didn't put much effort into validating and stuff
[22:53:21] intchanter-work: Just to make sure I have the workflow... I'll make my changes locally, format a patch, and attach it to an issue?
[22:53:44] santiycr: tomorrow we can go see which ones fail due to this and look whether the sums were valid
[22:53:48] lukeis: intchanter-work: that's one way :)
