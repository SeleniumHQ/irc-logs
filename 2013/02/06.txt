[10:13:17] Fratyr: Hi. If I have a remote server (VPS hosting), which has selenium server installed, and I code locally on my PC connecting to the server using either samba share or WinSCP (ssh) connection - use the selenium? AFAIK, selenium needs browser on the same server where it resides.. and I don't have it on my VPS, there's only console, not X server :<
[10:16:17] barancev: Fratyr: what are you going to run on the VPS if you have no browser there? selenium only can driver a browser, that's its purpose
[10:16:31] barancev: s/driver/drive/
[10:17:36] SamuraiJack_ has joined #selenium
[10:18:48] Fratyr: weird... so actually it forces you to run server with X+browser or code locally :-/
[10:25:30] plightbo_work has joined #selenium
[10:27:19] barancev: Fratyr: you may have a remote host with an X-server, or xvfb, or you may use PhantomJS driver (headless webkit browser)
[10:27:45] barancev: but please explain what do you want to gain from using a VPS machine?
[10:28:18] Fratyr: it's just my dev server that i'm used to work on :)
[10:28:32] Fratyr: with tons of libraries, subdomains and stuff
[10:28:46] Fratyr: i wanted to be able to work the way I used to and add selenium to it
[10:28:57] Fratyr: but adding X server is expensive.. I have only 512MB RAM :(
[10:29:37] barancev: Fratyr: what do you mean by "add selenium to it"? what's the purpose?
[10:29:51] barancev: selenium is a tool to driver a browser
[10:30:01] barancev: no browser => no need in selenium
[10:30:06] Fratyr: I know

[13:10:56] dawagner: Woo! I've finally pushed to our git repo :)
[13:11:14] aimbire: zac_sel: the element is usually present, and i need to wait it become stale, but about 10% of the times, when i go to check it, it's already missing.
[13:12:04] AutomatedTester: zac_sel: the reason why browsers dont do it is because elements arent visible until we scroll to them
[13:12:06] zac_sel: aimbire, then I think you should just wait longer for it to be missing :)
[13:12:33] AutomatedTester: zac_sel: and then browsers look at the markup and render it
[13:12:50] AutomatedTester: zac_sel: it allows things to render lightning fast for above the fold
[13:12:52] aimbire: zac_sel: not the case, it takes about 2-3 seconds tops to get out of my DOM
[13:13:20] aimbire: problem is, sometimes the code hits to wait its staleness and its already out of the page
[13:13:35] aimbire: its good that its missing
[13:13:47] zac_sel: aimbire, I just see yoiu can't rely on staleness but you can rely on elementnotfound so wait for that
[13:13:49] aimbire: code goes okay with a empty catch block
[13:13:51] AutomatedTester: dawagner: do you know if chromedriver can interact with the browser chrome?
[13:14:01] Dude-X_: aimbire, staleness of element should not throw a no such element exception; i am curious to see the code for that
[13:15:39] aimbire: Dude-X_: code is this, atm: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4722439
[13:16:20] aimbire: throws it like its trying to wait a element that is not present
[13:16:41] Dude-X_: aimbire, 'wdi.getDriver().findElement(ElementsChecklist.BLOCKUI)' this segment is throwing the error, not the expected condition
[13:16:48] dawagner: AutomatedTester: I think it currently doesn't, but there's no reason it couldn't
[13:16:49] dawagner: Why?
[13:16:57] pa__ has joined #selenium
[13:17:09] AutomatedTester: dawagner: someone asked me about chromedriver
[13:17:15] AutomatedTester: dawagner: for WebRTC testing
[13:17:17] Dude-X_: aimbire, try to locate the element first before you interact with it to make it disappear. then test that it goes away
[13:17:40] dawagner: Why would you need to interact with the chrome for WebRTC?
[13:17:52] aimbire: Dude-X_: How can i ignore if it's already gone in this case?
[13:18:03] aimbire: because that does happen, unfortunatly ;'(
[13:18:36] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I dont know, I am only being asked the questions
[13:18:44] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I guess the getUserMedia modals
[13:19:29] Dude-X_: aimbire, then write a custom staleness expected condition that takes a locator object instead  of the element
[13:20:31] aimbire: Dude-X_: yeah, that sounds the case here, going to do it, looking at the repo atm.

[14:00:11] andreastt: What does that mean?  There are multiple implementations of that.
[14:00:28] alkemist_ has joined #selenium
[14:00:32] medwards: barancev: BTW, we're able to repro on another computer now, but its setup nearly identically. I'm starting to think its an OS X issue.
[14:00:48] AutomatedTester: andreastt: with Marionette, our UI is pretty much HTML and CSS
[14:00:55] AutomatedTester: its XUL but acts the same
[14:01:15] andreastt: Right.  It doesn't have a generic approach towards UI automation.
[14:01:18] AutomatedTester: so we can apply the same things to Chrome UI as content UI
[14:01:35] andreastt: There are automation hooks written for each UI component which you can call.
[14:01:36] AutomatedTester: well webdriver, as far as I can see, is quite generic

[14:02:10] andreastt: Yes, it's kind of like that for Opera too.
[14:02:19] AutomatedTester: right... 
[14:02:29] *AutomatedTester is not understanding the argument here
[14:02:36] andreastt: Other than us not having XUL, but a custom toolkit with its own query langauge.
[14:02:50] andreastt: It depends what your question is really about.
[14:02:52] eutheria: hello, not entirely a selenium question, in fact not at all, but i am generating data for testing, does anyone know of something to generate large amounts of test data ?
[14:03:29] AutomatedTester: right, so my question is can you access, interact with modals as a user for webrtc
[14:03:57] AutomatedTester: andreastt: the Chrome team have reached out to us
[14:04:01] andreastt: Whether the automation proxy allows for that?  It should, provided the modals have automation hooks.
[14:04:10] andreastt: there are, even.
[14:04:29] andreastt: Technically there should be no reason why the chromedriver couldn't do that for you I think.
[14:04:40] AutomatedTester: andreastt: and we agree on that
[14:05:00] AutomatedTester: all I asked was it going to do it UI level or just make sure sure the modal didnt appear
[14:06:15] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[14:06:25] andreastt: I guess in that context it would do it through the UI.
[14:06:34] AutomatedTester: right...
[14:06:39] AutomatedTester: and that is the simple answer
[14:06:46] AutomatedTester: I wasnt after what hooks etc
[14:06:48] AutomatedTester: how it does it
[14:07:00] AutomatedTester: or how it does it
[14:07:02] andreastt: It's always confusing to know what people mean by ‚ÄúUI interaction‚Äù though.
[14:07:09] andreastt: People seem to have very different ideas about it.
[14:07:34] AutomatedTester: in here its safe to assume they mean webdriver style interaction
[14:07:46] andreastt: That's even more confusing to me (-:

[14:16:54] barancev: I've found another bug with alerts in firefoxdriver
[14:17:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: whats that?
[14:17:24] barancev: if you have two windows you can switch from a window with alert to another window, but you can't switch back
[14:17:43] barancev: and no way to close the alert
[14:17:55] AutomatedTester: thats a specialist use case
[14:18:17] AutomatedTester: and imho if the command after an alert appears doesnt handle it we should error
[14:18:27] millenium: Anyone dealing with jscrollbar? I can't  simulate scroll down in it :(
[14:18:46] AutomatedTester: millenium: find and element and interact with when its not in view
[14:18:51] AutomatedTester: millenium: that will cause a scroll
[14:19:04] barancev: AutomatedTester: what kind of error?
[14:19:09] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[14:19:20] AutomatedTester: unexpected alert error

[14:27:53] millenium: AutomatedTester in FF it work fine but in Chrome element is not viable and I cant interact with invisible elements
[14:34:57] AutomatedTester: barancev: thats probably a highly niche use case
[14:35:13] AutomatedTester: millenium: that sounds like a bug in Firefox
[14:35:21] barancev: AutomatedTester: so what? )
[14:35:28] AutomatedTester: millenium: invisible elements cant be interacted with
[14:36:01] Ardesco: aimbire: are you passing a WebElement into your staleness code of a driver.FindElement(By.locator)
[14:37:41] millenium: no, no, no there is expandable menu, when is clicked on element it add css class which show sub-divs and the scroller expand also (get higher) the problem is that the viable elements go down and in Chrome I need to scroll down to see them in chrome no need to scroll down dor example to find and click on them
[14:39:05] Ardesco: oh i was scrolled back
[14:39:12] Ardesco: probably already answered :P)

[14:49:32] Ardesco: sounds like something "somebody cool" said rather than anything based in reality
[14:50:10] Ardesco: personally I~ use the scroll bar multiple times every day
[14:50:14] aimbire: Ardesco: exactly, but i did a specific ExpectedCondition which checks for both Exceptions
[14:50:34] aimbire: And passes a locator instead of a webelement.
[14:50:38] barancev: what's better -- nose or py.test?
[14:50:49] aimbire: Not sure it's the best code, but way better than a empty catch block
[14:50:52] Ardesco: If you are passing a locator you are missing the point of a stale element exception IMHO
[14:51:05] Ardesco: You should get a webElement, do something with it
[14:51:13] Ardesco: then trigger an action that makes it go stale
[14:51:15] *barancev is a Java-man travelling the Python-land
[14:51:22] Ardesco: and then check for staleness by passing in the webelement
[14:51:45] Ardesco: passing a locator into a check for staleness makes no sense
[14:52:01] Ardesco: because by definition you don't know if it existed before you started waiting for it to go stale
[14:52:18] aimbire: Ardesco: it's a very specific condition honestly, can't figure out another scenario that i could do.
[14:52:42] Ardesco: Whey don't you do a WebElement = driver.findElement(By.id("foo"))
[14:52:48] aimbire: Since the sometimes the WebElement already does not exists when i'm waiting for it to became Stale
[14:52:52] aimbire: its a matter of ms
[14:52:55] Ardesco: then trigger the event that would remove/replace the webelement
[14:53:00] Ardesco: and then do your wait condition
[14:53:16] Ardesco: if it doesn't exist it is *not* going stake
[14:53:24] aimbire: I really wished i could think of another way, but nothing makes sense.
[14:53:26] Ardesco: it just doesn't exist
[14:53:36] AutomatedTester: barancev: py.test imho
[14:53:42] Ardesco: s/stake/stale/
[14:53:45] AutomatedTester: barancev: we use py.test with the selenium build
[14:53:50] aimbire: It's pretty random.
[14:53:52] AutomatedTester: and we use it in Mozilla for webqa
[14:54:00] aimbire: When the event triggers the element must become stale.
[14:54:05] Ardesco: I don't believe it's random
[14:54:13] Ardesco: it's been coded to work a specific way
[14:54:22] Ardesco: I doubt there is a random element generator in the code
[14:54:23] Ardesco: :)
[14:55:00] Ardesco: sounds more like you are waiting for invisibilityOf and element
[14:55:08] barancev: AutomatedTester: how do you integrate your tests into a CI? can pytest do parallel runs?
[14:55:08] Ardesco: gah
[14:55:11] Ardesco: s/and/an/
[14:55:15] aimbire: It is there on the DOM. But every now and then the element is already removed from the page when the code gets to check its Staleness. Nothing i can actually do because this wait comes right after the action that triggers the element to become stale.
[14:55:23] AutomatedTester: barancev: we use Jenkins and Py.test
[14:55:35] AutomatedTester: and we run tests in parallel
[14:55:42] aimbire: Ardesco: nope, the element doesn't get invisible, it gets removed from the DOM.
[14:56:20] aimbire: Its a element generated by a AJAX-Request.
[14:56:27] Ardesco: if it's removed from the DOM it's no longer visible
[14:56:39] Ardesco: hence invisibilityOf is probably the ExpectedCondition you want
[14:57:08] aimbire: Yes, indeed. But the problem is the way this element is created. Its not one, Its a group of elements with the same locator.
[14:57:17] barancev: AutomatedTester: I can't find info about parallel runs in the docs http://pytest.org/latest/contents.html
[14:57:42] AutomatedTester: barancev: http://pytest.org/latest/xdist.html
[14:57:52] AutomatedTester: google is an amazing thing
[14:57:55] aimbire: Tried looping everyone to become invisible, but in one point they go stale and the driver gets lost.
[14:58:01] Ardesco: aimbire: there will be a way to distinguish it
[14:58:08] barancev: ah, they call it "distributed"

[15:00:11] barancev: AutomatedTester: thanks, I'll dig it
[15:00:32] aimbire: once they are out of the DOM, page becomes stable and can be interacted upon
[15:00:41] Ardesco: i suggest you use wait.until(ExpectedConditions.invisibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(".aClass")))
[15:00:59] Ardesco: as each one drops out the next will be the first found
[15:01:02] Ardesco: until none are left
[15:01:15] Ardesco: I'm assuming java here
[15:01:21] aimbire: Yea its java.
[15:01:23] Ardesco: so convert to your language binding of choice
[15:01:28] aimbire: But invisibility doesn't work.
[15:01:43] aimbire: I get NoSuchElementException everytime.

[16:42:48] dude-x: take a look at my github though and my py23 branch
[16:42:52] intchanter-work: From my research, it looks like it'll be beneficial to move the existing python directory to python2 and create a new one in python3.

[16:44:31] eutheria: thanks
[16:44:42] dude-x: but if there is other javascript that runs after that event, you will have to wait for those events your self
[16:44:46] eutheria: weird, sometimes i get errors saying it can't find an id
[16:45:09] dude-x: there is probably other javascript interfering
[16:45:23] eutheria: shouldn't be the site is js free
[16:45:29] dude-x: oh
[16:46:25] dude-x: i write a wrapper to the webdriver api to always try more than once to do something until it times out
[16:46:30] intchanter-work: dude-x: Is that somewhere other than https://github.com/Dude-X/Selenium2 ?  This one looks like it was forked from a different repo.
[16:46:44] dude-x: intchanter-work: yea it's that one
[16:47:01] dude-x: it's the older repo before the main codebase moved to git on googlecode
[16:47:14] dude-x: also i haven't worked on it since the fall
[16:47:31] intchanter-work: It'll still be useful to see the majority of the necessary changes.
[16:47:31] dude-x: if you look at the python3 branch it shows the major changes I did
[16:47:33] dude-x: yeah
[16:47:51] dude-x: my gut feeling says the python2-3 branch might have a few extra changes/bug fixes
[16:47:57] dude-x: but look at the dates

[17:08:08] AutomatedTester: him biased towards watir? never...
[17:08:33] *AutomatedTester does realise that is a pot -> kettle comment
[17:10:58] adamgoucher: jimevans: you might try zeljkof though i dont know how much of his stuff at wikimedia is with ie
[17:13:41] jimevans: i'm just looking for publicly posted reference material at this point. the IE driver is a piece of shit when it comes to performance. i know this. i'd also like to explain why, possibly in a blog post of my own, but i'd really rather not reference the long-standing‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ discussions (yeah, we'll call 'em "discussions") i've had with alister.
[17:15:21] adamgoucher: the only other person i can think of that uses watir all the time is chzy, but he uses it inside cucumber so there are extra layers of magic happening there
[17:15:26] jimevans: what i really want is a bunch of blog posts/tweets/mail threads that i can link to that say "the IE driver is a piece of shit because it's so damned slow", with bonus points if the same item says "i'd rather use watir/watin because it's so much better, faster, and stable"
[17:17:07] AutomatedTester: jimevans: only person who did perf blog post is Alister and jarib pulled his timings apart saying they didnt show anything because they were done wrong...
[17:17:26] AutomatedTester: thats the only one I have read

[18:28:01] dude-x: they're exact
[18:29:06] intchanter-work: It looks like simplejson-2.4.0 is sufficient for the py3 changes.  The package itself is available up to 3.0.7.  Do you have a preference?
[18:30:12] intchanter-work: I assume the upgrade is needed mostly for unicode handling support.
[18:31:02] dude-x: use the latest
[18:31:03] dude-x: doesn't hurt
[18:31:07] intchanter-work: k
[18:31:10] dude-x: actually, test it with the latest
[18:31:12] alkemist has joined #selenium
[18:31:34] intchanter-work: Will do.
[18:32:26] dude-x: i think i used the latest of the time, or the latest one to support py3
[18:32:37] dude-x: err the earliest to support py3
[18:33:04] intchanter-work: I'll make sure I get one that supports py2.6+.
[18:34:48] intchanter-work: Latest says 2.5+ and 3.0+.
[18:35:27] intchanter-work: whatasec...
[18:36:44] intchanter-work: According to the readme, we should be able to use the json stdlib.
[18:36:59] intchanter-work: "simplejson is the externally maintained development version of the json library included with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, but maintains backwards compatibility with Python 2.5."
[18:37:26] intchanter-work: Since we only support as far back as 2.6, we shouldn't need it anymore.
[18:37:37] dude-x: simplejson has a c extenson
[18:37:47] dude-x: i think that could be updated too
[18:38:42] intchanter-work: Any drawbacks you see from switching simplejson -> json other than maybe slower updates?
[18:40:02] dude-x: no drawbacks really, but the advantage is that updates can fix bugs that may be in the stdlib
[18:40:52] intchanter-work: I can't estimate how likely we would be to need that.
[18:41:18] intchanter-work: Reducing our shipped dependencies by one seems like a win overall, though.
[18:41:25] intchanter-work: And if needed, we could pull it in again.
[18:43:05] dude-x: if the c code gets faster, that's always a win
[18:43:18] dude-x: though python bindings don't need much speed really
[18:43:39] jcarr has joined #selenium
[18:44:04] intchanter-work: Sounds like it's at least worth testing whether we can get by without simplejson.  I'll give it a try.
[18:45:04] dude-x: i thought the same way too but i think i left it in for the RC users who we support with python 2.5
[18:45:08] dude-x: but maybe that will be moot...
[18:45:24] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[18:45:51] intchanter-work: That may be a good point.  I was operating under the understanding that 2.6 was the limit of our support.
[18:46:24] *intchanter-work laughs.
[18:47:06] intchanter-work: The code says: try: import json \n except ImportError import simplejson as json.
[18:47:12] Michael_Wowro has joined #selenium
[18:47:31] intchanter-work: And then one further check to make sure that json has a "dumps" attribute, and if not import simplejson as json.
[18:47:52] Michael_Wowro: lukeis: my first pull request, so please be patient with me :)

[18:49:12] dude-x: although it doesn't affect webdriver users for the most part
[18:49:20] dude-x: it does have a fast c extension
[18:49:33] intchanter-work: But we only use it if we don't have a suitable json.
[18:50:12] intchanter-work: So who can give us confirmation on the 2.5 question?
[18:50:12] dude-x: true

[18:51:25] Michael_Wowro: cool
[18:51:54] intchanter-work: AutomatedTester: To prevent scrollback log reading, we need to know whether Python 2.5 support is still desirable for RC users, as it may affect whether we continue to include simplejson or just use the standard json library.

[18:56:47] lukeis: that jenkins job pushes to production
[18:57:22] lukeis: keep in mind you need to go to "www.seleniumhq.org" or "docs.seleniumhq.org"   ("seleniumhq.org" still needs a redirect)
[18:57:57] lukeis: adamgoucher: yeah, but don't mac's still ship with 2.6?
[18:58:13] adamgoucher: so? upgrade.
[18:58:20] lukeis: ;)
[18:58:27] intchanter-work: It looks like we may get 2.6 support without anything extra above what 2.7 support requires anyway.
[18:58:31] Michael_Wowro: lukeis: ah ok, that's really quick! Now you can add the SeConf2013 - than it looks even better
[18:58:33] intchanter-work: Not positive on that yet.

[19:11:39] dude-x: which means 'right'
[19:11:51] intchanter-work: Nice.  :-)
[19:12:11] dude-x: but J did not exist in roman times
[19:12:16] dude-x: so they used an I 
[19:12:50] dude-x: how that I sound became the 'j' sound today is unknown tom e
[19:13:43] dude-x: if you look at a detailed crucifix, it will have the description "INRI" but technically it should be JNRJ, jesus of nazareth, rey (king) of the jews

[22:16:46] lukeis: are you cloning from googlecode or github?
[22:16:55] stackedsax: googlecode
[22:17:51] stackedsax: ah, I see github's a mirror.  didn't realize
[22:18:23] lukeis: you can do either‚Ä¶ but i often found googlecode faster
[22:18:48] adamgoucher: dude-x: if i have another in 3 hours i'll be good until 1130 or so. but it really could be naptime right now.
[22:19:20] stackedsax: lukeis: really?  it's going at about 50kb/s for me right now.
[22:19:29] lukeis: yeah, that bites...
[22:19:37] lukeis: start a clone to github in parallel? :)
[22:19:47] stackedsax: already doing so :)

[22:52:38] jimevans: holy hand grenades of antioch! i think i've got asynchronous clicks working for synthetic events in IE.
[22:57:14] gabrielrotbart has joined #selenium
[22:58:44] dude-x: what's an asynch click, jim?
[22:59:22] jimevans: a click using javascript that doesn't block when an alert is thrown. the classic problem with synthetic events in IE.

[23:01:16] dude-x: so in other words, you can process a click and then throw an error about an unhandled click; without it locking up?
[23:04:19] jimevans: you can click on an element (using synthetic events - JavaScript only) that displays an alert, and not lock up your webdriver code.

[23:07:22] dude-x: synthetic events as in the Actions class?
[23:07:30] dude-x: or in general
[23:07:50] lukeis: as in native events == false
[23:08:46] dude-x: yeah i guess that makes sense

[23:29:34] intchanter-work: dude-x: I've pushed my changes so far up to my copy on github.  I'll be able to continue working on it tomorrow.
[23:29:55] intchanter-work: And for all: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461687407/kickstarter-open-source-death-star
[23:30:05] dude-x: i'll clone your branch then
[23:30:44] intchanter-work: It's looking fairly promising for being able to support both in one repo.
[23:31:08] intchanter-work: I'm going to try to solidify my understanding of relative imports overnight.
[23:31:21] dude-x: intchanter-work: i thought kickstarter curated the posts
[23:31:41] intchanter-work: That's actually listed as one of the challenges.  :-)
[23:32:40] intchanter-work: See you tomorrow.
[23:33:48] dude-x: night
[23:33:58] dude-x: i remember now, kickstart waits till the end date to fund
