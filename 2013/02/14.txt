[09:32:08] rightshift: They'd be testing in Firefox / IE / Chrome and Opera.
[09:32:46] rightshift: I assume I'd need the Selenium server by default and then Selenium IDE for Firefox, Internet Explorer Driver Server for IE?

[09:52:22] Manoj_: fine, are you trying to use IDE ? If yes, then selenium IDE for firefox would do.
[09:53:02] Manoj_: if you use WebDriver, then you will need a executable for chrome and for firefox nothing is required.

[13:25:52] itsmikerudolph: are the html pages used in the tests I see being run on Sauce Labs in the code anywhere?
[13:26:31] mreedell-work has joined #selenium
[13:26:59] RossPatterson: I think they're in /common/src/web
[13:28:16] farlan has joined #selenium
[13:31:28] itsmikerudolph: Awesome
[13:33:01] itsmikerudolph: Is there a good person to chat with who contributes to Selenium Web Driver about how my company is trying to implement it and a good approach on how to tackle what we are trying to test?
[13:34:05] RossPatterson: You're here :-)
[13:34:23] RossPatterson: You can also try the selenium-users@googlegroups.com mailing list.  Lots of selenistas there.
[13:35:24] itsmikerudolph: Lots of people here have experience with integrating Sauce Labs for tests?
[13:35:46] RossPatterson: Well, there are never "lots" of people here.
[13:36:15] RossPatterson: But some of them (not me) use Sauce, and the folks who put together the Selenium Project's test setup hang out here.
[13:36:57] itsmikerudolph: Right on, most people who come here on the West Coast?
[13:37:46] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[13:37:47] RossPatterson: Some US-east, a few US-west, and a bunch of UK-and-Europe
[13:38:23] itsmikerudolph: Right on
[13:38:35] itsmikerudolph: so is the web driver mostly used for single session browser testing?
[13:38:57] eanxgeek|log has joined #selenium
[13:39:17] itsmikerudolph: What I am working on is multi user tests
[13:39:40] itsmikerudolph: So basically 7-8 browsers being tested at the same time sharing a single session inside of an app
[13:39:44] RossPatterson: Yes, although there are a number of folks using it to automate web apps (i.e., not testing).
[13:39:51] RossPatterson: "session"?
[13:40:14] itsmikerudolph: "shared instance" of a web app
[13:40:18] stan has joined #selenium
[13:40:48] RossPatterson: So, multiple users interacting with the same server, whose activities impinge on each other?
[13:40:56] itsmikerudolph: Yes!
[13:40:58] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[13:41:01] RossPatterson: No problem.
[13:41:26] itsmikerudolph: I have started writing tests in ruby
[13:41:31] RossPatterson: Your test script needs to start a separate WebDriver (i.e., separate browser) for each user, and control them independently.
[13:41:50] itsmikerudolph: Yeah, thats what I have been doing
[13:41:56] RossPatterson: I don't speak Ruby, but the capabilities of each language binding are generally equivalent.
[13:42:27] itsmikerudolph: is there a "preferred" lang for writing tests? 
[13:42:33] itsmikerudolph: one favoured over the others
[13:43:13] jimevans has joined #selenium
[13:48:31] RossPatterson: No preferred language.  Java, .NET (e.g., C#), and Python have strong support, Ruby also (I think).  Use what you like.
[13:51:04] itsmikerudolph: I read somewhere that Sauce Labs recommends keeping tests to 30 seconds max, is that something people follow?
[13:52:26] RossPatterson: Dunno about that.
[13:53:02] itsmikerudolph: Is there a general time to keep tests under for web driver in general?
[13:53:20] Hroft has joined #selenium
[13:53:54] jimevans: itsmikerudolph: i don't know about sauce labs recommending that, but as a tester, and as a general rule, i'd recommend that. shorter tests means it's more likely that you're testing localized, atomic stuff, and in general means quicker feedback.
[13:53:55] RossPatterson: No limit, no.  My outfit has tests that regularly run 8-10 minutes, and one of other guys mentioned yesterday that he has a scenario that runs 30 minutes.
[13:54:37] jimevans: but that's just my opinion. it doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, because i don't know what i'm talking about.
[13:55:45] itsmikerudolph: been getting a lot of Timeout::Errors lately, scheduled a call with Sauce Labs today to discuss the root of that. 
[13:55:53] itsmikerudolph: http requests are just hanging 
[13:56:03] RossPatterson: That does indeed sound like a Sauce problem.
[13:56:33] RossPatterson: Unless it's a can't-find-the-element-you're-looking-for timeout.
[13:57:12] itsmikerudolph: Nope
[13:57:37] simonstewart: itsmikerudolph: I'm here if you want to talk about implementing webdriver
[13:57:46] simonstewart: (was AFK just then)
[13:58:13] itsmikerudolph: Since I am testing multiple browsers in a shared instance, when ever I change a page I need to wait for all of the browsers to load the page before proceeding, sometimes all the pages load quickly, sometimes one gets hung up
[13:58:47] simonstewart: Are you doing something like that Adobe Shadow, where the browsers all reflect the same thing?
[13:59:04] simonstewart: Or are you just wanting to run the same test across multiple browsers?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Feb 14 14:00:16 2013]
[14:00:16] itsmikerudolph: all browsers reflect the same thing, one browser will do an action on web page, need to verify that the other browsers received it and completed the same action 
[14:04:45] Hroft: Hi guys! Can anybody upload debug version of IEDriverServer? I have random crashes with IE9, but haven't full MSVS, express only :(
[14:05:23] simonstewart: itsmikerudolph: you might find Edge Inspect better for that automated following of manual testing: http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/

[14:06:29] jimevans: Hroft: if you have a reproducible case, i can help, but unfortunately, you must have visual studio 2010 professional or higher to build the IE driver executable. 
[14:07:16] stephend has joined #selenium
[14:07:46] jimevans: Hroft: the reason is that the IE driver uses Active Template Library smart pointers to manage COM objects, and microsoft refuses to make that framework available for express users.
[14:09:26] jimevans: why ATL? managing COM object lifetimes without using a smart pointer library is like giving oneself a root canal. one can do it, but it's going to be painful either way, doing it correctly without the supporting help is infinitely harder, and the chances of doing it correctly are exceedingly small.
[14:09:53] *garndt tries to figure out a way to convince his boss to get a VS2010 license
[14:10:04] jimevans: having said that, if anyone wants to undertake the massive project of stripping out the use of ATL in the IE driver's C++ code, I'll gladly review the code/pull requests.
[14:10:24] simonstewart: garndt: 2010? Why not 2012?
[14:10:57] garndt: simonstewart: I was only going by the version Jim reference a couple of minutes ago.  If 2012 would work just the same, that is what I would try to get
[14:11:00] jimevans: simonstewart: if he wants to work on the IE driver, 2010 is a much better choice, since that requires no conversion of the projects.
[14:11:09] simonstewart: k
[14:11:17] simonstewart: Do what jimevans says :)
[14:11:19] jimevans: and i can't speak for what changes have been made to the runtime.
[14:11:25] jimevans: (though they shouldn't matter)
[14:11:34] simonstewart: jimevans: do we want to consider bumping up to 2012 at some point?
[14:11:54] jimevans: be happy to. would someone want to buy me a copy? :)
[14:12:24] simonstewart: Doesn't SF have an MSDN Ultimate license?
[14:12:43] bluescreen10 has joined #selenium
[14:13:22] jimevans: first, probably not (we're a java shop). second, i'd probably have to jump through a number of administrative hoops to get a license.
[14:15:12] simonstewart: Well, that's suboptimal.
[14:15:16] simonstewart: How much is it these days?
[14:15:31] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[14:15:48] garndt: Those administrative hoops are the thing I need to figure out how to get around here.  They never like giving out any licenses for anything anymore

[14:17:13] simonstewart: I hate the politics thing. Why don't companies give devs the tools they need to do their job?
[14:17:51] garndt: I find that the larger the company gets, the worse it gets to get anything around here.  Software, hardware, etc
[14:18:26] jimevans: simonstewart: because, y'know, money.
[14:18:46] garndt: we were fine when we were a much smaller company, but through a few acquisitions and now being part of a behemoth, it's nearly impossible to get anything and I need to give blood samples and first borns.
[14:18:50] simonstewart: Ah. They'll make more money by preventing devs from working properly?
[14:19:08] garndt: simonstewart: When they make more money, they want to make sure they keep that money!
[14:19:31] simonstewart: Oh well. Glad that's not a problem here
[14:19:34] jimevans: simonstewart: actually, that's the theory. they'll make more by not spending as much on licenses. note that i don't necessarily subscribe to that theory.
[14:20:19] SamuraiJack has joined #selenium
[14:20:20] garndt: At least here, it's more to do with short term thinking and making quarterly goals rather than thinking long term and enabling people to do more 
[14:20:44] jimevans: i'll order a copy of vs2012 in a few days when my company store balance resets. :)
[14:21:02] simonstewart: Hurrah!
[14:22:12] jimevans: i'd been lazy about it and not renewed my alumni network membership, because the company store is the very last place to get stock of inventory, and it wasn't worth it to attempt buying vs2012 in the first few months because they wouldn't have any.

[15:39:30] codepython777: for webdriver.get() - how do i wait for page to be loaded?
[15:39:38] christoe has joined #selenium
[15:39:41] garndt: codepython777: carefully
[15:39:47] simonstewart: It'll hang on until the onload event is fired
[15:39:53] simonstewart: After that, you need to handle things yourself
[15:40:26] codepython777: How do i write the python code for it? Iwas hoping to find wait_until_page_loaded...
[15:41:55] codepython777: simonstewart: so get() already waits for onload event to fire?
[15:42:09] simonstewart: should do
[15:42:16] simonstewart: of course, that's next to useless these days
[15:42:28] simonstewart: since almost everyone uses a ton of ajax events fired in the onload handler
[15:42:56] garndt: codepython777: webdriver's standard way of waiting will get you most of the way there.  If you find that the page is not always loaded when you attempt to interact with it, then it's a sort of art in determining when your page is ready
[15:43:06] codepython777: time.sleep seems lame. wait for an element to appear seems page dependent
[15:43:13] garndt: time.sleep is lame (most of the time)
[15:43:29] garndt: waiting for an element is indeed page dependent, but I don't think there is something wrong with that
[15:43:51] jimevans: codepython777: waiting for an element to appear *is* page-dependent. but a one-size-fits-all approach is next to impossible with modern websites.
[15:44:02] garndt: in some problematic pages, I will define an end element in my page objects, and then wait for those to determine when the page is done being rendered.
[15:44:26] dude-x: codepython777: using a tool like firebug and firediff you can see what is the element that is loaded/modified. then you wait for that element to be present
[15:44:48] garndt: basically all of my page objects have some method for navigating to that page.  Part of that method is to wait for an "end element" if one is defined for the page object.  That method is shared for all page objects I create.
[15:45:31] jimevans: simonstewart: so let me make sure i understand. you want to push a 2.30 now, and a 2.31 next week when firefox 19 ships?
[15:45:41] garndt: codepython777: ^^^ that solves most of my problems.  There are some rare circumstances where I need to do something more, maybe even add a time.sleep if necessary.
[15:45:50] codepython777: cool
[15:45:53] simonstewart: jimevans: yes
[15:46:10] simonstewart: Because there's a lag between a firefox release and us getting native events working
[15:46:24] codepython777: how do i tell this to sel/webdriver - wait till the title element is available on the page? (then i can just rig my own end element)
[15:46:28] simonstewart: but this time, the firefox update will break every single test because we can no longer connect
[15:46:33] jimevans: simonstewart: i'm down with that. though the native events piece shouldn't take that long. :)
[15:46:42] simonstewart: True
[15:46:45] simonstewart: But it will take time
[15:46:48] jimevans: it often does, but it shouldn't.
[15:46:55] garndt: codepython777: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-and-implicit-waits
[15:46:56] dude-x: codepython777: you'll have to figure that out yourself using an element inspector like firebug on firefox
[15:46:58] simonstewart: codepython777: the expected conditions have one of those conditions already
[15:47:23] dude-x: oh and use expected conditions with webdriver wait
[15:49:07] garndt: codepython777: basically you want WebDriverWait in selenium.webdriver.support.ui
[15:50:42] codepython777: ui.webdriverwait.until(lambda driver: driver.title.lower().startswith('cheese!'))

[15:55:10] garndt: why shouldn't it work?
[15:56:15] codepython777: the apidocs say i should import it from selenium.webdriver.support.wait.WebDriverWait
[15:56:20] garndt: ui imports selenium.webdriver.support.wait and selenium.webdriver.support.select

[17:49:43] jeichar has joined #selenium
[17:50:50] dude-x: codepython777: i think it will install fine because python3.3 supports u' strings, but it will fail because there are a few unicode function calls which is not defnied in py3

[18:12:10] jleyba: jimevans: sorry about that one.  Spending too much time in node, forgetting forEach isn't available everywhere

[18:14:58] codepython777: It installs on 3.3, but getting firefox to work is already an issue?
[18:15:16] codepython777: or is this something i am doing wrong?
[18:15:25] dude-x: codepython777: selenium only works with python 2.6 or 2.7 at the moment
[18:15:26] codepython777: firefox does startup in 3.3
[18:15:44] dude-x: it may start up but it won't be able to communicate
[18:16:18] intchanter-work: codepython777: https://github.com/intchanter/selenium/tree/py23 has a branch you can clone and try out.  It's still a work in progress, but I hope to have it stable enough to do a pull request by tomorrow.
[18:17:37] intchanter-work: To build with python3, you'll need to modify the virtualenv = line in rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/python.rb to add a --python=python3 option.
[18:18:17] intchanter-work: I'm currently troubleshooting the tests, as they hang in a few places.
[18:18:40] dude-x: intchanter-work: we should probably set instructions to create an egg to install
[18:18:59] dude-x: they hang for me too
[18:19:30] intchanter-work: dude-x: That would be awesome.  I'm not strong in packaging yet, so I don't know exactly what will be required for that.
[18:20:00] dude-x: i think it's just a go command. hopefully i'll have it somewhere in my notes
[18:20:05] dude-x: otherwise ill bother AT or luke
[18:20:22] intchanter-work: The changes I just pushed will get you through the first test file with passes, at least.
[18:21:09] intchanter-work: I've been rm -r build/ and copying in the test/ directory each time I make a change so the build process won't reuse the old ones.  Is there a better way to do that?
[18:24:11] dude-x: ./go clean
[18:24:33] dude-x: i'd write a script
[18:24:41] dude-x: to recopy the test directory

[19:30:06] barancev: may be *this* is the cause? text mode?
[19:30:06] santiycr: making the code read it in binary mode fixed the problem
[19:30:09] jimevans: i can attest that windows is stupid about that.

[19:33:39] jcarr: jimevans: yeah, I know. The iphonedriver's storyboard conversion broke one of the ways sauce uses it, and when I fixed it for sauce I figured I'd commit it back.

[19:40:44] santiycr: you'd think 30 is plenty of time for it to start listening on a port, but this is java and windows
[19:41:21] santiycr: between the jvm start + Selenium start + windows slowness + vm performance, this could be the cause

[23:41:35] intchanter-work: May still be worth seeing if it behaves differently as a test.
[23:41:36] dude-x: anyone who started doing real work is using at least 3.2 or 3.1
[23:41:59] dude-x: Python Core devs are not supporting 3.0 so we shouldn't either
[23:42:06] *stephend wonders who has le bacon
[23:42:22] intchanter-work: France?
[23:42:23] lukeis: i think simon ;)
[23:42:29] stephend: intchanter-work++
[23:42:32] stephend: ah, cool
[23:43:03] intchanter-work: See you guys tomorrow.
[23:45:46] KaibutsuX: I will keep that in mind, I do know 3 treats all strings as unicode
[23:46:12] diminoten: possibly off topic but I don't suppose anyone knows how to do a nofollow in python's requests library
[23:46:14] KaibutsuX: that seems like an improvement, I have blocks of isinstance('unicode') littered everywhere
[23:46:26] KaibutsuX: what is a nofollow?
[23:46:45] diminoten: instead of goint to the redirect, stop
[23:47:44] diminoten: you can set max-redirect in wget
[23:47:49] KaibutsuX:     :param allow_redirects: (optional) Boolean. Set to True if POST/PUT/DELETE redirect following is allowed.
[23:48:03] diminoten: where did you find that?
[23:48:11] KaibutsuX: api.py request method
[23:48:13] KaibutsuX: in the docstring
[23:48:19] KaibutsuX: line 30
[23:48:23] diminoten: huh
[23:48:28] diminoten: I was searching for nofollow
[23:48:29] diminoten: thanks!
[23:48:32] KaibutsuX: np

[23:50:19] lukeis: against sehq
[23:50:30] lukeis: talk about a random url
[23:51:39] KaibutsuX: damnit, I want to click it :)
[23:51:59] lukeis: "404" is key there
[23:52:25] lukeis: no, sehq is not hosting p0rn
[23:52:59] KaibutsuX: but that will always be the dream
