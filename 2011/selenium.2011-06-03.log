2011-06-03T03:30:13  <jarib> that way you can specify this when you launch the server instead of having the client know where chrome is located on the server...
2011-06-03T03:30:35  <jarib> which obviously is less than ideal

2011-06-03T04:01:56  <lisak> can't figure out why code like this doesn't work
2011-06-03T04:02:01  <lisak> ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("document.getElementsByClassName('" + uploadButton + "')[0].click()");
2011-06-03T04:02:13  <lisak> WebDriverException: document.getElementsByClassName("upload-button")[0].click is not a function
2011-06-03T04:02:50  <lisak> the last parentheses gone ?
2011-06-03T04:03:15  <jarib> lisak: the important part: "is not a function"
2011-06-03T04:03:37  <lisak> there can be only a function ?
2011-06-03T04:03:51  <lisak> I thought that it's a callback
2011-06-03T04:04:00  <jarib> if [0] returns undefined
2011-06-03T04:04:08  <jarib> or null
2011-06-03T04:04:16  <jarib> then neither of those have a click function
2011-06-03T04:04:24  <jarib> why wouldn't you use webdriver to locate the element?
2011-06-03T04:04:30  <jarib> instead of doing it yourself in javascript
2011-06-03T04:04:57  <jarib> findElement(By.className("upload-button"))
2011-06-03T04:05:39  <lisak> it actually works, but the JS execution breaks afterwards
2011-06-03T04:05:57  <lisak> trying to see if it breaks even when called directly via JS
2011-06-03T04:06:07  <jarib> still, locate the element in webdriver
2011-06-03T04:06:08  <jarib> then do:
2011-06-03T04:06:26  <jarib> driver.executeScript("arguments[0].click()", element)
2011-06-03T04:06:32  <lisak> I cannot figure out how to use firebug
2011-06-03T04:06:40  <lisak> because webdriver always starts a new instance
2011-06-03T04:06:57  <lisak> and firebug is closed and cannot set breakpoints
2011-06-03T04:07:03  <lisak> unless "reload" the page
2011-06-03T04:07:17  <lisak> jarib, and the "element" is what ?
2011-06-03T04:07:25  <lisak> not WebElement, right ?
2011-06-03T04:07:34  <jarib> yes, WebElement
2011-06-03T04:08:09  <jarib> driver.executeScript("arguments[0].click()", driver.findElement(By.className("upload-button")))
2011-06-03T04:08:50  <jarib> however, WebElement.click() usually does a much better job at clicking than just a JS click
2011-06-03T04:09:07  <lisak> that gave me the same error
2011-06-03T04:09:16  <lisak> that's why I tried that way
2011-06-03T04:09:16  <lisak> arguments[0].click is not a function
2011-06-03T04:09:32  <jarib> what sort of element is this?
2011-06-03T04:10:05  <jarib> lisak: not all elements have a click function

2011-06-03T04:13:40  <jarib> lisak: sounds like you have an element earlier in the DOM with the same class.
2011-06-03T04:14:43  <lisak> upload-button is only one, really
2011-06-03T04:16:02  <lisak> tagName is <a
2011-06-03T04:16:28  <lisak> it is really the anchor, the only element with upload-button class
2011-06-03T04:19:09  <jarib> then i have no idea why it doesn't have a click function

2011-06-03T04:23:24  <barancev> I've started chromedriver.exe manually and opened http://localhost:9515/healthz in browser -- it gives 404 not found
2011-06-03T04:23:54  <barancev> may be it is the reason why ChromeDriver just polling healthz and can't start browser?
2011-06-03T04:25:38  <jarib> barancev: WFM. sounds like you have an old chromedriver.exe?
2011-06-03T04:26:29  * barancev went to download a new chromedriver again
2011-06-03T04:28:03  <jarib> lisak: so, from reading the .idl files in WebKit, only HTMLButtonElement and HTMLInputElement has a click() function
2011-06-03T04:28:28  <jarib> live and learn :)
2011-06-03T04:28:31  <barancev> oh, shit! it was not replaced with a new file because I've seven zoblie chromediver.exe processes!
2011-06-03T04:28:51  <jarib> barancev: what language binding are you using?
2011-06-03T04:29:00  <barancev> jarib: Java
2011-06-03T04:29:57  <jarib> sounds like they don't clean up properly
2011-06-03T04:30:18  <lisak> jarib, but how come that in Javascript one can place click handler on almost anything
2011-06-03T04:30:28  <lisak> listener/handler
2011-06-03T04:30:37  <lisak> is that a different story :) ?
2011-06-03T04:30:52  <lisak> than this
2011-06-03T04:31:14  <jarib> probably, because a click event can bubble up from the child
2011-06-03T04:31:26  <jarib> s/the/a
2011-06-03T04:31:48  <barancev> killed zombies, updated driver -- started now
2011-06-03T04:31:50  <jarib> lisak: if i were you, go back to WebElement.click
2011-06-03T04:32:01  <jarib> it's made to handle all these edge cases

2011-06-03T05:01:06  <barancev> jarib: I've found where zombies come from - if I close chrome browser window (when it is hanging), I get [0603/160845:ERROR:automation_proxy.cc(389)] Channel error in AutomationProxy.
2011-06-03T05:01:37  <barancev> jarib: but Java process has not terminated
2011-06-03T05:02:11  <barancev> jarib: and when I kill Java, googlechrome zombie appears

2011-06-03T05:04:14  <jarib> if it disappears, then all is well, no?
2011-06-03T05:04:29  <jarib> oh, appears
2011-06-03T05:05:14  <barancev> yes, chromedriver remains running
2011-06-03T05:05:19  <jarib> barancev: if you forcefully kill java, then quit() isn't called
2011-06-03T05:05:33  <jarib> and quit() is where the chromedriver is stopped
2011-06-03T05:05:48  <jarib> in ruby, i have an at_exit hook that kills chromedriver
2011-06-03T05:05:59  <barancev> I know, but.. what is the best way to deal with hanging chrome browser?
2011-06-03T05:06:15  <jarib> where is it hanging?
2011-06-03T05:06:25  <jarib> (brb)
2011-06-03T05:06:50  <barancev> in Java it is possible to use shutdownHook, but there is #1637

2011-06-03T05:46:26  <AutomatedTester> well he has asked for .NET automation

2011-06-03T05:46:38  <RossPatterson> jimevans: As in, tests written in C# for the RC API?  I could probably share a couple.
2011-06-03T05:46:41  <AutomatedTester> ASP.NET
2011-06-03T05:46:43  <jimevans> yeah, i saw that, but assumed he meant asp.net.
2011-06-03T05:47:04  <jimevans> possibly bad assumption on my part.
2011-06-03T05:47:24  <Binken> Jimevans, In the .net bings, the chromeservice cmd window, I think it should be hidden
2011-06-03T05:47:32  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: well if they went to adamgoucher then maybe its a safe assumption
2011-06-03T05:48:59  <jimevans> on the other hand, if it's desktop apps they're looking for, the twin project might be worth looking at. (http://code.google.com/p/twin)

2011-06-03T06:54:25  <Binken> :-|
2011-06-03T06:54:28  <RossPatterson> RC's getText is implemented in selenium-api.js, and uses getText() from htmlutils.js to extract the actual text from the located element.
2011-06-03T06:54:41  <Binken> I am using the new Chrome
2011-06-03T06:54:49  <Binken> And the chromeservice

2011-06-03T07:07:22  <simonstewart> ok
2011-06-03T07:07:35  <simonstewart> really, that should be "id"
2011-06-03T07:07:46  <jimevans> the json parameters can pass in a property "element", but it being null. that's allowed by the wire protocol.
2011-06-03T07:07:48  <simonstewart> Because that's how we always refer to the element elsewhere
2011-06-03T07:07:56  <simonstewart> yes, that's fine
2011-06-03T07:08:07  <simonstewart> If null is passed in, the last recorded mouse position is used
2011-06-03T07:08:43  <jimevans> elementId is null if null is provided by the json object's "element" property.
2011-06-03T07:08:55  <simonstewart> ok
2011-06-03T07:08:56  <jimevans> you need a null check.
2011-06-03T07:09:17  <simonstewart> Ahhh,....
2011-06-03T07:09:18  <jimevans> so that elementProvided will be false if the element property is null.
2011-06-03T07:09:21  <simonstewart> Good catch

2011-06-03T08:14:07  <simonstewart> same name as the directory
2011-06-03T08:15:09  <jimevans> so, for instance, ./go //dotnet would be the same as ./go //dotnet:dotnet (assuming a task of dotnet was defined in dotnet/build.desc)

2011-06-03T08:43:42  <AutomatedTester> even though I apparently last touched it
2011-06-03T08:43:57  <polm> Well, it obviously disagrees with the intro doc page:
2011-06-03T08:43:59  <AutomatedTester> polm: have you seen the example on pypi?
2011-06-03T08:44:07  <polm> Noooo
2011-06-03T08:44:13  <polm> Can you toss me a link?

2011-06-03T08:44:42  <polm> Ah, thanks
2011-06-03T08:44:44  <AutomatedTester> polm: what intro doc page?
2011-06-03T08:45:09  <polm> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PythonBindings
2011-06-03T08:45:22  *** rbalent has quit IRC
2011-06-03T08:45:53  <AutomatedTester> wheres the link to the example in that wiki page?
2011-06-03T08:45:56  <AutomatedTester> i cant see it
2011-06-03T08:47:00  <polm> No link, it just came up on google searches
2011-06-03T08:47:06  <rpk> Which jar should I be using from the Selenium/trunk/build/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium directory for java client tests?
2011-06-03T08:47:22  <AutomatedTester> polm: interesting the pypi page never came up
2011-06-03T08:47:31  <rpk> client-combined-standalone?
2011-06-03T08:47:36  <AutomatedTester> since thats how you install it
2011-06-03T08:47:59  <polm> Indeed. I must have been looking for the wrong thing... Could be I was using "webdriver" but not "selenium"
2011-06-03T08:48:22  <AutomatedTester> polm: i dont understand the question
2011-06-03T08:48:39  <polm> Not a question
2011-06-03T08:48:58  <AutomatedTester> ok, dont understand the statement
2011-06-03T08:50:20  <polm> I googled "webdriver python", and the pypi page for selenium is not in the first ten hits.
2011-06-03T08:51:38  <AutomatedTester> eranm: hey

2011-06-03T09:14:51  <polm> This is an EC2 node that came up minimally installed.
2011-06-03T09:15:40  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-06-03T09:15:48  <AutomatedTester> so you need a minimum of python 2.6, Selenium 2rc2 and Firefox to have a display
2011-06-03T09:15:58  <polm> And Xvfb
2011-06-03T09:16:16  <AutomatedTester> or Xvfb

2011-06-03T09:19:21  <polm> Ah, I think I forgot to export DISPLAY.
2011-06-03T09:19:26  <polm> Thanks!

2011-06-03T09:20:51  <eranm> You could use Xvlc + vnc2flv to record videos of the test.
2011-06-03T09:21:00  <simonstewart> which is basically what we do
2011-06-03T09:21:14  <polm> Aaaah, that sounds nice

2011-06-03T09:21:35  <simonstewart> We found out that there's a bug in xvnc that firefox tickles from time to time
2011-06-03T09:21:41  <simonstewart> Much hilarity debugging that
2011-06-03T09:21:44  <polm> But that sounds nice

2011-06-03T10:22:25  <polm> So I'm trying to write a test that clicks all the links on a page and makes sure none of them are 404/500 pages.
2011-06-03T10:22:40  <polm> Is there a particular appropriate way to do this?
2011-06-03T10:22:53  <polm> The way I'm doing it now I click the first link, go back, click the second, etc.
2011-06-03T10:23:06  <polm> selenium.common.exceptions.StaleElementReferenceException: Element not found in the cache
2011-06-03T10:23:10  <polm> but ^^^ happens
2011-06-03T10:23:29  <jimevans> are you attempting to find all of the links first, then clicking on each one?
2011-06-03T10:23:52  <polm> Yes, I found them using elem = browser.find_elements_by_tag_name("a")
2011-06-03T10:23:55  <jimevans> if so, you're seeing exactly what I'd expect you to.
2011-06-03T10:24:01  <eranm> bye all.
2011-06-03T10:24:07  *** eranm has quit IRC
2011-06-03T10:24:23  <jimevans> the second you navigate to a new page, any element references from the old page aren't valid anymore.
2011-06-03T10:24:39  <polm> That makes sense, but what should I be doing - iterating by number?
2011-06-03T10:24:45  <polm> Or can I open links in a new window/tab?
2011-06-03T10:25:30  <freynaud> you can also have something else checking the link, you do,n't need the browser to do it
2011-06-03T10:26:04  <jimevans> that's true.
2011-06-03T10:26:07  <polm> Ah, excellent point.
2011-06-03T10:26:07  <freynaud> use selenium to go to your page and get the link. Then do a simple get on the href found and check the result, without leaving the page
2011-06-03T10:26:21  <freynaud> hoping you don't have a log out link or something like that
2011-06-03T10:26:34  <polm> Well, there is one of those...
2011-06-03T10:26:44  <polm> It can be excluded.
2011-06-03T10:26:58  <freynaud> checking all the link only workis if the link do not impact the state of your page.
2011-06-03T10:27:12  <polm> Only the logout link should be stateful.
2011-06-03T10:27:24  <freynaud> if one of the link is "delete my credit card on file" clicking it will pchange the rest of your test
2011-06-03T10:27:38  <polm> Nope.
2011-06-03T10:27:46  <XCulver> if you can store the link in a list
2011-06-03T10:27:50  <polm> Also, I could use xpath to select all links in a given div, yes?
2011-06-03T10:27:54  <XCulver> and set the url to the link instead
2011-06-03T10:28:28  <XCulver> if they are just navigation links
2011-06-03T10:28:47  <jimevans> if all you're interested in is the absence of a 404 or 500 error code, i'd use freynaud's method.
2011-06-03T10:29:37  <jimevans> this in keeping with Evans' First Law of Automation (avoid driving the browser unless it's absolutely necessary)
2011-06-03T10:29:42  <freynaud> check all the link looks nice on paper, but I don't see a lot of value to doing it automatically. Either the link is important, and i don't want it to be a non 500, i want it to go to the right place so i want some validation
2011-06-03T10:29:50  <polm> Well, we have many links that just fire some js
2011-06-03T10:29:53  <freynaud> either I don't really care, and I don't automate it
2011-06-03T10:30:28  <polm> Well, the interface is unfortunately too unstable to start writing tests with confirmation.
2011-06-03T10:30:29  <freynaud> + if you site is badly design, with link + css to create input etc, you'll have so many exception to handle that you won't save time

2011-06-03T12:50:51  <phdaemon> yo gents, quick question
2011-06-03T12:52:05  <phdaemon> Im using grid, and I have 3 environments with 10 rcs. One mac, one windows one linux. Sometimes when im executing tests on them from the grid server (running linux as well) I get the awesomely descriptive No sessionId provided. Most likely your original newBrowserSession command failed..
2011-06-03T12:52:20  <phdaemon> error, and some other times it works fine
2011-06-03T12:52:29  <phdaemon> like i have to keep restarting the grid and or the RC servers....
2011-06-03T12:52:32  <phdaemon> what could be causing this?

2011-06-03T13:06:53  <Archdude> is the Format function in Se IDE 1.0.11 broken?
2011-06-03T13:11:55  <ubitsa|work> From the release notes:        Format changing is now marked as experimental due to possibleissues, you can turn it on from the options dialog (Samit Badle)
2011-06-03T13:11:55  <ubitsa|work> In other words do to Add-Ons -> Selenium -> Options and check "Enable experimental features"
2011-06-03T13:12:04  <ubitsa|work> that's from the dev list
2011-06-03T13:12:05  <adamgoucher> i think it is marked as experimental now or something (samit did it that release)
