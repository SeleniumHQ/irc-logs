2011-07-26T00:41:11  <pngl> CSS selectors behave strangely with IE7. Is that a known problem?
2011-07-26T00:42:26  <pngl> More precisely: doing "#some-id select" will in some cases return another select than the correct one. Also, doing "#some-other-id .classA.classB" will give me all the document's element which have classA and classB.

2011-07-26T00:53:06  <ArmEagle> pngl the latter seems obvious to me. (depending on what function you use the selector in I guess)
2011-07-26T00:53:49  <ArmEagle> with the first. assuming it's a normal CSS selector, don't you mean select#some-id, or is the select actually a (sub) child of #some-id
2011-07-26T00:54:17  <ArmEagle> - I'm still new to Selenium myself. But these seem basic CSS things to me, I could be wrong
2011-07-26T00:54:21  <pngl> ArmEagle: I thought the latter meant "all descendants of #some-other-id that have classA and classB"
2011-07-26T00:54:39  <pngl> ArmEagle: and that the former meant "all selects that are descendants of #some-id"
2011-07-26T00:54:43  <ArmEagle> oh sorry all document's.. i misread :)
2011-07-26T00:54:55  *** mdirkse has joined #selenium
2011-07-26T00:55:39  <ArmEagle> I guess I'd have to look into the function used with those selectors then. But can't look at it right now. Hopefully someone else will be of real help :)
2011-07-26T00:56:57  <pngl> ArmEagle: what do you mean by "the function used with those selectors"
2011-07-26T00:58:27  <ArmEagle> well, I assume you feed that CSS selector to some function of a Selenium part. OR is this just generic CSS styles you have issues with?
2011-07-26T00:59:41  <pngl> ArmEagle: I'm just doing find_element and then checking some things about those elements. But what I am checking is immaterial here I think since the wrong elements are returned in the first place.

2011-07-26T04:07:57  <angshu> simonstewart: hi simon. how often do you guys plan to do major releases?
2011-07-26T04:08:11  <simonstewart> How'd you mean?
2011-07-26T04:08:41  <simonstewart> The version numbering goes "major"."minor"."language specific"
2011-07-26T04:08:54  <simonstewart> The next major release will be 3.x.x
2011-07-26T04:09:00  <angshu> sorry .. minor releases .. as in 2.2 is just out. tentative interval .. like 2.3 for example
2011-07-26T04:09:13  <simonstewart> We're pushing for weekly releases
2011-07-26T04:09:52  <simonstewart> Once the initial adoption of 2.x slows and the rate of bug fixes slows too, we'll drop down to two week or monthly releases
2011-07-26T04:10:08  <simonstewart> But the plan is to get to at least 2.4 with a weekly release
2011-07-26T04:11:03  <simonstewart> If there are no hitches, 2.3 should be out on next Monday
2011-07-26T04:11:05  <angshu> ok. so would we expect something like major.minor[.build] ?
2011-07-26T04:11:11  <angshu> post 2.4
2011-07-26T04:11:19  <simonstewart> The last version number is reserved for the specific languages
2011-07-26T04:11:31  <simonstewart> So 2.3 will be the same for all languages
2011-07-26T04:11:48  <simonstewart> But (for example) the ruby bindings might have a couple of minor bug fixes so be at 2.3.2
2011-07-26T04:12:13  <simonstewart> while java won't have any, so might still be 2.3.0
2011-07-26T04:12:46  <angshu> and the same 2.3.2 will be compatible with java 2.3.0
2011-07-26T04:14:27  <angshu> got it .. thanks a ton.

2011-07-26T05:51:34  <pngl> Is there documentation about the parameters webdriver adds to IE when it launches it? I'm dealing with strange things on IE7 that I can't reproduce if IE wasn't launched by Selenium.
2011-07-26T05:52:02  <simonstewart> It just fires up the IE control
2011-07-26T05:52:51  <RossPatterson> Mox[NL]: Despite TestNg's support for it, lots of folks in the testing community think that dependent tests are a really bad idea.

2011-07-26T05:56:06  <RossPatterson> Mox[NL]: Among other reasons, because it makes it difficult to run tests independently.  And there's a school of thought that says your test order should be randomized occasionally, so as to avoid following a too-predictable pattern that might hide latent bugs.

2011-07-26T06:09:53  <pngl> simonstewart: at first glance, it seems that popup windows do not carry cookie information with them, ie if I login on domain X in window A, then from A I open the popup B and go to domain X, I won't be logged in.
2011-07-26T06:10:11  <simonstewart> Sounds odd
2011-07-26T06:10:34  <jarib> speaking of atoms, i should file a bug for the mootools issue

2011-07-26T06:10:53  <simonstewart> If you're setting cookies via the normal mechanisms (that is, not via the webdriver apis) things should be stored in the cookie jar

2011-07-26T06:20:31  <jarib> jimevans: unrelated, but IE seems to have custom error codes for alert errors
2011-07-26T06:21:05  <jimevans> jarib: you mean the status code returned by the driver?
2011-07-26T06:21:24  <simonstewart> jimevans: simonstewart: at first glance, it seems that popup windows do not carry cookie information with them, ie if I login on domain X in window A, then from A I open the popup B and go to domain X, I won't be logged in.
2011-07-26T06:21:24  <ato> 21:16 < ato> The by string passed by remote web driver is different to the one used in the atoms.  An example is that we have "partial link text"  in the remote web driver code, and "partialLinkText" in the WebDriver atoms code.  We also seem to pass around a lot of strings inside  of the remote driver.
2011-07-26T06:21:29  <ato> 21:16 < ato> Is there either a plan for using some other way of passing these strings around that would support both, or a functionality anywhere  for converting from one to the other?

2011-07-26T07:51:59  <simonstewart> 'sup?
2011-07-26T07:52:39  <jimevans> i'm trying to automate the nuget package creation which it would make sense to tack onto the "//dotnet:release" target.
2011-07-26T07:52:54  <jimevans> ($/dotnet/build.desc for those keeping score at home)
2011-07-26T07:53:00  <simonstewart> k
2011-07-26T07:53:28  <jimevans> ideally, what i'd like to do is define additional attributes onto the regular build tasks for the .net assemblies that provide the nuget-specific information.
2011-07-26T07:53:51  <jimevans> (package id, title, description, and so on)
2011-07-26T07:53:56  <simonstewart> Which is easy enough to do
2011-07-26T07:54:09  <jimevans> the regular build tasks are dependencies of the release task
2011-07-26T07:54:11  <simonstewart> Any key you add to a build rule appears as a key to the args hash passed in to handle
2011-07-26T07:54:54  <jimevans> right. but can I get to those keys from within a dependent task?
2011-07-26T07:55:07  <jimevans> i think the answer is no at present.
2011-07-26T07:55:35  <simonstewart> If you reference that task in the lexical scope of "args" you can
2011-07-26T07:55:41  <simonstewart> (sorry: define)
2011-07-26T07:56:04  <jimevans> yeah, i'm not in the same lexical scope, though.
2011-07-26T07:56:26  <simonstewart> Then, no
2011-07-26T07:56:33  <jimevans> i think what i have to do is subclass the albacore csc task, and add the additional attributes into it, so that I can reference them in the dependent task
2011-07-26T07:56:51  <simonstewart> Possibl
2011-07-26T07:57:03  <simonstewart> Or declare the task in the body of a "handle"
2011-07-26T07:57:03  <jimevans> but that's where my ruby/rake ignorance is slowing me down.
2011-07-26T07:57:49  <jimevans> the motiviation for this is that every nuget package requires a "version" attribute.
2011-07-26T07:58:10  <jimevans> and I don't want to define that on every .net assembly build task (that's super redundant)

2011-07-26T07:58:39  <simonstewart> So just call "version()"

2011-07-26T08:29:15  <TuRNc04tZ> Im running selenium and im encountering an interesting issue: I have a URL that if i access directly in the browser, it runs fine (fast and smooth), however when i tell selenium to open it, its extremely slow (ONLY ON IE) why could that be the case?
2011-07-26T08:29:36  <TuRNc04tZ> Also may I add, i have enabled trust ALL certs and installed the CyberV Certs
2011-07-26T08:35:31  <jarib_> cerberos: Pretty sure you need to give it the path to an existing profile

2011-07-26T08:41:10  <TuRNc04tZ> im using selenium grid in jenkins but i upgraded it
2011-07-26T08:41:23  <TuRNc04tZ> the crazy thing is that in any other browser it works fine, except for firefox where it returns a -1 header
2011-07-26T08:41:38  <TuRNc04tZ> but i believe its because of the https certs not being installed in that profile, even tho every other site works
2011-07-26T08:41:45  <TuRNc04tZ> and when i access the site directly it also works

2011-07-26T10:05:16  <ruel> hi guys.  need some guidance on a best practice
2011-07-26T10:05:26  <ruel> i'm using webdriver with an implicit wait of 5 seconds
2011-07-26T10:05:36  *** cerberos has quit IRC
2011-07-26T10:05:37  <simonstewart> ok
2011-07-26T10:05:52  <ruel> i've implemented in iselementpresent method which uses find.by("someid");
2011-07-26T10:06:04  <ruel> it wraps it in a try/catch to determine if the element is present or not
2011-07-26T10:06:15  <ruel> the problem:   if i want to call iselement present 5 times
2011-07-26T10:06:20  <ruel> for elements that are not present
2011-07-26T10:06:31  <ruel> the implicit wait dictates that i'm waiting 50 seconds....
2011-07-26T10:06:36  <simonstewart> Yes
2011-07-26T10:06:43  <ruel> any other way around this?
2011-07-26T10:06:59  <simonstewart> Drop the implicit wait to 0 before entering the wait?
2011-07-26T10:07:15  <ruel> thats the only thing i could think of as well
2011-07-26T10:07:27  <simonstewart> The wait should wait _up to_ the time limit you specify
2011-07-26T10:07:32  <ruel> just wanted to double check and see if that's how you would  do it was well
2011-07-26T10:07:36  <simonstewart> So if you say "wait 20 seconds" it'll only do 4 checks
2011-07-26T10:07:45  <ruel> ok
2011-07-26T10:07:46  <ruel> makes sense
2011-07-26T10:07:56  <simonstewart> The other option would be to implement your own Wait class
2011-07-26T10:08:41  <ruel> thanks.   i'll give that a shot
2011-07-26T10:08:54  <ruel> i saw on the blog that 2.2.0 was released
2011-07-26T10:09:04  <ruel> and a comment indicated that the changelog was with the downloads
2011-07-26T10:09:10  <ruel> where is that at?

2011-07-26T10:37:04  <new2b2> when i do is_element_present or find_element_by_id (assuming other find_elements will be the same) and the element is NOT present, it takes a long time before it moves on to the next line
2011-07-26T10:37:11  <tunabum> jimevans: is there still a need to separate the downloads for C# (selenium RC) ~ which points to an old selenium-remote-control-1.0.3.zip  and the selenium-webdriver one (selenium-dotnet.2.2.0.zip)?
2011-07-26T10:37:38  <new2b2> it's like it timesout because it is looking for the element ( / waiting for it to come out)
2011-07-26T10:37:47  <tunabum> new2b2: do you have implicitly wait set?
2011-07-26T10:37:55  <new2b2> yes
2011-07-26T10:38:15  <tunabum> reset it to 0 if you expect the element to not exist
2011-07-26T10:38:21  <new2b2> i don't understand why it is used for 'is_element_present'
2011-07-26T10:38:46  <jimevans> tunabum: no, the selenium-dotnet-2.2.0.zip should contain everything anyone needs, including the RC api.

2011-07-26T10:43:07  <simonstewart> Was that a little harsh?
2011-07-26T10:43:41  <ner0x> Is it possible to get the xpath from an element object?
2011-07-26T10:43:52  <ner0x> Or at least some sort of identification so you can print what you are testing?
2011-07-26T10:44:01  <tunabum> simonstewart: i don't think so... you should also change the status to wontfix
2011-07-26T10:44:09  <simonstewart> Just did that :)
2011-07-26T10:44:26  <tunabum> nice :)
2011-07-26T10:44:39  <jimevans> simonstewart: i don't think it's harsh. the main issue i see is people want to select elements based on having text containing some value.
2011-07-26T10:44:47  <simonstewart> Right
2011-07-26T10:44:50  <jimevans> xpath provides that, css selectors don't.
2011-07-26T10:45:06  <ruel> yes, its one of the first discrepancies
2011-07-26T10:45:09  <jimevans> aside from the fact that it's a remarkably dumb way to select elements.
2011-07-26T10:45:11  <tunabum> i feel like i should provide a sample on the docs site of a By.sizzle impl
2011-07-26T10:45:14  <ruel> people will see when moving from selenium to webdriver
2011-07-26T10:45:16  <simonstewart> I can't believe that so many people want to use sizzle and aren't using jquery on their site
2011-07-26T10:45:33  <ner0x> jquery++
2011-07-26T10:45:42  <simonstewart> exactly. That's what everyone says
2011-07-26T10:45:50  <simonstewart> Do they not realise that jquery contains sizzle?
2011-07-26T10:46:55  <tunabum> most don't it seems... but I also have worked on many sites that use YUI or prototype instead
2011-07-26T10:47:12  <RossPatterson> simonstewart: Nope, nice and clear, while still polite.  Of course, I'm biased - I never liked the "Se uses Sizzle to do CSS, so try ...insert non-CSS thing here..." suggestions in the first place.
2011-07-26T10:47:13  * jimevans goes to find a power drill to put in his ear.
2011-07-26T10:47:18  <simonstewart> So why not use the locators from those libraries
2011-07-26T10:47:36  <simonstewart> RossPatterson: it's terrible advice
2011-07-26T10:48:51  <tunabum> yeah, i can do that just fine... i think the problem comes with the skillset of testers who don't know how to use javascript / those libraries
2011-07-26T10:49:14  <tunabum> and there's tons of examples on the interwebs with selenium and sizzle
2011-07-26T10:50:43  <simonstewart> True. Which is why the webdriver-backed selenium offers warnings
2011-07-26T10:52:15  <simonstewart> I might do a blog post about using sizzle directly
2011-07-26T10:52:25  <simonstewart> and how to write a custom locatoe
2011-07-26T10:52:32  <simonstewart> And then let people who are keen copy and paste
2011-07-26T10:52:38  * RossPatterson almost wants to patch /third_party/js/sizzle/sizzle.js to disable :contains, etc.
2011-07-26T10:52:44  <ner0x> Is there a way to reverse lookup an element?
2011-07-26T10:52:53  <ner0x> Say, if you have the element, get the xpath?
2011-07-26T10:52:55  <simonstewart> RossPatterson: that's a fine idea
2011-07-26T10:53:03  <simonstewart> ner0x: you'll need to do it via JS
2011-07-26T10:53:21  <simonstewart> adamgoucher: what do you think?
2011-07-26T10:53:37  <adamgoucher> which what?
2011-07-26T10:53:41  * adamgoucher scrolls up
2011-07-26T10:53:53  <simonstewart> Patch the sizzle library in third party to properly match the css subset
2011-07-26T10:54:09  <simonstewart> It'll clear up a lot of confusion
2011-07-26T10:54:37  <adamgoucher> i dunno. then you're supporting sizzle which you explicitly didn't want to do
2011-07-26T10:54:48  <simonstewart> The exact opposite
2011-07-26T10:54:56  <simonstewart> We're taking out of sizzle the bits that aren't in the css spec
2011-07-26T10:55:11  <adamgoucher> oh
2011-07-26T10:55:16  <simonstewart> So "css" in selenium 1 means "use css" and _not_ "use sizzle"
2011-07-26T10:55:40  <adamgoucher> i think its a communication thing. i need to fix the blog post i have for sauce as part of that

2011-07-26T11:01:15  <simonstewart> we already give a warning if we detect badness
2011-07-26T11:01:35  * RossPatterson checks http://selenium.saucelabs.com/irc/logs/selenium.yyyy-mm-dd.log every morning.
2011-07-26T11:02:08  <adamgoucher> exactly. leave things as they are in the webdriver side of things, but start to guide peopele who are using ide/rc to the dom solution for sizzly stuffs
2011-07-26T11:02:23  <simonstewart> Hmph.
2011-07-26T11:02:33  <simonstewart> Am very tempted to rename "css=" in selenium 1 to "sizzle"
2011-07-26T11:02:48  <simonstewart> and add a "real" "css" that by default uses the mechanism used by webdriver
2011-07-26T11:03:39  <adamgoucher> that would work too
2011-07-26T11:04:42  <adamgoucher> if css= detects badness then it drops to sizzle= and emits a warning. and then in a could releases just doesn't work (with a sterner message)

2011-07-26T11:09:39  <cgp_> if you were going to give a general presentation on selenium to people about how selenium works, and writing tests, what would you emphasize?

2011-07-26T11:11:02  <cgp_> other than css != sizzle :)
2011-07-26T11:11:05  <RossPatterson> cgp_: Last time I did that, I emphasized the idea that the test script and the application under test are two separate programs running independently, and that much of the test script's job is to ensure that at certain points they're both in sync.
2011-07-26T11:11:18  <RossPatterson> Oh, and Thou Shalt Never Thread.Sleep().
2011-07-26T11:11:30  <adamgoucher> its /just/ a library to drive a browser. thats it. thats all. any 'test' magic comes from the runner and how you use it
2011-07-26T11:11:40  <RossPatterson> True dat.
2011-07-26T11:12:15  <cgp_> true, your point being it could be an automation platform for all it's worth

2011-07-26T12:24:15  <lord1234> but definitely isn't great at finding absolute xpath
2011-07-26T12:24:48  <lord1234> would you prefer ".//*[@id='addon-summary']/div/div/div/p/a/span"  or //span[text()='Add to Firefox']

2011-07-26T15:57:49  <jimevans> jarib: what is the common coding style regarding omitting parentheses in ruby code?
2011-07-26T16:05:14  <jarib> jimevans: none, really. more a question of personal taste
2011-07-26T16:07:01  <jimevans> ok. thanks. and since simon's not around, does crazy fun support line continuation in build.desc files?
2011-07-26T16:07:14  <jimevans> (i'm guessing no, but i've not yet tried it)
2011-07-26T16:07:25  <jarib> i like to always use parentheses in method definitions
2011-07-26T16:07:36  <jarib> i don't know

2011-07-26T16:08:16  <jimevans> I'm not sure what the mechanism is for parsing build.desc files. it's black majick to me.
2011-07-26T16:08:41  <jarib> it's a ragel-generated parser
2011-07-26T16:09:14  <jimevans> then i'm going to go on the assumption it doesn't know how to do line continuation. :)
2011-07-26T16:09:32  <jarib> the grammar is in the .rl files in rake-tasks/crazy-fun

2011-07-26T18:39:44  <ner0x>   //div[@id="myID"]//span[text()="Close"] for example?
2011-07-26T18:42:26  <gordolio> ner0x: yes.
2011-07-26T18:42:46  <gordolio> you can also couple it with another attribute...
2011-07-26T18:46:21  <gordolio> //div[@id="myID"]//span[text()="Close" and @name='foo']

2011-07-26T18:48:07  <gordolio> I'm looking for the definitive source for webdriver commands...
2011-07-26T18:48:26  <gordolio> working on the perl implementation of Selenium::Remote::Driver...
2011-07-26T18:48:52  <gordolio> and I've got a test to verify that what we have in Commands.pm matches what is published...
2011-07-26T18:49:26  <gordolio> I'm pulling from the JsonWireProtocol page... but it appears as though this is outdated...
2011-07-26T18:54:19  <ner0x> gordolio: This is fswitalski, I believe I've spoken with you over github a few times.
2011-07-26T18:54:41  <gordolio> oh, ok.
2011-07-26T18:55:14  <ner0x> I was planning a server_is_running util like the first selenium module had... or did you already implement this?
2011-07-26T18:55:18  * ner0x hasn't seen it yet.
2011-07-26T18:55:44  <gordolio> I haven't implemented it yet.
2011-07-26T18:56:03  <ner0x> Want me to give it a whirl?
2011-07-26T18:56:08  <gordolio> sure that would be awesome.
2011-07-26T18:56:18  <ner0x> What namespace would you like it to be under?
2011-07-26T18:56:28  <gordolio> is there a ping check test already?
2011-07-26T18:56:48  <ner0x> To be honest I haven't checked into the tests too thoroughly yet.

2011-07-26T18:58:06  <gordolio> well...
2011-07-26T18:58:14  <gordolio> it's in the test...
2011-07-26T18:58:27  <gordolio> but it's also in the Selenium::Remote::RemoteConnection module as well.
2011-07-26T18:59:25  <ner0x> What is that module?!

2011-07-26T19:00:05  <ner0x> Oh, I'd rather have something that dies gracefully.
2011-07-26T19:00:20  <ner0x> So you can plan a test_skip or something like that around it.

2011-07-26T19:03:11  <gordolio> not sure if this is the best way to do this but...
2011-07-26T19:03:38  <gordolio> you could put it in a Test::Selenium::Remote::Driver namespace...
2011-07-26T19:04:31  <gordolio> eval{Selenium::Remote::Driver->new;}; if($@ eq 'Selenium RC server is not responding) {skip_all "no server running";}
2011-07-26T19:04:58  <gordolio> lemme send you what I have for the namespace so far...
2011-07-26T19:05:04  <gordolio> you asked me for it before...
2011-07-26T19:05:25  <ner0x> Right right, I just ended up writing my own bindings for tests like you suggested. :-)
2011-07-26T19:07:20  <ner0x> gordolio: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/126475 I just did something like this and use it for everything.
2011-07-26T19:09:06  <ner0x> http://paste.scsys.co.uk/126476   This is my entire test module.
