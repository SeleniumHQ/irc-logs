2011-08-31T05:43:35  <AutomatedTester> can we fix it?
2011-08-31T05:43:40  <jimevans> not easily.
2011-08-31T05:43:45  <Rune_> I'm having trouble running remote tests against IE8 on Win Server 2k8.
2011-08-31T05:44:23  <jimevans> we could spawn different threads for the execution, but there are all sorts of synchronization issues that you hit then.
2011-08-31T05:44:27  <Rune_> "Protected Mode must be set to the same value (enabled or disabled) for all zones." But I thiught I had done that already
2011-08-31T05:44:46  <jimevans> plus marshalling com objects across threads isn't exactly a picnic.
2011-08-31T05:45:10  <jimevans> Rune_: did you do that on the remote machine (the one running the selenium server)?
2011-08-31T05:45:32  <Rune_> jimevans: Yes. At least for some of the users.
2011-08-31T05:46:00  <Rune_> I'm running selenium java standalone as a service. Which user is that?
2011-08-31T05:46:02  <jimevans> how about the user who's logged in for the session that the selenium server runs on?
2011-08-31T05:46:54  <jimevans> I've never tested running the selenium server as a service. i have no idea if that will work.
2011-08-31T05:47:22  <AutomatedTester> Rune_: you can set the user in the service menu
2011-08-31T05:47:26  <Rune_> It works with FF :-) But i'll try running it manually by a user then..

2011-08-31T05:47:53  <jimevans> Firefox isn't directly tied into the currently logged in user the way IE is.

2011-08-31T06:11:01  <jimevans> but there's still a bug in the ie driver, i think.
2011-08-31T06:11:11  <jimevans> or at least in the java bindings.
2011-08-31T06:13:21  <Rune_> Hurrah! It works now :D This will save us loads of time doing regression tests against all supported browsers.
2011-08-31T06:14:10  <Rune_> Does webdriver use IE9's compatibility mode to emulate IE8 and IE7 behaviour?
2011-08-31T06:14:51  <jimevans> no. the IE driver makes no attempt to emulate any behaviour other than the version it's actually running against.
2011-08-31T06:15:22  <Rune_> Ok, so if I need to test against both 7 and 8, I need different windows installations?
2011-08-31T06:15:33  <jimevans> yes. virtual machines, FTW.
2011-08-31T06:16:06  <Rune_> ok
2011-08-31T06:16:48  <jimevans> If you are using the Microsoft Virtual PC stack, you can use http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11575

2011-08-31T09:08:19  <jarib> cucumber is more for acceptance/large tests where you also want the business side involved (e.g. describe functionality in plain text)
2011-08-31T09:08:48  <jarib> rspec is more a unit test framework (but could of course be used for any code, including browser tests)

2011-08-31T10:16:21  <SMaction> Hi  I am really new to selenium.  I created a script using the IDE and it runs correctly (if I set speed to slow). I exported to JAVA and it timesout when I test if from Eclipse.  The page has AJAX on it so it appears that the script "gets ahead" of the page and executes a click command (but watching in the browser nothing happens) and then it cannot find the next element.  I have pasted the
2011-08-31T10:16:21  <SMaction> code here http://pastebin.com/ACgJtRkz
2011-08-31T10:19:04  <Nogem> SMaction: can you paste the error in a bin?
2011-08-31T10:20:08  <Nogem> and did you do anything to compensate for "// ERROR: Caught exception [ERROR: Unsupported command [select]]"?
2011-08-31T10:22:45  <SMaction> on  the line 43 it errors out with element not visible.  no I did not but the script is not getting that far yet.
2011-08-31T10:22:58  <SMaction> I had not even noticed that one :(

2011-08-31T10:25:46  <Ajay> SMaction: use implicit waits than Thread.sleep
2011-08-31T10:27:06  <SMaction> Ajay: the export put in the following line  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS);  do I need to add that each place I want a wait or does that set it for the whole script?

2011-08-31T10:36:31  <SMaction> Ajay the explicit wait is not working correctly for me because the elements I am looking for are rendered from AJAX.  How else could the script progress succesfully past the line  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS); and then fail on the line   driver.findElement(By.id("obTable")).click(); ?
2011-08-31T10:36:54  <SMaction> oops I pasted the wrong lines
2011-08-31T10:37:19  <SMaction> first line of the two should have been   try { if (isElementPresent(By.id("obTable"))) break; } catch (Exception e) {}
2011-08-31T10:37:50  <SMaction> I feel really dense about all this because it seems like it should be pretty straight forward.

2011-08-31T10:47:38  <Ajay> SMaction: Explicit wait is to wait for an element
2011-08-31T10:48:06  <jqp> is there a way with selenium 2 to run ie9 in ie8 mode?
2011-08-31T10:48:16  <Ajay> the driver waits till the specific timeout and the condition is met

2011-08-31T10:51:21  <SMaction> Ajay: but those lines are in the code and yet it is not working.  I think something else is going on because I replaced the first few for loops with thread.sleep and it still will not go past the first click (although in this case the code is not timing out it is just hanging forever).  The site is a public site would you be willing to run the code I pasted and see if you see something
2011-08-31T10:51:21  <SMaction> different I am missing?

2011-08-31T11:11:43  <Parabola> afternoon guys
2011-08-31T11:14:59  <Parabola> i'm trying to implement testNG into my code
2011-08-31T11:15:11  <Parabola> and i'm reading the documentation, but i'm not finding what i'm looking for :-\
2011-08-31T11:15:41  <Parabola> i'd like to loop through methods
2011-08-31T11:19:25  <FroLock> you talking about repeating the same test with dif data? or just running the same test over and over

2011-08-31T11:26:11  <Parabola> different data
2011-08-31T11:26:45  <Parabola> currently i've got a single method that takes a cmdline arg and sets the driver off of that. i'd love to use that to run against all the browsers i need to test with
2011-08-31T11:27:02  <Parabola> so, have testNG loop through that method giving it each browser, if that makes sense

2011-08-31T12:52:44  <jason____> Interestingly, after 4+ hours with 3 engineers, right after posting to this group I found a workaround, at least.  I set my preferences in firefox to manually proxy on port 4445, used that port when starting selenium and when connecting.  We still don't know why 4444 isn't working, but at least I can develop in the meantime.  Thank you, magic sounding board.

2011-08-31T15:59:42  <jarib> a fair amount, yes :)
2011-08-31T15:59:53  <mrchess> just wonderin if you'd recommend selenium for websocket testing
2011-08-31T16:00:35  <jarib> selenium doesn't really care what mechanism you use to talk to the server
2011-08-31T16:00:38  <mrchess> about to start my selenium journey as i am looking for a way to test the client with my nodejs/socket.io app... want to make sure i'm making a good choice

2011-08-31T16:01:05  <mrchess> ic
2011-08-31T16:01:43  <mrchess> i just git stalked u and notice u do a lot of work with watir
2011-08-31T16:01:47  <mrchess> do you like that more than selenium?
2011-08-31T16:02:13  <jarib> i started with watir, we have a lot of tests against that API
2011-08-31T16:02:49  <jarib> webdriver (part of selenium 2) provides much better browser autoamtion tech than watir, so i wrote watir-webdriver to get the watir api on top of the webdriver tech

2011-08-31T23:09:39  <PowerStat> I am using selenium ide 1.2.0 (same was with 1.1) and have problem or misunderstanding with the window/title commands:
2011-08-31T23:09:56  <PowerStat> 1: store 4711 pageId1
2011-08-31T23:10:12  <PowerStat> waitForAllWindowTitles glob:,digipen${pageId1}*.pdf (application/pdf-Objekt)

2011-08-31T23:10:47  <PowerStat> selectWindow ${windowIds}
2011-08-31T23:10:54  <PowerStat> the last one doesn't work
2011-08-31T23:11:52  *** lfryc has quit IRC
2011-08-31T23:12:09  <PowerStat> also I wonder why the waitforwindow titles only matches when I gave the "," looks to me like internally the window title is not correctly, because it should be a list like "window1, window2" or so - but looks more like ",window1, window2"
2011-08-31T23:13:01  <PowerStat> selectWindow glob:,digipen${pageId1}*.pdf (application/pdf-Objekt)         also doesn't work with or without the ","
2011-08-31T23:13:32  <PowerStat> or is there another way of identifying an new opened window with an not well known title?
