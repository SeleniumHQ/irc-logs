2011-09-22T05:47:41  <jqp> ...different flavors of workflows, and use TestNG the right way.  right now in that big test class i've got one primary method that dictates the workflow and calls other methods in the test class to execute and test more specific tasks, e.g. create a user, create an event, edit an event, etc.  in those auxiliary test methods, should i be passing in and returning page objects from/to the...
2011-09-22T05:47:43  <jqp> ...higher-level primary workflow method in the test class?

2011-09-22T05:49:37  <jqp> i guess i'm looking for an example of how test classes interact with multiple page objects in WebDriver/Java/TestNG
2011-09-22T05:49:53  <jqp> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects doesn't seem like enough here
2011-09-22T05:52:27  <krosenvold> jqp: I think you need to ask a question that someone will understand ;)
2011-09-22T05:52:52  <jqp> i was afraid of that
2011-09-22T05:53:34  <ian_mac_> generally you have page objects that return other page objects when you perform various actions
2011-09-22T05:54:49  <jqp> ian_mac_: right, i've got that part down.  my question is more about how to modularize a test class (e.g. a class that calls page objects and makes assertions)

2011-09-22T05:57:21  <ian_mac_> jqp: I haven't worked with Java and Selenium, but generally I keep tests short and small
2011-09-22T05:58:03  <jqp> ian_mac_: short and small, modular tests are exactly what i'm trying to move toward
2011-09-22T05:59:11  <jqp> i'd basically like to know how to get tests short and small as in http://testng.org/doc/selenium.html, but incorporating page objects
2011-09-22T05:59:26  <andreastt> amitev: You could write a handler around that to return a boolean type.
2011-09-22T05:59:43  <andreastt> amitev: But essentially there is no way of checking whether an element exists in the DOM before attempting to fetch it.
2011-09-22T05:59:50  <andreastt> amitev: So at some level you need to handle the exception.

2011-09-22T06:01:11  <jqp> amitev: yup, that's what i'm trying to do -- with page objects and testng
2011-09-22T06:01:22  <amitev> we create page objects to represent the application, code test cases that perform the steps and combine these test cases in a test scenario which is the actuall @Test class

2011-09-22T06:02:14  <amitev> the only thing testcases do is to call page objects, no selenium calls there
2011-09-22T06:02:42  <jqp> amitev: oh, do you have multiple methods annotated @Test within that 'test' class?  as in http://testng.org/doc/selenium.html?
2011-09-22T06:03:16  <jqp> (i realize issuing selenium.foo calls is bad practice.  imagine that example were using page objects.)
2011-09-22T06:04:07  <amitev> no
2011-09-22T06:04:18  <amitev> i have just one method called execute()
2011-09-22T06:04:26  <amitev> the only one public void method
2011-09-22T06:04:26  <jimevans> what issues are we still actively tracking for 2.7?
2011-09-22T06:04:38  <jqp> amitev: it sounds like i'm doing something very similar to your team -- i basically have one big @Test method that goes through a big, inflexible, non-modular workflow
2011-09-22T06:05:28  <amitev> jqp: these examples in the testng site are not good. they don't use page objects

2011-09-22T06:06:03  <amitev> jqp: actually its flexible and modular
2011-09-22T06:06:28  <amitev> the testcases which build the test scenario are reusable and could be combined into different scenarios
2011-09-22T06:07:07  <jqp> are these test cases isolated into separate methods from the main @Test method?
2011-09-22T06:07:31  <amitev> they're even in a separate classes outside the test scenario class (@Test class)

2011-09-22T07:01:57  <silastic> do you guys know if each firefox tab/windows has its own javascript thread or is it one global thead across everything?
2011-09-22T07:02:16  <simonstewart> One thread per frame
2011-09-22T07:02:27  <simonstewart> with no shared address space
2011-09-22T07:02:52  <silastic> so selenium could read window variables while the page its self is running some JS?
2011-09-22T07:03:21  <simonstewart> Nope
2011-09-22T07:03:37  <simonstewart> Though strictly speaking "it depends"
2011-09-22T07:03:42  *** stockton has joined #selenium
2011-09-22T07:04:23  <silastic> but if each frame has its own thread and selenium is running in a seperate frame from the test frame this would happen right?
2011-09-22T07:04:39  <simonstewart> Ahhh RC. It still depends
2011-09-22T07:04:45  <simonstewart> Which browser are you using?
2011-09-22T07:04:54  <RossPatterson> Not necessarily, and certainly not cross-browser.
2011-09-22T07:04:59  <silastic> Firefox 3.6 but I think i'm going to move to 4
2011-09-22T07:05:17  <simonstewart> Because in Firefox, we execute as an extension, so JS gets evaluated slightly differently
2011-09-22T07:05:39  <simonstewart> silastic: what problem are you actually trying to address?
2011-09-22T07:06:51  <silastic> basically I am writing some variables to the window object in the dom and then reading them from my java test code. They seem to get in an inconsistent state. I am trying to resolve this

2011-09-22T07:13:55  <RossPatterson> silastic: There's a good chance you're storing those variables in the wrong window object.  In Selenium RC, "window" doesn't necesarily mean what you think it does.
2011-09-22T07:14:27  <RossPatterson> silastic: If you want to use the application's window, try "selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().whatever" instead of "window.whatever".
2011-09-22T07:15:37  <silastic> RossPatterson: we can find the variables, they are just not what we think they should be exept during the execution of JS on the page

2011-09-22T07:38:33  <simonstewart> Where to?
2011-09-22T07:38:49  <Stuk> well, almost to your company, motorola/google :)
2011-09-22T07:38:55  <Stuk> and in California
2011-09-22T07:39:01  <andreastt> Anyone up for a challenge?  http://www.opera.com/company/jobs/opening/25/
2011-09-22T07:39:02  <simonstewart> Nice
2011-09-22T07:39:17  <andreastt> I have a nice office, and you get to sit next to me!
2011-09-22T07:39:29  <Stuk> ha :)
2011-09-22T07:40:24  <simonstewart> looks like fun
2011-09-22T07:40:48  <andreastt> I'm moving to a new apartment on 1 November, which is why I'm asking.  There are legal obligations to attend the meeting that day, so I need to investigate whether I can be there.
2011-09-22T07:41:00  <simonstewart> I still think that it'd be good to have people with implementation experience there
2011-09-22T07:41:23  <simonstewart> I'm flying back to London that evening on a 7pm flight
2011-09-22T07:41:38  <simonstewart> So I suspect that you'd be able to get back by 1st November
2011-09-22T07:41:43  <andreastt> That's true.  But it would be useful to have someone with experience with W3C standardization process there as well.
2011-09-22T07:41:46  <andreastt> Cool.
2011-09-22T07:42:30  <simonstewart> agreed

2011-09-22T07:50:19  <simonstewart> jimevans: "svn add" doesn't do what you want?

2011-09-22T07:51:39  <jimevans> i suppose it would, but i don't, strictly speaking, want to add it. somebody already did, and when doing "svn up", svn sees it and says it can't add the directory because an unversioned one already exists.
2011-09-22T07:51:50  <simonstewart> __gotcha: using the Actions class, yes
2011-09-22T07:52:10  <simonstewart> I'd move the directory out of the way, do the svn up
2011-09-22T07:52:14  <jimevans> ah. the --force flag i think is what i want.
2011-09-22T07:52:19  <simonstewart> then copy the ".svn" directory
2011-09-22T07:52:24  <simonstewart> Or you could force it

2011-09-22T08:12:17  <simonstewart> that's a very low-level interface
2011-09-22T08:12:19  <jimevans> simonstewart: trying to get a jump on things here, so let me know if i'm being premature. ie emulation test and test_ie pass for ie6
2011-09-22T08:12:20  <lord1234> he asked about mouseDown/mouseUp
2011-09-22T08:12:22  <simonstewart> The Actions one is really what you need
2011-09-22T08:12:27  <simonstewart> I know

2011-09-22T08:12:58  <simonstewart> the only time most people should care about Mouse and Keyboard is if they're either implementing them or adding a new action that doesn't currently exist

2011-09-22T08:17:11  <lord1234> why are you using RC?
2011-09-22T08:17:23  <lord1234> can I play "jimevans" in this dialogue?
2011-09-22T08:17:33  <__gotcha> lord1234: because the library I am using does so
2011-09-22T08:17:37  <simonstewart> You can, but be nice
2011-09-22T08:17:50  <lord1234> which library are you using?

2011-09-22T08:18:27  <lord1234> why not just use the python webdriver?
2011-09-22T08:18:45  <lord1234> jim, to play this role correctly, I'll need your social security number and mothers maiden name.  kthx
2011-09-22T08:18:47  <__gotcha> cause I want robotframework features
2011-09-22T08:19:10  <lord1234> what features does it provide?
2011-09-22T08:19:20  <__gotcha> cucumber like acceptance testing
2011-09-22T08:19:21  <lord1234> that you can't make yoruself....
2011-09-22T08:19:32  <lord1234> so basically a DDL?

2011-09-22T08:20:00  <__gotcha> I am ready to overhaul seleniumlibrary
2011-09-22T08:20:06  <__gotcha> by not using selenium RC
2011-09-22T08:20:07  <simonstewart> Heh. That's always a problem
2011-09-22T08:20:26  <simonstewart> __gotcha: how about layering on an abstraction that you can use over rc?
2011-09-22T08:20:44  <__gotcha> simonstewart: not sure I understand what you mean
2011-09-22T08:21:09  <RossPatterson> __gotcha: You started this by asking if Selenium 2 supported mouseMove.  As long as you're staying with the Selenium RC API, the answer is "Yes".
2011-09-22T08:21:27  <__gotcha> hi Ross
2011-09-22T08:22:35  <__gotcha> then I asked if I had a chance to simulate mouve down followed by mousemove followed by mouseup

2011-09-22T08:25:33  <simonstewart> __gotcha: you never need to use the raw API. You can always just write the ideal abstraction you want to use in your tests over it
2011-09-22T08:25:41  <simonstewart> where "it" is "selenium" in this case
2011-09-22T08:26:10  <jimevans> jarib: we're using the atom under the covers for getAttribute, so i'm not sure how that would be so.
2011-09-22T08:26:43  <__gotcha> simonstewart: true
2011-09-22T08:27:02  <jimevans> jarib: anything's possible, of course, but i've not seen the issue.
2011-09-22T08:27:07  <__gotcha> nevertheless when I send MouseMove to RC I do not see anything moving
2011-09-22T08:27:23  <simonstewart> You won't
2011-09-22T08:27:27  <simonstewart> it just fires the JS events
2011-09-22T08:27:28  <silastic> hi all, we have switched from selenium rc to web driver just now, and it can't use selenium.browserbot any more.... what should we change it to in order to access the window object of the application under test?
2011-09-22T08:27:40  <simonstewart> Just use "window"
2011-09-22T08:27:55  <simonstewart> If you're executing javascript then the JavascriptExecutor is the interface to use
2011-09-22T08:27:55  <jarib> jimevans: this is using execute_script to call getAttributeNode, it's not a bug in webdriver. was just hoping you would have some insights
2011-09-22T08:28:02  <simonstewart> (just cast your WebDriver to it)
2011-09-22T08:28:06  <jimevans> oh.
2011-09-22T08:28:27  <silastic> ah oops of course, since switching driver it's not using our profile template any more hence our FF extension isn't there to set the var!
2011-09-22T08:28:28  <jarib> or an alternative way of checking whether an attribute is defined
2011-09-22T08:28:33  <jimevans> ah. i see.
2011-09-22T08:28:49  <jarib> perhaps there's something in our atoms i could use

2011-09-22T08:32:49  <simonstewart> True. True
2011-09-22T08:33:05  <Wyccant> If it weren't for the fact I'd actually like to know the software better I'd pass it back to my manager and tell him to get a java coder to do it
2011-09-22T08:33:13  <simonstewart> I once got put on an air-gapped network because my team and I had specific software requests
2011-09-22T08:33:39  <simonstewart> The next step will be write a test suite (which I think you've done) and compile everything up
2011-09-22T08:33:53  <simonstewart> Once that's done, you can just run it using junit's text runner
2011-09-22T08:33:58  <Wyccant> yup, got that far last night. all compiled as classes
2011-09-22T08:34:07  <simonstewart> Ohhh...

2011-09-22T08:36:06  <simonstewart> The only tricky thing in there is the class name
2011-09-22T08:36:20  <simonstewart> From memory, you didn't have a package declaration at the top of your TestSuite class
2011-09-22T08:36:45  <simonstewart> In that case, and assuming your TestSuite is in a class called "TestSuite.java" replace "com.yourcompany.TestSuite" with "TestSuite"

2011-09-22T08:38:06  <simonstewart> I recommend starting up the Android Driver on the device or emulator first :)
2011-09-22T08:39:23  <Wyccant> ok, I did move contents of out directory... sorry but working through what you said I am left with: java -classpath "c:\_selenium\tests\webdriver;c:\_selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.5.0.jar" junit.textui.TestRunner TestSuiteArtEvo

2011-09-22T08:42:45  <Wyccant> hang on
2011-09-22T08:42:46  <simonstewart> Is that in c:\_selenium\tests\webdriver?
2011-09-22T08:42:56  <simonstewart> There should be a file called TestSuiteArtEvo.class in that directory
2011-09-22T08:44:56  *** mcr_mfc has joined #selenium
2011-09-22T08:45:01  <Wyccant> yeah filename had rogue underscore in, checked in .java for what it should be and renamed it. now saying exception in thread "main" NoClassDefFoundError: TestSuiteArtEvo
2011-09-22T08:45:31  <simonstewart> Is there a TestSuiteArtEvo.class file anywhere?
2011-09-22T08:45:51  <Wyccant> yes, the underscore shouldn't have been in filename so I corrected it
2011-09-22T08:46:07  <simonstewart> And recompiled the class?
2011-09-22T08:46:33  <simonstewart> the name of the ".java" file and the class need to match.
2011-09-22T08:46:35  <Wyccant> do i need to, source file declares public class TestSuiteArtEvo
2011-09-22T08:46:58  <simonstewart> If you make any changes to the java, you need to recompile

2011-09-22T08:51:32  <jimevans> i'd honestly be rather surprised that the ie driver works at all in that regard.
2011-09-22T08:51:44  <simonstewart> Really?
2011-09-22T08:51:56  <jimevans> well, it's not totally broken.
2011-09-22T08:52:00  <simonstewart> heh
2011-09-22T08:52:15  <jimevans> but clicking on elements in a cross-domain frame presents some... challenges.
2011-09-22T08:53:02  <jimevans> ie provides no easy way to get absolute coordinates for an element in a frame.
2011-09-22T08:53:15  <jimevans> only relative to the upper-left of the dom.

2011-09-22T08:54:48  <simonstewart> It'd be a lot easier if we were a BHO
2011-09-22T08:54:58  <jimevans> if i had to pick one and only one issue i wanted MSFT to look at for the ie driver, that'd be the one i'd want them to look at.
2011-09-22T08:55:44  <jimevans> i agree, but becoming a bho requires admin elevation to install.
2011-09-22T08:55:47  <simonstewart> We should gather some specific requests and funnel them through as many MS souls as we can find
2011-09-22T08:56:05  <simonstewart> Which we've already demonstrated most people find hard to get
2011-09-22T08:56:33  <jimevans> if msft ever produces an 'official' ie driver, it'll probably be a bho.
2011-09-22T08:56:45  <simonstewart> true
2011-09-22T08:56:51  <jarib> jimevans: i can access the elements just fine, it's just this getAttributeNode thing that falls over

2011-09-22T11:22:17  <lord1234> one thing I'm sort of surprised by is that selenium does not have its own assertion/pass/fail/logging classes
2011-09-22T11:22:55  <lukeis> that's because it's an automation tool... not a testing framework ;)
2011-09-22T11:23:09  <lukeis> there are a few third party packages that have them

2011-09-22T11:29:32  *** LpSolit has left #selenium
2011-09-22T11:29:48  <lord1234> it can't
2011-09-22T11:29:56  <lord1234> (seriously, i've gone down that route too)
2011-09-22T11:30:14  <lord1234> instead, make the setting in your application profile to never put those boxes up, and just always save to a default location
2011-09-22T11:30:42  <emil_temp_nick> how about close the dialog box?
2011-09-22T11:31:30  <lord1234> nope

2011-09-22T11:31:43  <emil_temp_nick> i c. tnx
2011-09-22T11:32:11  <jqp> i've been looking for an example of how to structure selenium tests in a non-trivial web application when using WebDriver, Java, TestNG and page objects.  i've come across https://github.com/EmiteGWT/hablar/tree/53fb2804c3f3716f6f05efeba47d08451b499b91/test/com/calclab/hablar/selenium, which looks promising
2011-09-22T11:32:47  <lukeis> the other thing that I've heard of to handle those dialogs (haven't done myself since it appears to only work on windows) is to use autoit
2011-09-22T11:32:54  *** Binken_ has quit IRC
2011-09-22T11:32:55  <jqp> is that a good way to organize tests?
2011-09-22T11:34:02  <jqp> the most unusual thing to me is that it looks like none of the methods in the PageObject classes return other PageObjects
2011-09-22T11:34:58  *** Binken_ has joined #selenium
2011-09-22T11:35:35  <lukeis> yeah, that's what i first noticed after a cursory look
2011-09-22T11:37:35  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-09-22T11:37:50  <lukeis> fairly similar to what i've done though... creating my own "PageObject" class... but I didn't call it that (Overloaded term and all) made specific ones for types of pages... and what he has in there I have in utility / helper classes

2011-09-22T11:39:49  <lukeis> not really...

2011-09-22T11:40:50  <lord1234> yea my framework is proprietary
2011-09-22T11:41:26  <lukeis> here's my "framework" stuff that I use... open sourced https://github.com/rexhoffman/test-extensions

2011-09-22T13:20:00  <lord1234> muahaha there are ways to get contains
2011-09-22T13:20:04  <RossPatterson> Haven't seen one yet.  I know there's one for .NET, inspired by the Java one.  This is one of the things I don't like about the WebDriver API - it's kinda fractured and things happen differently and at different times for different languages.
2011-09-22T13:20:06  <lord1234> just get the element text, and parse the string
