2011-06-21T01:30:12  <vaidab> when testing my webapp manually and i get a confirm box (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1342388/syneto/good_conf_box_1.png), the browser renders it with an overlay, but when run with remotewebdriver the overlay is not present and the confirm is in a window (http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1342388/syneto/bad_conf_box_1.png), any idea why is this happening?
2011-06-21T01:30:41  <vaidab> same browser, firefox 4
2011-06-21T01:31:03  <vaidab> just the added user.js that is sent from remotewebdriver

2011-06-21T01:42:12  <vaidab> that is how firefox4 renders it
2011-06-21T01:43:57  <vaidab> just a plain confirm('message')
2011-06-21T01:44:27  <Binken> I don't know is this actually alert
2011-06-21T01:45:57  <vaidab> it is a confirm
2011-06-21T01:46:00  <vaidab> not an alert
2011-06-21T01:46:21  <vaidab> alert only has OK, confirm has OK and CANCEL
2011-06-21T01:46:41  <Binken> So it's not a div layer?
2011-06-21T01:46:54  <vaidab> no
2011-06-21T01:47:13  <vaidab> don;t you have firefox?
2011-06-21T01:47:17  <Binken> YES
2011-06-21T01:47:29  <vaidab> and if you put there a confirm(), check it out

2011-06-21T02:13:10  <vaidab> and can not acctept them?
2011-06-21T02:13:16  <vaidab> the tests stop
2011-06-21T02:13:32  <AutomatedTester> you're hitting a race condition in your JS?

2011-06-21T02:14:12  <vaidab> there is not race condition
2011-06-21T02:14:46  <vaidab> ok, but this happens only when working with remotewebdriver

2011-06-21T06:32:42  <Ivog> The answer is refactor :)
2011-06-21T06:32:59  <L4nce0> I need to make it so exicution is not 4 hours.. it's navigating to 5*2 base webpages, and then going to 400*3 webpages, and starting a dowload of a small file.
2011-06-21T06:33:19  <ato> Parallellize?
2011-06-21T06:33:24  <davehunt> freynaud: So Selenium 2.0 running with -role rc should send heartbeats? I'm not seeing that
2011-06-21T06:33:50  <L4nce0> ..not really sure how that helps with bandwidth
2011-06-21T06:33:54  <jimevans> Ivog: is this the Java bindings, or another language?
2011-06-21T06:34:08  <Ivog> C#
2011-06-21T06:34:33  <jimevans> I'm pretty sure I was on the latest when I built and released the .NET bindings.
2011-06-21T06:34:37  <Ivog> Doesnt work with latest version also
2011-06-21T06:34:46  <jimevans> then it doesn't matter.
2011-06-21T06:34:47  <freynaud> davehunt:  reading the code
2011-06-21T06:35:01  <L4nce0> I've disabled all the image downloading, but I'm not really sure what else I can do to speed it up
2011-06-21T06:35:15  <freynaud> davehunt: i may have been a bit optimistic
2011-06-21T06:35:23  <__mike> L4nce0 stick it on a grid
2011-06-21T06:35:27  <jimevans> Ivog: do you know if you have the same problem in Java (or ruby or python)? I need to know if the problem is language-specific, or if it's in the code common to all languages.
2011-06-21T06:35:31  <__mike> and then parallelise the tests with a thread pool
2011-06-21T06:35:35  <freynaud> the hub understands heartbeat, but the new nodes don't send them
2011-06-21T06:35:45  <davehunt> freynaud: I saw that Grid 2.0 supports the heartbeat request, but couldn't see where it sends them
2011-06-21T06:35:48  <L4nce0> __mike, a grid? yes I am connected to the cities power grid ;)
2011-06-21T06:35:58  <__mike> lol
2011-06-21T06:36:17  <__mike> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2
2011-06-21T06:36:19  <L4nce0> it's not actually a test, it's a web scrapper that makes an excel file with 30k entries..
2011-06-21T06:36:23  <Ivog> Im not sure
2011-06-21T06:36:29  <davehunt> freynaud: could we add that in? at the moment if we restart the hub then we also have to restart all nodes :/
2011-06-21T06:36:38  <__mike> docs are there L4nce0
2011-06-21T06:36:50  <__mike> which reminds me i want to write some tonight..
2011-06-21T06:37:06  <L4nce0> cool I'll check it out.
2011-06-21T06:37:07  <freynaud> davehunt: sure. I don't see that problem as the hub is registering the node for me:)
2011-06-21T06:37:21  <Ivog> One minute jim let me find out
2011-06-21T06:37:53  <__mike> L4nce0: grid allows you to run nodes on many different machines and have the tests executing there. if you only have one machine there isn't that much point in using a grid. you would be better off just parallelising your tests with a thread pool or something
2011-06-21T06:37:58  <Ivog> Ok so the java tests work, c# dont work
2011-06-21T06:37:58  <davehunt> freynaud: the hub registers the node?
2011-06-21T06:38:33  <jimevans> ok. that's a problem in C# then. give me a minute to update this environment to latest sources.
2011-06-21T06:39:05  <jimevans> is there a specific test case that shows the problem?
2011-06-21T06:39:05  <freynaud> davehunt:  yes. My node usually do not exist yet when i start the hub. The hub starts, and using a beforeReistration hook, it powers on the VM, start webdriver and all the stuff I'm too lazy to do myslft
2011-06-21T06:39:48  <Ivog> There's 7 dotnet tests failing on my machine concerning elementselecting
2011-06-21T06:40:15  <Ivog> And 3 draganddrop tests

2011-06-21T06:40:40  <rpk> morning
2011-06-21T06:41:28  <__mike> L4nce0 you would probably get the biggest speedup from parallelising if you're not doing so already
2011-06-21T06:43:00  <L4nce0> I still don't see how that would help. I make a list of links I need to visit and click the download button on. In the end I/O is the problem, not my CPU
2011-06-21T06:44:02  <L4nce0> (not intending to sound rude, its 8 am and haven't gone to bed yet =) )
2011-06-21T06:44:09  <__mike> say you split the list into 2. you could have 2 different browsers working on each half of the list at the same time. does that sound like something that would make it faster ?
2011-06-21T06:44:52  <L4nce0> well, isn't that like taking a bottleneck, and cutting the hole in two?
2011-06-21T06:45:15  <rpk> no, you can execute multiple requests at a time on your webserver
2011-06-21T06:45:37  <__mike> the 2 different webdrivers can be executed concurrently
2011-06-21T06:45:40  <__mike> and perform independently
2011-06-21T06:45:40  <L4nce0> ah I see, interesting..

2011-06-21T06:46:23  <L4nce0> I didn't think that THEIR servers responce time might be the real bottleneck. I mean a 12 mb connection and tiny excel files..
2011-06-21T06:46:29  <__mike> firefox is definitely okay. not sure about chrome. i think that's okay too
2011-06-21T06:46:50  <__mike> you mean the bottleneck is your download speed ?
2011-06-21T06:46:58  <rpk> you need to  confirm that the correct file is being sent?
2011-06-21T06:46:59  <L4nce0> I'm using custom profiles, is that going to be an issue? I have to because the way this site handles logons
2011-06-21T06:47:05  <rpk> why not just look at the request?
2011-06-21T06:47:12  <rpk> (response to the request)
2011-06-21T06:47:20  <rpk> and no, just load identical custom profiles
2011-06-21T06:47:30  <L4nce0> they are all called the same, firefox just downloads it and appends a number
2011-06-21T06:48:06  <rpk> is there another way you can validate the download, without actually downloading?
2011-06-21T06:48:07  <Ivog> Just use 1 profile for all ff instances
2011-06-21T06:48:17  <rpk> perhaps checking what url the download request is sent to?
2011-06-21T06:48:19  <L4nce0> I will try this, thank you for the help. After I sleep I will return and ask why I am getting random empty firefox windows lo

2011-06-21T07:37:57  <Ivog> That xp machine is x86 i assume can a windows7 64 machine be added as well?
2011-06-21T07:38:23  <jimevans> the biggest problem would be making sure you're building in a VS environment from the command line. The "go" build script works a treat for .NET, including tests.

2011-06-21T07:40:23  <Ivog> Can xserve handle 64bit?
2011-06-21T07:40:38  <adamgoucher> the machine right now is pretty maxed out
2011-06-21T07:41:14  <adamgoucher> we have on out (long) list of to-do's to fix the build environment(s)
2011-06-21T07:42:05  <Ivog> Ok, because win764 is an env giving problems, not sure if xp x86 has those same problems
2011-06-21T07:42:20  <jimevans> Ivog: In all of the issues I've encountered while working on the project, I've yet to run into a 32-bit vs. 64-bit Windows issue. I've seen problems among different version of browsers, but not 32- vs. 64-bit
2011-06-21T07:43:02  <jimevans> the problems you're currently seeing in the .NET firefox tests are test-related, not bugs in the project code.

I'm using a basic test ( http://pastebin.com/aVUKM1Gv ).  using browser '*iexplore' results in a script error in htmlutils.js, so on the recommendation of http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1517623/internet-explorer-8-64bit-and-selenium-not-working I switched to iexploreproxy.  now it goes to www.example.com...
2011-06-21T10:35:34  <__phil__> ...and then just hangs. Command history: http://pastebin.com/Fcy9kggy  Debug log: http://pastebin.com/mh991Vph
2011-06-21T10:35:35  <hiredgun79> ok, so the RC is just pinging connection to hub… and not getting any sort of error message, but wondering if it somehow loses connection and that's why it's not continuing with the tests

2011-06-21T10:51:07  <jarib> dhackner: you're probably confusing CSS and Sizzle
2011-06-21T10:51:15  <dhackner> how can I work around queries like "div#foo a:contains('bar')"
2011-06-21T10:51:25  <dhackner> jarib: perhaps. can you elaborate?
2011-06-21T10:51:37  <jarib> contains() isn't part of the CSS spec
2011-06-21T10:51:43  <dhackner> css3
2011-06-21T10:51:45  <jarib> no
2011-06-21T10:51:48  <dhackner> no?
2011-06-21T10:51:51  <jarib> no.
2011-06-21T10:51:53  <AutomatedTester> dhackner: it was dropped from CSS3
2011-06-21T10:51:58  <dhackner> hmmm
2011-06-21T10:52:27  <dhackner> is sizzle like css or jquery where its another js selector library?
2011-06-21T10:52:28  <jarib> it works in SE1 since it's using Sizzle to provide CSS support
2011-06-21T10:52:49  <AutomatedTester> dhackner: Sizzle is CSS plus extras
2011-06-21T10:52:50  <jarib> Sizzle provides contains() as an extension
2011-06-21T10:52:53  <dhackner> gotcha
2011-06-21T10:52:55  <dhackner> hmm
2011-06-21T10:52:58  <dhackner> so
2011-06-21T10:53:07  <dhackner> i had sizzle and jquery (which I added as an extension)
2011-06-21T10:53:13  <jarib> webdriver will use the browser's native CSS implementation
2011-06-21T10:53:23  <dhackner> how can I write what I wrote above in webdriver code for java?
2011-06-21T10:53:29  <dhackner> "div#foo a:contains('bar')"
2011-06-21T10:53:49  <jarib> easiest is to use an xpath
2011-06-21T10:54:08  <dhackner> i was under the impression we were moving away from xpath when possible?
2011-06-21T10:54:13  <dhackner> at least w/SE1
2011-06-21T10:55:00  <jarib> there are tradeoffs
2011-06-21T10:55:10  <dhackner> speed
2011-06-21T10:55:10  <jarib> XPath is slow in IE which doesn't have a native XPath implementation
2011-06-21T10:55:33  <dhackner> so what is the ideal way to do that locator for IE? still xpath?
2011-06-21T10:56:21  <jarib> either that or iterate through the anchors in java
2011-06-21T10:57:08  <dhackner> hmm
2011-06-21T10:57:30  <dhackner> guess I'll need to write some webdriver extensions to do that
2011-06-21T10:57:49  <dhackner> since java won't let me write a clean little .foreach() kinda thing like groovy or ruby
