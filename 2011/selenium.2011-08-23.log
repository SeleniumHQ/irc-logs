2011-08-23T03:41:51  <Fry33> or it will stay in code for ever
2011-08-23T03:42:02  <AutomatedTester> Fry33: WebDriverBackedSelenium?
2011-08-23T03:42:09  <Fry33> yes
2011-08-23T03:42:18  <AutomatedTester> it will be deprecated
2011-08-23T03:42:25  <AutomatedTester> its a stop gap
2011-08-23T03:42:42  <AutomatedTester> there will be plenty of warning
2011-08-23T03:44:01  <Fry33> so, in future version of selenium WebDriverBackedSelenium can be removed at all? right?

2011-08-23T03:46:16  <AutomatedTester> Ajay_: cost
2011-08-23T03:46:21  <eranm> Fry33, it will probably migrate to a deprecated package / project sometime in the future
2011-08-23T03:47:12  <Fry33> ok, I hope it is not near future:)
2011-08-23T03:47:14  <Ajay_> Somebody should come up with a transformer which transforms rc to webdriver

2011-08-23T04:08:22  <eranm> Could be

2011-08-23T04:09:37  <Ajay_> yeah sure
2011-08-23T04:11:40  <jarib> basically the solution is to have these load timeouts happen on the webdriver side (which we've discussd), instead of the HTTP client timing out and then expecting webdriver to act like a fresh driver on the next command

2011-08-23T05:40:40  <jimevans> passed even.
2011-08-23T05:40:53  <jimevans> IE9 that is.

2011-08-23T05:41:24  <jimevans> was it giving an ElementNotVisibleException?
2011-08-23T05:41:52  <AutomatedTester> not sure
2011-08-23T05:41:57  <jimevans> i've seen that with IE8, but not 9.
2011-08-23T05:41:59  <AutomatedTester> let me try run it on my machines
2011-08-23T05:42:35  <jimevans> that test tries to click on the <body> element after uploading to fire the onchange event, and for some reason, IE8 considers the <body> element invisible.

2011-08-23T05:57:13  <AutomatedTester> ok, I have opened IE and resized it and closed it
2011-08-23T05:57:17  <AutomatedTester> running tests again
2011-08-23T05:57:27  <jimevans> if the center of the element isn't in the viewport after attempting to scroll to make it so, we report that the element isn't visible.
2011-08-23T05:57:53  <jimevans> normally, this is correct, but for the <body> element as used by that test may be completely wrong.
2011-08-23T05:58:48  <AutomatedTester> eranm: how we going with the 3.5 and 3.0 issues?

2011-08-23T06:03:28  <jimevans> the way to solve it would be to have the java test click on an element other than body.
2011-08-23T06:04:03  <jimevans> for example, driver.findElement(By.id("id-name1")).click();
2011-08-23T06:04:43  <jimevans> (which is a text box, so clicking on it shouldn't have any ill effects)

2011-08-23T06:06:21  <jimevans> check that your mouse pointer isn't physically over the browser window.
2011-08-23T06:06:41  <jimevans> that's a constant problem with IE, and there's nothing Selenium can do to fix it, that I know of.
2011-08-23T06:06:46  <djonsson> AutomatedTester: any nice workarounds?
2011-08-23T06:07:25  * jimevans hates IE's mouse pointer hit test polling
2011-08-23T06:07:26  <Fry33> Does  WebDriverBackedSelenium required nodes with WD role? or it can be run on nodes with RC?
2011-08-23T06:08:39  <jimevans> though i'd love for eranm or someone else to prove me wrong.

2011-08-23T06:10:02  <eranm> jimevans, it is a constant problem - You could add a bit of code that uses java.awt.Robot (if you're in Java) to move the mouse somewhere at the beginning of the test suite
2011-08-23T06:10:10  <eranm> Would be rather annoying if you're testing on your desktop
2011-08-23T06:10:52  <eranm> But working on Selenium, you quickly learn you don't want to do that anyway

2011-08-23T06:11:56  <jimevans> we could also add a way to toggle native and simulated events at runtime (rather than just at driver-creation time)
2011-08-23T06:12:36  <jimevans> though that may suffer from the same problem.
2011-08-23T06:17:05  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: everything passed
2011-08-23T06:17:48  <AutomatedTester> ok, once Firefox stuff is sorted we release
2011-08-23T06:18:05  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: jarib eranm : happy with that?
2011-08-23T06:18:39  <lord1234> jarib: can i shoot you a pm pls?
2011-08-23T06:18:43  <jarib> AutomatedTester: yep - have anyone looked at click_test.html?
2011-08-23T06:18:45  <jarib> lord1234: sure
2011-08-23T06:18:55  <AutomatedTester> jarib: not sure
2011-08-23T06:19:04  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I'd like to submit support for double click for Firefox / Linux, but it can wait until after the release
2011-08-23T06:19:12  <AutomatedTester> eranm: is that part of the issue you are looking at?
2011-08-23T06:19:14  <eranm> jimevans, I would definitely not want to see such a toggle.
2011-08-23T06:19:20  <eranm> AutomatedTester, nope.
2011-08-23T06:19:42  <eranm> What is the issue # for the click_test ?
2011-08-23T06:19:48  <jarib> none
2011-08-23T06:19:54  <jarib> it's failing on Firefox 6
2011-08-23T06:20:36  <jarib> i can create one?
2011-08-23T06:21:02  <eranm> jimevans, the distinction between native and simulated events is already fine and confusing for some users. Where we support better user emulation with user events, it should be on by default - synthesized events should only be used on browsers where we can't support native events.
2011-08-23T06:21:08  <eranm> jarib, go ahead.
2011-08-23T06:21:15  <jarib> it looks simple (something with the Math.random fragment being added to the URLs), but i couldn't figure it out

2011-08-23T06:22:11  <jarib> test_javascript?
2011-08-23T06:22:40  <eranm> jarib, nope, test_firefox. I'll try test_javascript

2011-08-23T06:50:54  <jarib> Guest50738: usually state changes also means a change in the UI, so you wait for the UI to be in the correct state

2011-08-23T07:09:19  <eranm> jimevans, what's the weirdness?
2011-08-23T07:09:53  <jimevans> it looks like the drag is not starting at the correct location, resulting in an element highight instead of drag-drop
2011-08-23T07:10:29  <jimevans> I was seeing it in .net, but now i'm seeing it with java with FF6
2011-08-23T07:10:44  <eranm> AutomatedTester, I'm fairly confident the Javascript tests are ok, but I can run the tests in a couple of minutes to check.
2011-08-23T07:10:57  <eranm> jimevans, does it make a specific test fail?
2011-08-23T07:11:16  <jimevans> i get a failure running 'go test_firefox method=testDragAndDrop'
2011-08-23T07:11:57  <jimevans> i don't normally run the entire firefox suite on windows, since the "start 10 instances of firefox and manipulate them all" often falls over on windows.
2011-08-23T07:12:15  <eranm> Really? It passed for me just the other day.
2011-08-23T07:12:24  <jimevans> i know. it's really strange.
2011-08-23T07:12:48  <andreashaas> jimevans: you can use the argument testonerror=false and testonfailure=false
2011-08-23T07:12:52  <eranm> jimevans, if you can reproduce it, send the error console from Firefox
2011-08-23T07:13:09  <jimevans> roger that. give me a second.
2011-08-23T07:13:13  <andreashaas> the test suite then does not stop at errors and failures
2011-08-23T07:13:31  <eranm> jimevans, profile.setPreference("webdriver.log.file", "firefox_console"); -> will save the console to a file.
2011-08-23T07:13:48  <jimevans> andreashaas: yes, i'm aware of that switch.
2011-08-23T07:13:58  <jimevans> er, those switches.
2011-08-23T07:14:14  <andreashaas> they are nice, aren't they

2011-08-23T07:48:04  <Elvanor> jarib: I've redownloaded the jar, and it's not there
2011-08-23T07:48:11  <Elvanor> even in 2.4
2011-08-23T07:48:13  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: yt
2011-08-23T07:48:28  <adamgoucher> depends if i need to think or not
2011-08-23T07:48:34  <jarib> Elvanor: it is
2011-08-23T07:48:51  <jarib> $ jar tf selenium-java-2.4.0.zip | grep opera
2011-08-23T07:48:51  <jarib> selenium-2.4.0/libs/operadriver-v0.6.jar
2011-08-23T07:48:53  <AutomatedTester> did you try make tests for the marks stuff?
2011-08-23T07:49:01  <Elvanor> jarib: ha, in libs...
2011-08-23T07:49:02  <Elvanor> OK
2011-08-23T07:49:05  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: ^
2011-08-23T07:49:06  <Elvanor> thx
2011-08-23T07:50:21  <eranm> jimevans, the browser-specific offset applies to Firefox 4 and up - since the toolbars are now a part of the window, their presence should be compensated
2011-08-23T07:50:24  <adamgoucher> i dont see what i am looking at
2011-08-23T07:50:42  <AutomatedTester> did you make tests for the pytest mark code you did?
2011-08-23T07:50:43  <lord1234> AutomatedTester: I would disagree
2011-08-23T07:50:54  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: irt?
2011-08-23T07:50:56  <lord1234> I had to lower the amount of info I was giving jarib, cuz it was overkill and made the info confusing.
2011-08-23T07:51:10  <Parabola> jarib: ive got a stack trace but theres no useful information in here
2011-08-23T07:51:10  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: thats a good problem to have
2011-08-23T07:51:24  <AutomatedTester> unfortunately thats not where people start when raise bugs
2011-08-23T07:51:27  <jimevans> eranm: that's understandable.
2011-08-23T07:51:32  <lord1234> oh its not where I started either:-p
2011-08-23T07:51:34  <eranm> AutomatedTester, the javascript tests are failing on Firefox 5 or me
2011-08-23T07:51:39  <eranm> jimevans, so what isn't? :)
2011-08-23T07:51:42  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: unsure. i may have done them by hand
2011-08-23T07:51:48  <adamgoucher> (check my github)
2011-08-23T07:52:06  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: no tests there, was hoping you may have forgot to commit
2011-08-23T07:52:07  <Parabola> however I think i found why its breaking
2011-08-23T07:52:12  <Parabola> i just don't know why :)
2011-08-23T07:52:15  <lord1234> so if someone REALLY wants to use php webdriver, is there any support by seleniumHQ or no?
2011-08-23T07:52:33  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: we support the JSON Wire Protocol
2011-08-23T07:52:41  <Parabola> on the class thats executing the actual test I see under Variables: "This> driver = null "
2011-08-23T07:52:41  <AutomatedTester> not the language bindings
2011-08-23T07:52:42  <jimevans> eranm: something's off with the position of the start of the drag. it's almost like it's starting above the upper-left corner of the element instead of at the center.
2011-08-23T07:52:48  <Parabola> so driver.get isnt working
2011-08-23T07:52:58  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: i rmember writing out a big chart of what to include/disclude. likely just ran a script and checked what was filtered
2011-08-23T07:53:04  <Elvanor> jarib: ok, nice it runs, tests do not pass yet though
2011-08-23T07:53:13  <Elvanor> I have  a com.opera.core.systems.scope.exceptions.ResponseNotReceivedException: No response in a timely fashion.
2011-08-23T07:53:22  <Elvanor> when doing the initial get() with the driver.
2011-08-23T07:53:27  <AutomatedTester> ok, will do that then
2011-08-23T07:53:31  <eranm> jimevans, notice we use the accessibility API to get the location of the element and prefer it
2011-08-23T07:53:38  <AutomatedTester> and make them python tests
2011-08-23T07:53:40  <jarib> lord1234: i'd say you had to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, not lower the amount of info per se :)
2011-08-23T07:53:51  <lord1234> jarib ok:)

2011-08-23T07:55:58  <adamgoucher> can add multiple marks in a single decorator
2011-08-23T07:56:04  <jarib> Stuk: Elvanor is getting a "no response in a timely fashion" error on driver.get()
2011-08-23T07:56:08  <Stuk> Elvanor: how are you starting OperaDriver/what script are you using?

2011-08-23T08:14:37  <Parabola> hey jimevans i got it working :)
2011-08-23T08:14:45  <Parabola> however its very very slow, FF5 on linux

2011-08-23T08:15:04  <jimevans> Parabola: well glad you at least got it working.
2011-08-23T08:15:05  <Parabola> like from the time it loaded the page, until it found a login button (finding by ID) it was at least 15 seconds
2011-08-23T08:15:15  <Guest5015> I'm trying to run grid when I run some code into the hub I get
2011-08-23T08:15:16  <Parabola> it used to take about 10 seconds for this whole test
2011-08-23T08:15:19  <Guest5015> File "/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/selenium-2.4.0-py2.6.egg/selenium/selenium.py", line 189, in start
2011-08-23T08:15:25  <Parabola> now its about a minute
2011-08-23T08:15:56  <Guest5015> it looks like it cannot start a browser or something
2011-08-23T08:16:00  <Parabola> driver.findElement(By.id("logonId")).clear(); <-- that shouldnt take 15 seconds to locate it right?
2011-08-23T08:16:22  <jimevans> i wouldn't think so
2011-08-23T08:16:27  <Parabola> it didnt used to :-\
2011-08-23T08:16:31  <Parabola> hm
2011-08-23T08:17:18  <Guest5015> can I ask a question now?
2011-08-23T08:17:20  <jimevans> jarib: alerts in chrome work with what version of chrome?
2011-08-23T08:17:22  <jimevans> :ask

2011-08-23T08:17:25  <eranm> AutomatedTester, what's with the Gecko SDKs disappearing from Mozilla's site? is this a scheme to prevent developers from compiling extension to any version on Firefox other than 6?
2011-08-23T08:17:41  <AutomatedTester> eranm: probably
2011-08-23T08:17:59  <AutomatedTester> eranm: the security update for Firefox 5 is Firefox 6
2011-08-23T08:18:17  <AutomatedTester> paraphrasing something I read not long ago
2011-08-23T08:18:22  <Elvanor> Stuk: ok, I updated to 2.4 but same problem
2011-08-23T08:18:31  <jimevans> eranm: looks like we're back to checking gecko into our tree. :)
2011-08-23T08:18:48  <eranm> It's all fine and well, but that means we're forced to drop support for Firefox 4 and 5
2011-08-23T08:18:52  <jarib> jimevans: not sure, but the latest of everything seems to work ok :)
2011-08-23T08:19:04  <jimevans> latest on which channel, though?
2011-08-23T08:19:07  <Stuk> Elvanor: :( so The script starts, Opera starts, it navigates to the page, then on the next method you get the exception?
2011-08-23T08:19:13  <Elvanor> no
2011-08-23T08:19:18  <Elvanor> I get the exception on the
2011-08-23T08:19:25  <Elvanor> driver.get("file://${FunctionalTestSuite.testDirectory}selenium.html?kameleoon=true")
2011-08-23T08:19:28  <Elvanor> line
2011-08-23T08:19:45  <jarib> jimevans: i'm on the dev channel everywhere i think.. are you asking because i removed spec guards?
2011-08-23T08:19:46  <Elvanor> This page loads a heavy script, taking about 10 secs to load, could that be the problem?
2011-08-23T08:19:58  <AutomatedTester> eranm: tbh, it might be worth it since we only support 3.6, and 6 atm
2011-08-23T08:20:05  <Nogem> ide plugin updated for Firefox 6 already?
2011-08-23T08:20:16  <Stuk> hmm, that probably has something to do with it, how quickly to you get the exception?
2011-08-23T08:20:18  <jimevans> jarib: partially. i was thinking of doing the same for .NET, but I have the stable channel installed.
2011-08-23T08:20:29  <Parabola> okay jimevans its exactly 24 seconds for it to locate it
2011-08-23T08:21:00  <jimevans> Parabola: this is (1) firefox, (2) linux, (3) and java, right?
2011-08-23T08:21:01  <jarib> jimevans: and it's failing? i have to admit i may have been using an unreleased chromedriver build..
2011-08-23T08:21:08  <Parabola> oops i pasted wrong bit. this is what took 24 seconds "		if(isElementPresent(driver, By.id("logonId"))) {"
2011-08-23T08:21:10  <Elvanor> Stuk: also I use several times the get() methods on the script, but I only see the page loading once
2011-08-23T08:21:21  <Elvanor> where as in Chrome and FF it "reloads" several times
2011-08-23T08:21:32  <Parabola> the entering of data and submission into the fields once login is clicked is quick
2011-08-23T08:21:37  <jarib> jimevans: (from http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/)
2011-08-23T08:21:42  <Parabola> jimevans: correct, FF5, Linux, Java
2011-08-23T08:21:57  <Stuk> okay, it should load the page several times
2011-08-23T08:22:04  <jimevans> jarib: yes, not recognizing alerts or confirms.

2011-08-23T08:23:22  <Stuk> Elvanor: also, our page loading timeout is 30 seconds, does it take longer than that for the page to finish loading?
2011-08-23T08:23:28  <Elvanor> no

2011-08-23T08:23:46  <Elvanor> and besides, the page has already loaded (eg, domReady is fired), it is just the script execution that takes a long time
2011-08-23T08:23:47  <Stuk> Elvanor: the html page and the things it loads would be really useful
2011-08-23T08:23:54  <Stuk> ahhh
2011-08-23T08:24:01  <Elvanor> Stuk: I can probably reproduce that on a public server wait

2011-08-23T08:24:21  <jimevans> jarib: it looks like the latest released chromedriver.exe at least knows about alerts, but the stable channel of chrome doesn't (i'm guessing)

2011-08-23T08:31:44  <jimevans> yes, but I'd rephrase it slightly. something like "I'm getting a CapabilityNotPresentOnTheGridException when trying to use it with *firefox using Selenium RC. What could cause that?"

2011-08-23T08:33:11  <Parabola> firefox 6 isnt working :-\

2011-08-23T08:34:41  <jimevans> i disagree with respect to IDE, but that's not relevant

2011-08-23T09:03:17  <Guest5015> it is the hub

2011-08-23T09:04:34  <Guest5015> it is the server
2011-08-23T09:06:20  <cgoldberg> Guest5015, what does "-role webdriver" do.  you aren't using webdriver
2011-08-23T09:07:53  <jarib> AutomatedTester, eranm: about click_test.html, it seems like in Firefox 6, window.location.hash isn't updated immediately after our bot.action.click call. adding an alert between the click and the assertion makes the test pass
2011-08-23T09:08:15  <jarib> so presumably the updating of window.location was made more async in FF6..
2011-08-23T09:08:45  <lord1234> jimevans: is there a reason php was eprecated?
2011-08-23T09:08:48  <lord1234> it seems quite a bit of the web si in LAMP stacks...
2011-08-23T09:09:16  <Guest5015> cgoldberg: hmm.. so how to use webdriver in that case in python?
2011-08-23T09:09:32  * Guest5015 missed something
2011-08-23T09:09:46  <cgoldberg> Guest5015, look at your imports
2011-08-23T09:10:06  <jarib> AutomatedTester, eranm: i guess we could rewrite it to be an async test case, but it's passing in older firefoxes and chrome..
2011-08-23T09:10:07  <cgoldberg> 'from selenium import selenium'
2011-08-23T09:10:13  * Guest5015 wants to connect to different computer
2011-08-23T09:10:31  <Guest5015> from selenium import webdriver?
2011-08-23T09:11:07  <cgoldberg> Guest5015, yes... but then you are using the webdriver API.  so you will have to adjust your code to use that API
2011-08-23T09:11:17  <cgoldberg> it is similar, but slightly different than selenium API
2011-08-23T09:11:42  <Guest5015> hm... it looks like I do not know how to do remote with webdriver
2011-08-23T09:11:56  <jimevans> lord1234: i'm guessing because nobody stepped up to create/maintain bindings for php, then get them stable enough to be considered a candidate for the main project.
2011-08-23T09:12:21  <jimevans> lord1234: same logic applies for perl.
2011-08-23T09:12:26  <lord1234> i see

2011-08-23T09:47:40  <Elvanor> I noticed Firefox and ChromeDriver handles things totally differently
2011-08-23T09:48:01  <Elvanor> In Chrome, if you click on an Element, it will actually click over the coordinates of that element.
2011-08-23T09:48:16  <Elvanor> so if there is an element that is over the element you specify, this element will get the click
2011-08-23T09:48:26  <Elvanor> whereas in FF not so: the element underneath will get the click
2011-08-23T09:48:40  <Elvanor> This difference of behavior is really problematic. Is it considered a bug?

2011-08-23T09:50:18  <Elvanor> but it just that behavior should be consistent between drivers
2011-08-23T09:50:32  <Elvanor> either you choose to simulate a click at x, y (like chrome does)

2011-08-23T09:51:24  <Elvanor> (it seems to me they are, on Chrome they are)
2011-08-23T09:51:39  <jimevans> in firefox on linux, it's possible to click on elements using native OS events, but you have to specify that.
2011-08-23T09:52:01  <jimevans> sorry, i was speaking of firefox, and didn't clearly say so.
2011-08-23T09:53:11  <Elvanor> jimevans: can you tell me how to enable those events?
2011-08-23T09:53:16  <Elvanor> so that the behavior is the same
2011-08-23T09:53:46  <Ajay__> :seen dawagner
2011-08-23T09:53:46  <selbot2_> dawagner was last seen about 18 hours ago, quitting.
2011-08-23T09:56:02  <jimevans> Elvanor: that's going to be slightly different depending on the language binding you're using, but the idea is you call profile.setEnableNativeEvents(true) where profile is a FirefoxProfile object.
2011-08-23T09:56:17  <jimevans> this profile object is passed into the constructor for the FirefoxDriver object.
2011-08-23T09:56:38  <Elvanor> jimevans: I use Java
2011-08-23T09:56:49  <Elvanor> let me see if I can do that
2011-08-23T09:56:58  <jimevans> then that syntax is correct for Java.
2011-08-23T09:57:15  <eranm> jarib, I'll look into this issue.
2011-08-23T09:57:31  <jimevans> Elvanor: note: i'm not a java developer, so i don't regularly use the java language bindings. I may be wrong about this.
2011-08-23T09:57:47  <eranm> Elvanor, what jimevans said.
2011-08-23T09:57:54  <Elvanor> yeah
2011-08-23T09:58:00  <Elvanor> I actually use Groovy :)
2011-08-23T09:58:17  <lord1234> there are no groovy webbindings for webdriver AFAIk
2011-08-23T09:58:37  <eranm> The fact that  we can't click the coordinates is a pain - you want to know if you think you're clicking one element but actually clicking another, because that's what will happen to your users as well
2011-08-23T09:59:15  <Elvanor> lord1234: the ones from Java work very well
2011-08-23T09:59:21  <Elvanor> groovy runs on the JVM
2011-08-23T09:59:21  <lord1234> i see
2011-08-23T09:59:34  <Elvanor> eranm: that has been my biggest problem so far
2011-08-23T09:59:47  <Elvanor> chrome and firefox click different elements :)
2011-08-23T10:00:00  <lord1234> who is lukasz or maciej  who do the php webbindings?
2011-08-23T10:00:03  <lord1234> anyone know?
2011-08-23T10:00:08  <Elvanor> jimevans: no, enabling native events had no effects
2011-08-23T10:00:19  <Elvanor> it still clicks the underneath (target) event, it seems
2011-08-23T10:00:23  <Elvanor> s/event/element
2011-08-23T10:00:30  <eranm> Elvanor, which FF version and Selenium versions do you use?
2011-08-23T10:00:35  <Elvanor> 5.0 / 2.4
2011-08-23T10:00:53  <Elvanor> 				FirefoxProfile profile = new FirefoxProfile()
2011-08-23T10:00:53  <Elvanor> 				profile.setEnableNativeEvents(true)
2011-08-23T10:00:53  <Elvanor> 				driver = new FirefoxDriver(profile)

2011-08-23T10:03:28  <jimevans> ner0x: what language?
2011-08-23T10:03:44  <ner0x> jimevans: perl, but I should be able to figure it out no matter which you give me.
2011-08-23T10:03:49  <eranm> ner0x, have a look at the Select class in the support.ui package
2011-08-23T10:04:02  <eranm> (in the Java bindings)
2011-08-23T10:04:07  <jimevans> ner0x: .click on the <option> element.
2011-08-23T10:04:39  <jimevans> the Select (SelectElement in .NET) class provides a convenient wrapper for <select> elements, but i don't know if there's a perl binding equivalent.
2011-08-23T10:06:10  <Elvanor> eranm: ha wait, it seems the test has failed because of a side effect of activating the nativeevents :)

2011-08-23T10:34:38  <Elvanor> jimevans: so with native events, Firefox wrongly computes the coordinates of an element :(
2011-08-23T10:34:43  <lord1234> and your error si line 17?
2011-08-23T10:34:49  <Elvanor> unless it takes as base starting point the lower left corner
2011-08-23T10:34:59  <Elvanor> (instead of the upper left corner, which I would expect)
2011-08-23T10:35:26  <cgoldberg> Guest5015, try with   browser = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_capabilities, command_executor='http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub'), browser_profile=None)
2011-08-23T10:35:53  <jimevans> Elvanor: now that's interesting news.
2011-08-23T10:35:57  <Elvanor> I got Location provided by Accessibility API = (x,y)
2011-08-23T10:36:00  <Elvanor> and y is wrong
2011-08-23T10:36:17  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: ^^ that may be why my drag-drop is failing on windows, because of native events and the coordinates being wrong.

2011-08-23T10:37:25  <jimevans> Elvanor: i've been a little distracted with about 6 other Selenium issues, so haven't had time to dig into this one except to note that "it doesn't work"
2011-08-23T10:37:37  <Elvanor> okay
2011-08-23T10:37:50  <Elvanor> these position problems have been poisoning me since the very start
2011-08-23T10:37:56  <jimevans> it's a shame eranm just left.
2011-08-23T10:38:04  <Elvanor> for instance if you use click() on an element, Chrome clicks center of an element
2011-08-23T10:38:10  <Elvanor> whereas Firefox clicks top left
2011-08-23T10:38:21  <Elvanor> or bottom left, with native events
2011-08-23T10:38:43  <Elvanor> The behavior is very different from browser to browser, so this should all be sanitized somehow
2011-08-23T10:38:50  <Guest5015> lord1234: cgoldberg: invalid syntax
2011-08-23T10:39:02  <cgoldberg> what's invalid?
2011-08-23T10:39:04  <Elvanor> because this is causing all sorts of problems
2011-08-23T10:39:14  <Elvanor> I should maybe log all my discoveries somewhere
2011-08-23T10:39:28  <jimevans> Elvanor: it's not supposed to be different from browser to browser; it's supposed to be the same.

2011-08-23T10:46:19  <Elvanor> for instance
2011-08-23T10:46:29  <Elvanor> if you use moveToElement(element, 5, 5)
2011-08-23T10:46:35  <Elvanor> then it moves from the top left
2011-08-23T10:46:39  <Elvanor> at +5, +5
2011-08-23T10:46:41  <Elvanor> but if you do
2011-08-23T10:46:41  <Guest5015> cgoldberg: where is your knowledge from?
2011-08-23T10:46:46  <Elvanor> moveToElement(element, 0, 0)
2011-08-23T10:46:54  <Elvanor> it moves from the center of the element!!

2011-08-23T10:58:26  <wanderso> So you can do selenium.fireEvent("xpath","blur")

2011-08-23T13:28:04  <jimevans> okay
2011-08-23T13:28:08  <Parabola> theres a 20 second delay when it gets to one of the if statements :-\
2011-08-23T13:28:12  <Parabola> any ideas?

2011-08-23T13:28:55  <jimevans> have you set the implicitWait timeout anywhere? [driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait()]

2011-08-23T13:29:05  <Parabola> each driver has one, 30 seconds

2011-08-23T13:30:53  <AutomatedTester> hey berrada
2011-08-23T13:31:01  <jimevans> Parabola: it probably won't change anything. however, if you've set the implicit wait timeout, and the element doesn't exist, it shouldn't return until the timeout passes.
2011-08-23T13:31:09  <AutomatedTester> any chance you can release an updated APK today?
2011-08-23T13:31:12  <Parabola> the elements are there
2011-08-23T13:31:17  <Parabola> no errors, its just really slow
2011-08-23T13:31:21  <berrada> yes, releasing a new apk now
2011-08-23T13:31:24  <Parabola> first if() and its a 24 second wait
2011-08-23T13:31:32  <Parabola> then each findElement within the if is quick
2011-08-23T13:31:39  <AutomatedTester> berrada: awesome!
2011-08-23T13:31:40  <Parabola> then once it hits the next if, its slow again

2011-08-23T13:34:33  <jimevans> Parabola: i'd guess that the element you think is there, really isn't (or more correctly, webdriver doesn't think it is), so you're hitting the timeout

2011-08-23T13:40:32  <jimevans> Parabola: i believe you. i'm just saying that it sounds suspiciously like you're attempting to do a findElement for an element webdriver can't find with the implicit wait timeout set.
2011-08-23T13:41:34  <jimevans> if the element isn't there (in webdriver's view) webdriver will keep trying to find it right up until the timeout.
2011-08-23T13:42:08  <jimevans> it's even more suspicious that removing the implicit wait timeout removes the delay.

2011-08-23T14:18:33  <kennethkoontz> dawagner, I use vimdiff, but thats because I like VIM:)
2011-08-23T14:19:06  <dawagner> kennethkoontz: How do you use vimdiff for multi-file changes?
2011-08-23T14:20:22  <kennethkoontz> For example when resolving merges, it will allow you to see the diff between all 3 copies.
2011-08-23T14:20:48  <dawagner> Yeah, but I have a 500-file change, and I want to skim the diff of all 500 files
2011-08-23T14:20:56  <kennethkoontz> ack
2011-08-23T14:21:16  <kennethkoontz> Thought it was something more simple than that:)
2011-08-23T14:21:20  <dawagner> On Windows, TortoiseDiff does that pretty well

2011-08-23T16:25:40  <lukeis> wassup jmhon08
2011-08-23T16:25:53  <jmhon08> I have a page that displays all the different emails that my company sends out. A lot of them are very similar. I show and hide different emails by clicking on the names of the emails. I need to verify some text appears on the page AND IS VSIBLE but only if i've revealed that email. how can i do this?
2011-08-23T16:26:19  <jmhon08> i tried doing something like //pre[@id='customer_paid_reservation_request_confirm_body'][contains(text(), 'Service fee = $11.55')], but it doesn't work half the time
2011-08-23T16:26:25  <lukeis> using webdriver or rc?
2011-08-23T16:26:34  <jmhon08> the plain old ide
2011-08-23T16:26:50  <lukeis> esh... umm, know any programming language?
2011-08-23T16:26:55  <jmhon08> yea
2011-08-23T16:27:15  <lukeis> ok, export what you have to one of the WebDriver languages you know
2011-08-23T16:27:21  <jmhon08> ok
2011-08-23T16:27:50  <lukeis> you can locate WebElements and then call the "text" attribute on it to get only the visible text
2011-08-23T16:29:03  <jmhon08> so there's no way to do this thru the ide?
2011-08-23T16:29:25  <lukeis> i don't believe so... but I'm not very fluent with ide
2011-08-23T16:29:36  <jmhon08> i wonder if there's anyhting i can do to the page that i coded
2011-08-23T16:29:40  <jmhon08> like instead of display:none
2011-08-23T16:29:42  <lukeis> isTextPresent or something like that
2011-08-23T16:29:47  <jmhon08> something to make selenium really not see it
