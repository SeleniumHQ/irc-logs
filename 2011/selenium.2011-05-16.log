2011-05-16T04:57:31  <ato> When I do driver.findElement(By.cssSelector(":root")).getText(), is property value on INPUT elements meant to be included?
2011-05-16T05:01:38  <simonstewart> no
2011-05-16T05:02:48  <ato> Alright
2011-05-16T05:03:25  <simonstewart> Jason Leyba argues that "getText" on an input element should return the value
2011-05-16T05:03:45  <simonstewart> But we're all in agreement (so far) that "getText" should generally ignore the text content of inputs

2011-05-16T05:18:26  <jimevans> i was looking at issue #1654, and i was hoping against hope there would be a browser-agnostic solution...
2011-05-16T05:18:27  <selbot2>  open/new IEDriver doesn't scroll and fails to click element in overflow - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1654
2011-05-16T05:18:58  <simonstewart> Don't think that there is.
2011-05-16T05:19:08  <simonstewart> We could be a bit smarter about how we identify where to click
2011-05-16T05:19:09  <jimevans> yeah, didn
2011-05-16T05:19:18  <jimevans> didn't think so either.
2011-05-16T05:19:44  <simonstewart> Was thinking of adding an "elementFromPoint" and cycling through the bounding rects if the element from point doesn't match the one we're trying to click on
2011-05-16T05:20:03  <simonstewart> That, at least, would solve the "click on a hyperlink broken across two lines" problem
2011-05-16T05:20:26  <simonstewart> If none of the points tested are the element we want to click, then clicking at the original location would be best
2011-05-16T05:21:12  <jimevans> i rather thought the advanced interactions api would solve some of that problem, allowing us to click at an offset from 0,0 of an element.
2011-05-16T05:21:20  <simonstewart> indeed
2011-05-16T05:21:38  <simonstewart> but if all we have is "click on this element" then we should make a good attempt to click on that element
2011-05-16T05:21:48  <jimevans> true.
2011-05-16T05:22:21  <simonstewart> And, tbh, the "I can't click on a link" bug gets on my nerves
2011-05-16T05:22:34  <simonstewart> Right now I'm merging in some changes from google to the OSS tree
2011-05-16T05:22:50  <simonstewart> Once I've done that, I may have the time to roll up my sleeves and get down and dirty with clicking code
2011-05-16T05:23:01  <jimevans> shiny. can't wait to see.

2011-05-16T05:58:09  <jimevans> simonstewart: so to make sure i understand the interactions api change, we intend for users to instantiate an Actions object rather than calling ((HasInputDevices)driver).actionsBuilder()?
2011-05-16T05:58:17  <simonstewart> right
2011-05-16T05:58:28  <simonstewart> The idea is that we're providing a toolbox of suitable actions
2011-05-16T05:58:36  <simonstewart> but that users can create their own
2011-05-16T05:58:47  <simonstewart> I view Action and ExpectedCondition in the same way.
2011-05-16T05:58:55  <simonstewart> (there's an ExpectedConditions class here at google)
2011-05-16T05:59:29  <simonstewart> hahaha. *sob*
2011-05-16T05:59:37  <simonstewart> Just found out why this test doesn't work
2011-05-16T05:59:40  *** SL-BWood has joined #selenium
2011-05-16T05:59:42  <simonstewart> Now to unpick the nastiness
2011-05-16T05:59:44  <jimevans> ok. i think i get it.
2011-05-16T05:59:54  <simonstewart> groovy
2011-05-16T06:01:47  <jimevans> eventually, the ActionChainsBuilder interface goes away, right?
2011-05-16T06:01:52  <simonstewart> right
2011-05-16T06:02:52  <jimevans> alright. got to do some .net wackiness due to the lack of covariant interface method implementations.
2011-05-16T06:03:12  <simonstewart> No covariants?
2011-05-16T06:03:29  <simonstewart> I thought those were a side effect of any rational generic implementation
2011-05-16T06:03:53  <jimevans> well, i have an interface (IActionSequenceBuilder), which has methods that return that interface.
2011-05-16T06:04:31  <simonstewart> Ahhh... I see
2011-05-16T06:04:33  <jimevans> However in implementing that interface, I can't declare the method signature to return the implementation, it must return the interface.
2011-05-16T06:04:46  <jimevans> and still satisfy the contract of the interface, that is.
2011-05-16T06:05:21  <jimevans> it'd be easy if i didn't have to deprecate the existing api. :)
2011-05-16T06:05:58  <simonstewart> There's the argument that the user interactions stuff is clearly undergoing chnage
2011-05-16T06:06:09  <simonstewart> and we can list stuff as breaking changes if necessary
2011-05-16T06:06:47  <jimevans> well, at least in .net, it'll show up as a compile error...
2011-05-16T06:06:48  <AutomatedTester> goodday all!
2011-05-16T06:06:58  <jimevans> hi AutomatedTester!
2011-05-16T06:07:07  <ato> AutomatedTester: yo.
2011-05-16T06:07:25  <simonstewart> Hi AutomatedTester
2011-05-16T06:07:58  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: can i pick your brains sometime about the internals of the FirefoxDriver?
2011-05-16T06:08:03  <simonstewart> sure
2011-05-16T06:08:32  <AutomatedTester> i tried it with Firefox 5 and its broked
2011-05-16T06:08:40  <simonstewart> That's a little vague
2011-05-16T06:08:44  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-16T06:09:11  <AutomatedTester> diliberately vague at this moment since I dont have the code in front of me
2011-05-16T06:09:15  <simonstewart> ha
2011-05-16T06:09:30  <AutomatedTester> but what it cant do is start the server
2011-05-16T06:09:43  <simonstewart> Are there any errors reported in the error console?
2011-05-16T06:09:55  <AutomatedTester> yea, variable is undefined
2011-05-16T06:10:11  <AutomatedTester> and the variable is being defined on that line so not really helpful
2011-05-16T06:10:13  <simonstewart> well, that's probably it
2011-05-16T06:10:17  <simonstewart> ahhh....
2011-05-16T06:10:25  <simonstewart> I've not got my lappie with me right now
2011-05-16T06:10:31  <simonstewart> But I'm doing some work at home tonight
2011-05-16T06:10:34  <simonstewart> and might dig in
2011-05-16T06:10:42  <simonstewart> (provided the release goes according to plan()
2011-05-16T06:10:52  <AutomatedTester> cool, I am only starting now so will be working this evening
2011-05-16T06:11:00  <simonstewart> groovy
2011-05-16T06:11:04  <AutomatedTester> when you have time later lets discuss
2011-05-16T06:11:15  <simonstewart> You may also find it useful to get the firefox driver to log to stdout

2011-05-16T06:12:26  <simonstewart> That's a lot of broken
2011-05-16T06:12:34  <AutomatedTester> yes...

2011-05-16T06:12:49  <AutomatedTester> but I will fix
2011-05-16T06:13:19  <Ivog> Is it a requirement to get all tests fixed b4 the release?
2011-05-16T06:13:51  <simonstewart> aye
2011-05-16T06:13:53  <simonstewart> what's failing?
2011-05-16T06:13:59  *** csanchez has joined #selenium

2011-05-16T06:18:46  <simonstewart> interesting
2011-05-16T06:18:58  <simonstewart> Wonder if we ever got native events running cleanly on firefox 4

2011-05-16T06:23:55  <jarib> jimevans: do you ever see flakiness in your implicit waits tests with the IE driver?
2011-05-16T06:24:38  <jimevans> implicit waits? not really. they've been pretty stable. async javascript execution is another matter.
2011-05-16T06:24:41  <simonstewart> Hmmm,.... that was a logical clean up
2011-05-16T06:24:57  <simonstewart> just running the atoms tests for async js execution now
2011-05-16T06:25:09  <simonstewart> IE doesn't like 'em
2011-05-16T06:25:31  <jimevans> i'm not using the atoms for async js execution
2011-05-16T06:25:45  <simonstewart> I'm running the tests with every browser I can lay my hands on
2011-05-16T06:25:56  <jimevans> ah.
2011-05-16T06:31:25  <simonstewart> I hate debugging in IE
2011-05-16T06:31:29  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-05-16T06:31:46  <jimevans> anything i can do to help?
2011-05-16T06:31:59  <simonstewart> It's okay. I should just MTFU
2011-05-16T06:32:06  <simonstewart> How was the cooking show?
2011-05-16T06:32:07  <jimevans> lol.
2011-05-16T06:33:05  <jimevans> it was good. had some really creative desserts
2011-05-16T06:33:23  <simonstewart> nice
2011-05-16T06:33:45  <jimevans> the winner was a bacon-wrapped peanut butter cup "slider"
2011-05-16T06:33:52  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: where did the chocolate go?
2011-05-16T06:33:55  <simonstewart> Sounds revolting
2011-05-16T06:34:43  <jimevans> it does, but it was surpisingly tasty. combination of salty and sweet, plus texture combination of crunch and smooth.
2011-05-16T06:35:04  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: :P
2011-05-16T06:35:38  <simonstewart> No worse than a chocolate orange martini
2011-05-16T06:35:57  <jimevans> hmm. i could see how that would work, actually.
2011-05-16T06:36:24  <jimevans> pairing a sweet chocolate with at tart or bitter fruit is usually a combination that works.
2011-05-16T06:36:57  <jimevans> next chef competition we do will likely be mixology. :)
2011-05-16T06:39:03  <simonstewart> Gah! "Object expected" when "object" is most definitely an "object"
2011-05-16T06:42:45  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: whats that on?
2011-05-16T06:44:28  <simonstewart> IE has grotty semantics around Function objects in JS
2011-05-16T06:44:32  <simonstewart> I think
2011-05-16T06:46:10  <jimevans> i believe you're right there.
2011-05-16T06:47:03  <simonstewart> Interesting. window['Function'] == undefined in IE
2011-05-16T06:47:20  <simonstewart> Wonder where the reference is actually kept.
2011-05-16T06:47:25  <simonstewart> Should be in the global namespace
2011-05-16T06:47:31  <simonstewart> which should be window

2011-05-16T06:48:39  <nirvdrum> Yo.
2011-05-16T06:48:46  <simonstewart> How's it going?
2011-05-16T06:48:46  <jimevans> about the new Actions class in the Java bindings, it looks like it's a "one time use" class. after you call .build() (or .perform(), which calls .build()), the object is no longer valid.
2011-05-16T06:48:58  <jimevans> is this a normal pattern in java?
2011-05-16T06:49:05  <nirvdrum> I just had my pre-op appt..  I'm looking forward to getting my knee fixed.
2011-05-16T06:49:11  <simonstewart> Doesn't it reset its internal state once "build" is called?
2011-05-16T06:49:21  <simonstewart> Knees working == Good
2011-05-16T06:49:26  <simonstewart> Hope that it goes well
2011-05-16T06:49:38  <jimevans> looks like the CompositeAction member variable gets set to null, if i'm reading the code correctly.
2011-05-16T06:49:39  <nirvdrum> So you're letting Eran do the 2.0 release?
2011-05-16T06:49:47  <simonstewart> 2.0rc1
2011-05-16T06:49:49  <simonstewart> yes
2011-05-16T06:49:51  <simonstewart> I'm doing final :)
2011-05-16T06:50:04  <simonstewart> Though, tbh, I wanted to be releasing final about now
2011-05-16T06:50:08  <simonstewart> Oh well
2011-05-16T06:50:26  <nirvdrum> The best laid plans of mice and men oft go astray.
2011-05-16T06:50:44  <simonstewart> Holidays
2011-05-16T06:50:46  <simonstewart> I blame 'em
2011-05-16T06:50:53  <simonstewart> Issue found
2011-05-16T06:50:55  <nirvdrum> I think it was good to go through exercise of planning the 2.0 release.
2011-05-16T06:51:03  <simonstewart> what's to plan?
2011-05-16T06:51:14  <nirvdrum> I go on holiday next week.  But I'm bringing my laptop :-)
2011-05-16T06:51:31  <simonstewart> We won't release 2.0final while you're on holiday
2011-05-16T06:52:00  <nirvdrum> It seemed there wasn't a clearly defined demarcation point for 2.0 final.  At least not one publicly discussed until the release plan email about a month back.
2011-05-16T06:52:42  <simonstewart> I don't think that there really is much of a clear demarcation point
2011-05-16T06:52:44  <nirvdrum> Then I come back and two days later I go in for surgery.  I'll be housebound for 2 weeks.  So plenty of time to muck around with Selenium while dazed on oxycodone I'm sure.
2011-05-16T06:53:09  <simonstewart> I'll compensate with a beer or two
2011-05-16T06:53:18  <simonstewart> Our APIs are now pretty much stable
2011-05-16T06:53:23  <simonstewart> We've implemented a ton of stuff
2011-05-16T06:53:32  <simonstewart> And we're in the process of refining it
2011-05-16T06:53:49  <simonstewart> The major deatures are now more or less there
2011-05-16T06:53:52  <simonstewart> except IDE
2011-05-16T06:54:27  <nirvdrum> I've got a hunch on the grid threading problems.  It's just a bitch to exercise them.  Takes a while to get to the breaking point.
2011-05-16T06:54:44  <simonstewart> Well, no hurry for now
2011-05-16T06:54:52  <jimevans> i'm about to make a unilateral decision to rename the .net equivalent of .switchTo(), .manage(), and .navigate()
2011-05-16T06:54:53  <simonstewart> I'll let rc1 stew for at least 2 weeks
2011-05-16T06:54:55  <nirvdrum> I'd like to get it done.
2011-05-16T06:55:04  <simonstewart> me too
2011-05-16T06:55:05  <nirvdrum> It's software I want to use.
2011-05-16T06:55:13  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: flattening the structure?
2011-05-16T06:55:15  <simonstewart> jimevans: what to?
2011-05-16T06:55:59  <jimevans> idl compliance. those methods are marked as attributes in the proposed idl. i feel very strongly that attributes should be nouns, and methods should be verbs
2011-05-16T06:56:17  <jimevans> and a method that takes no arguments but returns a value is a really good candidate to be an attribute.
2011-05-16T06:56:25  <simonstewart> agreed
2011-05-16T06:56:29  <simonstewart> What names were you looking at?
2011-05-16T06:56:49  <jimevans> manage() => options
2011-05-16T06:57:04  <jimevans> switchTo() => targetLocator
2011-05-16T06:57:26  <jimevans> navigate() is tricky.
2011-05-16T06:57:35  <simonstewart> Think about how the tests will read
2011-05-16T06:57:42  <simonstewart> manage -> options looks fine
2011-05-16T06:57:53  <jimevans> tempted to call it "navigator" but that's potentally confusing with the browser attribute
2011-05-16T06:58:02  <simonstewart> But "switchTo" and "navigate" were picked deliberately
2011-05-16T06:58:12  <jimevans> yeah, in java that'd translate to "getOptions"
2011-05-16T06:58:32  <jimevans> you're using a fluent interface there, and i get the advantages of it.
2011-05-16T06:58:36  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-16T06:58:45  <simonstewart> what about our users?
2011-05-16T06:58:50  <simonstewart> What's easiest for them?
2011-05-16T06:59:30  *** larrys has joined #selenium
2011-05-16T06:59:47  <jimevans> well from a .net perspective (the one i know best), i don't think anyone would balk at driver.TargetLocator.SwitchToWindow('foo')
2011-05-16T07:00:11  <simonstewart> It's kind of ugly
2011-05-16T07:00:34  <simonstewart> But the solutions I can think of are verbs
2011-05-16T07:00:38  <simonstewart> "driver.use"?
2011-05-16T07:00:48  <simonstewart> driver.use.window
2011-05-16T07:00:55  <simonstewart> driver.use.activeElement
2011-05-16T07:00:57  <jimevans> then change the idl to be a method.
2011-05-16T07:01:05  <simonstewart> I could do that :)
2011-05-16T07:01:23  <simonstewart> If it was a no-arg method would that be better?
2011-05-16T07:02:11  <jimevans> from a "spec compliance" perspective, it's easier to answer the implementation question "why did you make this a method instead of a property?"
2011-05-16T07:02:30  <simonstewart> Then let's make that change
2011-05-16T07:02:36  <jimevans> the answer then becomes, "because the spec says so."
2011-05-16T07:02:41  <simonstewart> hahaha
2011-05-16T07:02:47  <jimevans> :)
2011-05-16T07:04:00  <barancev> anybody tested IEDriver upload function on non-English version of the browser?
2011-05-16T07:04:08  <jimevans> i'm sure there are at least a couple of places in the .net implementation of the XML DOM that could have been implemented in a more .NET-idiomatic way but for the W3C spec
2011-05-16T07:04:23  <simonstewart> barancev: I'm not
2011-05-16T07:04:26  <barancev> I'm having problems with Russian localized version
2011-05-16T07:04:28  <simonstewart> jimevans: damn languages
2011-05-16T07:04:56  <barancev> Selenium don't want to click Open button in dialog window (that is Открыть actually :))
2011-05-16T07:05:27  <jimevans> yeah there should've been a comment to that effect in the code, but there's not.

2011-05-16T07:06:08  <barancev> do you use titles to find buttons?

2011-05-16T07:06:27  <barancev> damn!
2011-05-16T07:07:04  <barancev> is there a chance it can be changed in future?

2011-05-16T07:08:18  <jimevans> the dialog changes from version-to-version of windows.

2011-05-16T07:12:40  <jimevans> if there's a cross-language, cross-version method for identifying what we need to, why would it need to be configurable exactly?
2011-05-16T07:13:39  <barancev> is there such a method?
2011-05-16T07:14:41  <jimevans> i don't know. i'll need to research it. if worse comes to worst, we could probably query the resources for the string printed on the open button.
2011-05-16T07:14:56  *** skiphuffman_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-16T07:16:23  <barancev> but you need to find it prior to query resources
2011-05-16T07:16:50  <jimevans> no, you query the dll for the resources, given the resource id.
2011-05-16T07:18:05  <jimevans> gah, my previously beautifully clean build now has a ton of warnings thanks to deprecation!
2011-05-16T07:18:17  <barancev> aha, yes, I see

2011-05-16T07:21:27  <simonstewart> I've been there before
2011-05-16T07:21:32  <nirvdrum> Any thoughts on whether WindowsProxyManager should disable IE8 compatibility mode for IE9 by default?

2011-05-16T07:21:52  <simonstewart> nirvdrum, it should probably leave that setting alone
2011-05-16T07:22:05  <simonstewart> I don't think our users toy with it

2011-05-16T07:25:52  <nirvdrum> Ivog: I don't think it is in this case, but that could be client specific.  I'm seeing clients just basically block waiting for a request slot to become available.
2011-05-16T07:26:56  <Ivog> I thought that was correct behavior
2011-05-16T07:27:30  <Ivog> New sess request can't be handled until a slot is available
2011-05-16T07:27:33  <nirvdrum> The problem is they keep piling up and prevent the nodes from talking to the hub.
2011-05-16T07:27:49  <nirvdrum> So you have a bad situation that is guaranteed to get worse.
2011-05-16T07:28:02  <nirvdrum> You can't even bring up new nodes to help out with the load.
2011-05-16T07:28:08  <Ivog> Ah ok :s
2011-05-16T07:28:25  <freynaud> have you been able to troubleshoot the running out of thread isssue Kevin ?
2011-05-16T07:28:31  <Ivog> I see
2011-05-16T07:28:42  <nirvdrum> freynaud: Not yet.  But I will soon :-)
2011-05-16T07:28:59  <nirvdrum> What would be ideal is if jetty allows different thread pools per context.
2011-05-16T07:29:06  <nirvdrum> I have no idea if it does or not.
2011-05-16T07:29:14  <freynaud> the part i don't get
2011-05-16T07:29:21  <freynaud> is why it worked for grid1
2011-05-16T07:29:32  <freynaud> the thread were waiting for a session too
2011-05-16T07:30:44  <nirvdrum> Grid 1 was more proactive about killing off clients.  There was a setting whereby if a client didn't get a browser session within X seconds it would raise an exception.
2011-05-16T07:32:11  <Ivog> But that aint good either
2011-05-16T07:32:11  <Ivog> Isn't
2011-05-16T07:32:35  <nirvdrum> It worked well for me.
2011-05-16T07:32:53  <freynaud> that could be added in grid2
2011-05-16T07:33:00  <freynaud> that would reduce the issue
2011-05-16T07:33:10  <freynaud> but that's still relying on luck
2011-05-16T07:33:24  <freynaud> if you have a huge burst of incoming test, the timeout won't help
2011-05-16T07:33:46  <nirvdrum> If my test isn't serviced in 5 min., I'm happy to kill it off.  But since an exception was raised, I could handle it (maybe bring up new nodes) and then requeue the request.
2011-05-16T07:33:54  <nirvdrum> It afforded the developer flexibility.
2011-05-16T07:34:03  <freynaud> i'd rather have what you said previously
2011-05-16T07:34:06  <AutomatedTester> patches for svn from git svn won't work?
2011-05-16T07:34:18  <freynaud> keep a number of thread for the nodes
2011-05-16T07:34:24  <freynaud> then the rest for the tests
2011-05-16T07:34:37  <freynaud> so that if jetty runs out of thread, it crashes a test
2011-05-16T07:34:40  <freynaud> not a node

2011-05-16T08:38:25  <barancev> yes, unrelated, I've seen it before in english version too
2011-05-16T08:38:30  <jimevans> however, i strongly suspect you're running into an ie behaviour that causes ie to track the actual mouse pointer position.
2011-05-16T08:39:29  <jimevans> the symptom in that particular test is that you see the element appear on hover, but then it quickly disappears.
2011-05-16T08:39:47  <jimevans> if you physically do not have the mouse pointer over the ie window at the time the test runs, it passes.

2011-05-16T11:05:25  <jimevans> *sigh* windows is really brain dead when it comes to simulating user input.
2011-05-16T11:05:31  <simonstewart> How come?
2011-05-16T11:06:05  <jimevans> let me count the ways...
2011-05-16T11:06:06  <jimevans> mouse clicks can be ignored if the window in question isn't in focus
2011-05-16T11:06:31  <jimevans> sometimes backspace keystrokes can get sent to the top-level window instead of the focused control
2011-05-16T11:07:12  *** cgoldberg has joined #selenium
2011-05-16T11:07:13  <simonstewart> jimevans: selects in IE 6 have that problem
2011-05-16T11:07:25  *** santiycr has joined #selenium
2011-05-16T11:07:32  <jimevans> sending a mouse move operation (simulating a hover) doesn't work if the actual mouse pointer is somewhere else over the window
2011-05-16T11:07:53  <jimevans> have which problem? :)
2011-05-16T11:08:07  <simonstewart> The select is rendered as a separate hwnd
2011-05-16T11:08:26  <simonstewart> so when you attempt to click on it, the coordinates are right, but the receiving window is wrong
2011-05-16T11:08:52  <simonstewart> Is eranm around yet?
2011-05-16T11:09:03  <eranm> But of course
2011-05-16T11:09:09  <jimevans> there's a great windows api (SendInput) that's super reliable for generating keystrokes and mouse events...
2011-05-16T11:09:22  <simonstewart> If the AUT has focus
2011-05-16T11:09:24  <jimevans> except it *requires* the window you want to send the input to to have focus.
2011-05-16T11:09:31  <simonstewart> true
2011-05-16T11:09:40  <simonstewart> eranm: so, how's the release looking?
2011-05-16T11:09:49  <simonstewart> I hear of problems with the build of Firefox 4 on Win7
2011-05-16T11:10:11  <eranm> I haven't tested this configuration yet - who reported these problems?
2011-05-16T11:10:24  <simonstewart> It was on the IRC channel earlier
2011-05-16T11:10:32  <simonstewart> Looks like a nasty problem with native events
2011-05-16T11:10:47  <jimevans> sending and/or posting messages to the application message queue is probably the best one can do, but it's unreliable
2011-05-16T11:10:55  <jimevans> (see http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/30/423202.aspx)
2011-05-16T11:11:05  <simonstewart> Until MS agree that we're on to something
2011-05-16T11:11:28  <eranm> simonstewart: As I've told you, I believe native events are not working on Firefox 4. I'll verify it later on.
2011-05-16T11:11:42  <simonstewart> s/later on/before release/
2011-05-16T11:12:11  * jarib can confirm native events are not working on firefox 4
2011-05-16T11:12:53  <eranm> Once the current suite of tests is done :)
2011-05-16T11:12:58  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-16T11:13:17  <simonstewart> I tend to run firefox 3, 3.5, 3.6, 4 on linux
2011-05-16T11:13:23  <simonstewart> latest firefox on Win7
2011-05-16T11:13:31  <simonstewart> And then IE 9 on Win 7
2011-05-16T11:13:43  <simonstewart> jimevans is far more thorough about running the IE builds than I am
2011-05-16T11:13:53  <simonstewart> So when he says that they're good to go, I take his word
2011-05-16T11:14:14  <simonstewart> jarib can give you the nod if there are any problems with the ruby bindings
2011-05-16T11:14:35  <simonstewart> and AutomatedTester tends to be the person who lets us know that python is ready
2011-05-16T11:14:40  <barancev|2> I'm on win7
2011-05-16T11:15:02  <simonstewart> freynaud and nirvdrum can tell you for sure whether grid 2.0 is ready for some more beta testers
2011-05-16T11:15:15  <simonstewart> Build on a Linux machine
2011-05-16T11:15:23  <simonstewart> And make sure that all the prebuilts are up to date :)
2011-05-16T11:15:36  <barancev|2> and I run tests on trunk regularly
2011-05-16T11:15:42  <simonstewart> Cool
2011-05-16T11:16:09  <simonstewart> eranm: you'll also need to update the docs
2011-05-16T11:16:16  <simonstewart> (javadocs)
2011-05-16T11:16:18  <barancev|2> ... but they rare run to the end :)
2011-05-16T11:16:21  <eranm> ok
2011-05-16T11:16:25  <simonstewart> which is always a deeply tedious thing to do
2011-05-16T11:17:21  <simonstewart> If you mail me a release announcement, I can put it up on the blog
2011-05-16T11:17:34  <simonstewart> adamgoucher tends to make the noise on the official selenium twitter client
2011-05-16T11:17:40  <simonstewart> s/client/account/
2011-05-16T11:18:09  <jimevans> simonstewart: oh, yeah, i verified that the Actions class is, at present, "use once then you have to discard"
2011-05-16T11:18:19  * jarib imagines simonstewart now sitting back, sipping his pina colada
2011-05-16T11:18:30  * simonstewart is working on fixing code
2011-05-16T11:18:34  * simonstewart never sleeps
2011-05-16T11:18:40  <eranm> ok, so if I understand correctly, according to jimevans the IE build for r12188 is good and according to jarib the ruby bindings are ox
2011-05-16T11:18:42  <eranm> ok

2011-05-16T11:53:00  <simonstewart> jarib: jason reverted it because a bunch of people were making assumptions that weren't right

2011-05-16T11:54:00  <simonstewart> So, let's go back to first principles
2011-05-16T11:54:04  <simonstewart> given this HTML
2011-05-16T11:54:10  <simonstewart> <a href="foo">
2011-05-16T11:54:27  <simonstewart> What do you expect "element.getAttribute("href")" to return?
2011-05-16T11:54:35  <simonstewart> Before any special case handling
2011-05-16T11:54:40  <simonstewart> firefox returns "foo"
2011-05-16T11:54:43  <AutomatedTester> whats in the href
2011-05-16T11:54:45  <simonstewart> IE returns the full URL
2011-05-16T11:54:48  <AutomatedTester> thats what I expect
2011-05-16T11:55:06  * AutomatedTester understands the change
2011-05-16T11:55:09  <simonstewart> But that's not what's returned from browsers
2011-05-16T11:55:12  * AutomatedTester is happy with it
2011-05-16T11:55:15  <simonstewart> :)
2011-05-16T11:55:27  <simonstewart> The change is for the sake of consistency (cf: boolean values)
2011-05-16T11:55:34  <AutomatedTester> it means my test is out of date or there is a bug
2011-05-16T11:55:50  <simonstewart> The problem is that lots of people only test on firefox and expect everything to work the same way
2011-05-16T11:55:51  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-05-16T11:56:12  <AutomatedTester> damn them for using a good browser for testing
2011-05-16T11:56:13  <simonstewart> I think it's something we'll need to call out in the release notes
2011-05-16T11:56:16  <AutomatedTester> damn them I say!
2011-05-16T11:56:23  <simonstewart> damn them for only using one browser
2011-05-16T11:56:35  <AutomatedTester> never mind, the test is passing now
2011-05-16T11:56:46  <simonstewart> woot!
2011-05-16T11:57:16  <AutomatedTester> it was failing yesterday
2011-05-16T11:57:24  <simonstewart> Time, eh
2011-05-16T11:57:28  <simonstewart> can't live with it
2011-05-16T11:57:36  <simonstewart> don't realise that it exists without it
2011-05-16T11:57:53  <jarib> so what are the special cases?
2011-05-16T11:58:03  <simonstewart> <a href> and <img src>
2011-05-16T11:58:04  <simonstewart> so far
2011-05-16T11:58:09  <simonstewart> I suspect that there may be more
2011-05-16T11:58:11  <simonstewart> script?
2011-05-16T11:58:18  <simonstewart> But those two are the only ones so far
2011-05-16T11:58:22  <jarib> ah, special cased to fetch the property instead of the attribute
2011-05-16T11:58:27  <simonstewart> right
2011-05-16T11:58:34  <AutomatedTester> ok my firefox tests pass
2011-05-16T11:58:45  <simonstewart> nice
2011-05-16T11:58:51  <AutomatedTester> and since we only test that lets ship
2011-05-16T11:59:18  <simonstewart> Native events on firefox 4 on Win 7?
2011-05-16T11:59:21  <eranm> simonstewart: so currently Firefox would return 'foo' ?
2011-05-16T11:59:31  <simonstewart> eranm: right now? No
2011-05-16T11:59:36  <simonstewart> Until recently, yes
2011-05-16T11:59:54  <eranm> be back soon, lunch.
2011-05-16T11:59:56  <simonstewart> (read the webdriver JS I linked to ^^ up there)
2011-05-16T12:00:17  <simonstewart> I need to head off too
2011-05-16T12:00:36  <simonstewart> Can someone please make sure that the release occurs only once native events on Firefox 4 on Win 7 are working?
2011-05-16T12:00:55  <simonstewart> I'd rather wait a day and get it right rather than rush for the sake of rushing
2011-05-16T12:00:58  <simonstewart> Toodle pip!

2011-05-16T12:10:17  <ivog> 4.01
2011-05-16T12:10:41  <jimevans> could it be related to the fact that native events don't work on firefox 4?

2011-05-16T12:27:21  <barancev|2> so it is a cross-platform bug :)
2011-05-16T12:27:35  <AutomatedTester> jarib: people we outsource to have spotted it too
2011-05-16T12:27:42  <AutomatedTester> they were doing Se1
2011-05-16T12:28:01  <jarib> probably something to do with an unclean shutdown

2011-05-16T12:28:47  <AutomatedTester> jarib: more likely from a unclean startup somehow
2011-05-16T12:28:59  <AutomatedTester> since teardowns *shouldnt* affect the next profile
2011-05-16T12:29:07  <jarib> hmm, true
2011-05-16T12:29:37  <jarib> unless it's the 'clean the profile' process that isn't shutting down properly
2011-05-16T12:29:51  <jarib> i.e. the first launch
2011-05-16T12:29:57  <AutomatedTester> could be
2011-05-16T12:30:28  <jarib> so it's more like a 'mess up this profile' launch, one could say :)
2011-05-16T12:31:32  <jarib> barancev|2: it's the first time i've heard of it on any platform besides OS X though
2011-05-16T12:32:25  <jarib> and i've never seen it happen in our builds, which are linux only
2011-05-16T12:32:38  <barancev|2> AutomatedTester: what platform have your outsourcers seen it on?
2011-05-16T12:32:47  <AutomatedTester> barancev|2: windows

2011-05-16T12:49:37  <barancev|2> it seems to me that FormHandlingTest.testShouldSubmitAFormUsingTheNewlineLiteral contains a bug here: input.sendKeys("\n"); assertEquals("We Arrive Here", driver.getTitle());
2011-05-16T12:50:06  <barancev|2> it should be waitFor(pageTitleToBe(driver, "We Arrive Here")); like it is in testShouldSubmitAFormUsingTheEnterKey

2011-05-16T13:16:07  <eranm> Nope :)
2011-05-16T13:16:22  <jarib> k :)
2011-05-16T13:16:38  <eranm> Part of the work is converting the native code to use gecko 2 - that's not a lot of work, I've done that.
2011-05-16T13:17:10  <jarib> the problem was supporting both 3 and 4, no?
2011-05-16T13:17:22  <eranm> but the rest is actually getting it to work - there are still problems getting the native window handle in Firefox 4 (and the native component built using Gecko 2 does not work on any version of Firefox).
2011-05-16T13:17:36  <jarib> i see
2011-05-16T13:19:12  <eranm> I'll create an issue for it later with my changes, in case somebody wants to collaborate

2011-05-16T13:21:50  <barancev|2> and JavascriptEnabledDriverTest.testShouldBeAbleToFindElementAfterJavascriptCausesANewPageToLoad seems to be similar
2011-05-16T13:22:31  <barancev|2> javascript causes a new page to load, but selenium performs all check before page is actually loaded
2011-05-16T13:23:16  <eranm> barancev|2: do you see intermittent failures in these tests?
2011-05-16T13:24:08  <barancev|2> eranm: yes, in FormHandlingTest.testShouldSubmitAFormUsingTheNewlineLiteral
2011-05-16T13:24:41  <barancev|2> eranm: JavascriptEnabledDriverTest.testShouldBeAbleToFindElementAfterJavascriptCausesANewPageToLoad fails every time I run it
2011-05-16T13:25:07  <eranm> ok
2011-05-16T13:25:36  <barancev|2> eranm: but when I added thread.sleep for a couple of seconds before check, it passed
2011-05-16T13:27:34  <barancev|2> yet I don't know what's correct behavior - may be selenium should wait for page to load automatically in testShouldBeAbleToFindElementAfterJavascriptCausesANewPageToLoad

2011-05-16T13:29:55  <eranm> barancev|2: that's difficult - Selenium tries to auto-detect cases where clicking an element would cause a page reload and wait, I think it's more difficult for javascript.
2011-05-16T13:32:37  <barancev|2> eranm: who is in power to make a decision about this test? is it a bug that should be fixed, or is it possible to make test less demanding?
2011-05-16T13:33:28  <eranm> The test should be changed to be more flexible and wait for the right condition
2011-05-16T13:33:46  <AutomatedTester> eranm: you going to hate me when I say Fx5 is 5 weeks away if you are having issues with Native Events...

2011-05-16T14:26:12  <ivog> jarib: if i look here it seems the only agent up is the osx agent http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/agent/viewAgents.action
2011-05-16T14:27:05  <ivog> ah it seems up now...
2011-05-16T14:27:18  <ivog> jarib thx
2011-05-16T14:28:06  <jarib> i'll restart the linux one as well
2011-05-16T14:28:43  <ivog> it seems the python builds killed the agents last time
2011-05-16T14:29:13  <ivog> it there some way they can be made manual started builds for now?

2011-05-16T14:29:50  <jarib> the ps output on the linux vm had some references to S2PY-FFLX-JOB1

2011-05-16T14:33:25  <jarib> adding more builds to bamboo may not have been the best idea.. the VMs are all a bit low on disk space i believe
2011-05-16T14:35:56  <ivog> ah ok, i guess that could explain a shutdown somehow...
2011-05-16T14:37:11  <jarib> i think the sane course of action would be to set up all the VMs from scratch, and then only run a really simple configuration
2011-05-16T14:37:33  <jarib> like only java firefox tests on linux
2011-05-16T14:38:12  <jarib> and only add more when that's stable
2011-05-16T14:38:23  *** red^ is now known as reddeviL
2011-05-16T14:38:26  <eranm> good idea, jarib
2011-05-16T14:39:03  <eranm> nirvdrum: so what is the best course of action regarding the failing grid tests?
2011-05-16T14:39:40  <nirvdrum> I'd really need freynaud to weigh in.  Otherwise I can try to take a stab at fixing it.  But like I said, I don't know the history of that test or what it's supposed to be doing.
2011-05-16T14:40:06  <nirvdrum> It may be sensible to disable it.  Obviously the bug would still be there, but you could build at least.

2011-05-16T14:41:46  <eranm> Since I'm not going to release RC1 today, there's no real point in that.

2011-05-16T14:43:38  <ivog> which test is failing for u eranm? when i run the grid tests they seem to all work
2011-05-16T14:43:48  <nirvdrum> eranm: Thanks.
2011-05-16T14:44:13  <eranm> ivog: the DefaultToFIFOPriorityTest (have a look at http://pastebin.com/Fp4E7vi6)
2011-05-16T14:45:09  <eranm> ivog: do you work with Francois on the grid?
2011-05-16T14:45:52  <ivog> no, im just interested in grid and trying to help whenever i can
2011-05-16T14:47:04  <eranm> That's very welcome.
2011-05-16T14:47:17  <ivog> im using grid2 at home and trying to work through problems with francois
2011-05-16T14:47:21  <ivog> at work
2011-05-16T14:50:54  <ivog> i've got 372 tests passing for grid including the DefaultToFIFOPriorityTest...
2011-05-16T14:51:35  <eghm_> ivog: what was it like upgrading from 1 to 2?
2011-05-16T14:53:42  <barancev|2> ivog: I have the same test failed as Eran has
2011-05-16T14:53:58  <barancev|2> I'm on Win7
2011-05-16T14:53:59  <eranm> ivog, barancev|2 : which environments are you using?
2011-05-16T14:54:03  <ivog> eghm: i've upgraded to webdriver first and after that to grid, after some small problems it runs pretty well right nwo
2011-05-16T14:54:17  <lisak> why there is only org.seleniumhq.selenium selenium 2.0b1  maven artifact ?
2011-05-16T14:54:31  <ivog> im on win7 64
2011-05-16T14:54:45  <lisak> and b2 and b3 is not deployed yet ?
2011-05-16T14:55:30  <eghm_> ivog: you were able to run webdriver under 1? or was that when you went to 2?
2011-05-16T14:55:34  <eranm> ok, the test was failing for me on Mac.
2011-05-16T14:55:43  *** eghm_ is now known as eghm
2011-05-16T14:58:43  <barancev|2> eghm: webdriver api is a part of selenium 2.0, it is absent from selenium 1
2011-05-16T14:59:27  <barancev|2> eghm: selenium 2.0 is backward compatible, it includes "classic" selenium rc api
2011-05-16T15:00:48  <barancev|2> eghm: and in addition it has an option for smooth transition from "classic" to webdriver -- WebDriverBackedSelenium that has 1.0-style api and 2.0 webdriver engine inside
2011-05-16T15:01:18  <eghm> cool, that will make the upgrade easier, thanks
2011-05-16T15:04:31  <eranm> eghm: note that not all of the Selenium 1 Javascript API is implemented with the WebDriverBackedSelenium - so if your tests eval() a lot of code digging into the selenium core, some things will break. Otherwise, we'd be interested to hear your experience report of the migration.

2011-05-16T15:41:28  <ivog> this is a good start anyways
2011-05-16T15:41:38  <jarib> which means we would be able to separate actual code problems from env issues
2011-05-16T15:41:48  <ivog> better have a little reliable information then alot of crappy info
2011-05-16T15:42:02  <jarib> yeah, that's what i'm thinking
