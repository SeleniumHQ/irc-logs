2011-09-23T02:15:11  <andreastt> Good morning
2011-09-23T02:16:06  <barancev> ave!
2011-09-23T02:16:13  <simonstewart> Greetings!
2011-09-23T02:16:26  <simonstewart> So: do we push 2.7 today, or wait until Monday?
2011-09-23T02:17:21  <andreastt> We're all ready from Opera.  Nothing pending.
2011-09-23T02:18:09  <andreastt> jarib: I also seem to be getting a lot of ‚ÄúAddress already in use‚Äù messages, do you know what this might come from?
2011-09-23T02:21:11  <jarib> andreastt: there's no simple way to run a single test atm. you could probably change rake-tasks/crazy_fun/mappings/ruby.rb:105 to pass -e if some env var is set
2011-09-23T02:21:12  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-09-23T02:21:26  <jarib> so you could do ./go //rb:opera-test onlyrun="some example name"
2011-09-23T02:21:45  <jarib> as for the socket error, what's the stacktrace?

2011-09-23T02:23:54  <andreastt> jarib: https://gist.github.com/1237037
2011-09-23T02:24:09  <andreastt> I suspect that the first test in that file I just created isn't shutting down the remote driver?
2011-09-23T02:25:46  <jarib> yeah, that looks likely

2011-09-23T02:26:32  *** ian_mac_ has joined #selenium
2011-09-23T02:27:37  <jarib> andreastt: but it looks like a problem connecting to opera (since Opera::Service picks a random port for the server, running several shouldn't be a problem)
2011-09-23T02:28:02  <jarib> so there's probably a hardcoded port in OperaDriver somewhere?
2011-09-23T02:28:13  *** stockton has quit IRC
2011-09-23T02:28:27  <jarib> (the error is thrown the server)
2011-09-23T02:28:34  <andreastt> You can't run more than one OperaDriver currently.
2011-09-23T02:28:56  <andreastt> This is true.
2011-09-23T02:29:21  <andreastt> But shouldn't the remote server be shutdown automatically by the lambda?
2011-09-23T02:29:53  <jarib> hmm
2011-09-23T02:30:04  <jarib> with an invalid argument, i guess it shouldn't start at all
2011-09-23T02:30:42  *** davehunt has joined #selenium
2011-09-23T02:31:01  <andreastt> Good point.
2011-09-23T02:32:28  <jarib> you should just move @service.start a couple of lines down in Opera::Bridge
2011-09-23T02:32:50  <jarib> the argument check is happening in create_capabilities
2011-09-23T02:32:57  <jarib> no need to start the server before that
2011-09-23T02:35:50  <barancev> I'd say it is a good think to release today, because 2.6.0 has serious flaws that have to be closed asap

2011-09-23T03:58:26  <andreastt> I notice that selenium-webdriver is expecting #style("color") (or, in Java  WebElement.getElementValueOfCssProperty("color")) to return a HEX value, instead Opera is returning an RGB value.
2011-09-23T03:58:39  <jarib> same in chrome
2011-09-23T03:58:39  <andreastt> Should we convert from RGB to HEX?
2011-09-23T03:59:05  <jarib> it'd be nice if it was consistent
2011-09-23T03:59:54  <silastic> I am using firefox 3.6 and selnium 2.5 and I have an element which only becomes visible if you hover over it. what is the best way to do this?
2011-09-23T04:01:11  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-09-23T04:01:21  <jarib> andreastt: the socket problem is probably the driver launched by other specs (in TestEnvironment). your specs assume you can launch several browsers, basically

2011-09-23T04:05:24  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC

2011-09-23T04:06:09  <jarib> as long as it's consistent across browsers, it's fine by me.
2011-09-23T04:06:10  <andreastt> If we do the alpha as a HEX, it will look like this:
2011-09-23T04:06:11  <andreastt> another 2 digits of hex, but then #00FF00FF == #00FF00

2011-09-23T04:16:14  <jarib> andreastt: in your driver_spec.rb, try before(:each) { GlobalTestEnv.quit_driver rescue nil } and see if that solves your problem
2011-09-23T04:17:04  <jarib> (the rescue is needed since TestEnvironment#quit_driver can only be called once per driver, so if the before hook solves your problem we should fix that as well)
2011-09-23T04:17:09  <andreastt> jarib: Just added after(:all) { driver.quit } to element_spec.rb, and that did the trick.
2011-09-23T04:17:14  <andreastt> jarib: But is your approach better?

2011-09-23T04:18:45  <jarib> yours is dependent on the specs running in that specific order

2011-09-23T04:28:11  <andreastt> About colours, maybe the right solution would be to return some Color interface.
2011-09-23T04:28:32  <andreastt> Then one could query that for HEX or RGB(a) values as needed.
2011-09-23T04:29:03  <andreastt> .getCssValue("color").getHex() for instance.

2011-09-23T04:38:34  <jarib> also in the static typed languages, having getCssValue return different types based on the argument is problematic
2011-09-23T04:38:45  <andreastt> Should something either be done about http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html or about removing the ‚ÄúFor documentation on this error, please visit: http://seleniumhq.org/exceptions/no_such_element.html‚Äù string that is thrown on NoSuchElementError?
2011-09-23T04:38:53  <jarib> you'd have to do getCssValueAsColor or similar
2011-09-23T04:39:12  <andreastt> You could cast it to a color object if you knew what you were looking for.
2011-09-23T04:39:32  <jarib> i think the simple getCssValue -> best effort string is good enough for most use cases, if people want to inspect HSL colors etc they can always use executeScript
2011-09-23T04:39:34  <andreastt> I see your point about simplicity.
2011-09-23T04:39:58  <andreastt> But we have to make sure our approach covers all scenarios.
2011-09-23T04:40:04  <jarib> then it would need to return Object, no? which means you'll have to cast it to String in most cases
2011-09-23T04:40:32  <jarib> s/return Object/have Object as the return signature/
2011-09-23T04:40:35  <andreastt> If already in a string context, wouldn't Java autoboxing take care of that?

2011-09-23T08:17:16  <selbot2> luke.semerau@gmail.com half a minute ago - LukeIS: reverting change to selenium examles due to bug in 2.6, all better with 2.7 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13938
2011-09-23T08:17:41  <simonstewart> Thanks lukeis
2011-09-23T08:17:44  <jarib> though since it's a volunteer effort and they have a limited amount of hardware (from sponsors), we'd probably have to donate our hardware as a worker
2011-09-23T08:17:44  <mashiara> is there a good way to get the http status code with webdriver ?
2011-09-23T08:17:44  <Dude-X> is java webdriver 2.7 out?

2011-09-23T10:21:32  *** pnitin has quit IRC
2011-09-23T10:27:00  <barancev> jqp: why do you want test methods to return page objects?
2011-09-23T10:27:25  <barancev> you don't call test methods, TestNG does
2011-09-23T10:28:37  *** voodoofish1 has joined #selenium
2011-09-23T10:28:57  <jqp> barancev: that's the only way i can think of to test a workflow using TestNG/page objects, etc.
2011-09-23T10:29:22  <barancev> if you want a reusable piece of code - create a regular method that returns page object, call it from a test method and check the result (or ignore it)
2011-09-23T10:29:37  <barancev> you never call test methods directly
2011-09-23T10:30:16  <barancev> if you want to pass data from a test method to amother test method use fields
2011-09-23T10:30:24  <jqp> are there examples of how to do this with TestNG, java, and page objects?
2011-09-23T10:30:42  <barancev> but you'd better avoid dependencies, isolate you test methods
2011-09-23T10:32:13  <barancev> :wiki PageObjects
2011-09-23T10:32:13  <selbot2> 1: PageObjects: The Page Object pattern represents the screens of your web app as a series of objects - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects
2011-09-23T10:32:38  <barancev> just add "≈Û˚Â annotation before a test method to mark it a TestNG test
2011-09-23T10:32:51  <barancev> sorry, @Test annotation
2011-09-23T10:33:37  <jqp> would you say the example at http://testng.org/doc/selenium.html violates the notion that test methods should avoid dependencies, and be isolated?
2011-09-23T10:36:26  <barancev> yes, I'd say it is a bad example
2011-09-23T10:36:36  <jqp> :-/
2011-09-23T10:37:41  <barancev> if you have a single test failed all the following are failed too, domino effect
2011-09-23T10:39:19  <barancev> avoid @Test(dependsOn) and preserve-order="true" if possible
2011-09-23T10:39:42  <jqp> right, but say there's a sequential workflow that has only 1 defined path through a UI.  if void-returning methods were used to test that, then my impression is that each task/step in the workflow would need its own test such that all preceding tasks/steps would need to be reproduced
2011-09-23T10:40:39  <barancev> if it is a single workflow what's the purpose of splitting it to a set of small tests?
2011-09-23T10:41:06  <jqp> to test each task in the workflow
2011-09-23T10:41:34  <barancev> why do you want each test to be a separate test method?
2011-09-23T10:41:51  <barancev> s/each test/each step/
2011-09-23T10:42:05  <jqp> so that i can annotate each test method with @Test, and get TestNG reports on each of them
2011-09-23T10:42:29  <barancev> make them regular methods and create a test as a sequence of calls
2011-09-23T10:43:02  <barancev> in any case you'll get a single fail in the report
2011-09-23T10:44:01  <jqp> right, but with those smaller task-specific tests i would know where it failed without having to consult a stack trace
2011-09-23T10:44:36  <barancev> well, it you want each step a row in the report you may use this approach
2011-09-23T10:45:09  <barancev> if you have an explanation for your chioce - it comes to be a good practice :)
2011-09-23T10:45:36  <jqp> but i think using void-returning methods to achieve that would be incredibly inefficient
2011-09-23T10:46:06  <krosenvold> Do we have any kind of proxy/stub that can be used to represent a misbehaving remote (at JSON level or similar) ?
2011-09-23T10:46:23  <barancev> instead you may use assertEquals(actual, expected, "The two text here and there are not the same!!!")
2011-09-23T10:46:23  <krosenvold> (For a test)
2011-09-23T10:46:57  <barancev> and you'll get a message that claims what's wrong, no need to investigate stack trace either
2011-09-23T10:47:37  <jqp> right, but i feel like that's not doing TestNG the right way
2011-09-23T10:48:01  <barancev> testng in not chaining test methods
2011-09-23T10:48:20  <barancev> use fields
2011-09-23T10:48:33  <jqp> what do you mean by 'fields'?
2011-09-23T10:48:55  <barancev> class members that store values
2011-09-23T10:49:19  <XRayCulver> jqp: i have a similar situation to you
2011-09-23T10:49:25  <XRayCulver> i have a checkpoint manager
2011-09-23T10:49:25  *** jeichar has quit IRC
2011-09-23T10:49:36  <XRayCulver> that creates database snapshots at reuasable data checkpoints
2011-09-23T10:49:57  <XRayCulver> during the tests, the tests checks if the checkpoint has been created yet, if it hasn't it runs the steps to create it
2011-09-23T10:50:05  <XRayCulver> so those steps only get run once
2011-09-23T10:50:10  <XRayCulver> but it does create a dependency
2011-09-23T10:50:33  <XRayCulver> but i'f i'm failing at a level thats causing many tests to fail it woudn't matter anyways
2011-09-23T10:50:48  <XRayCulver> its like you said, they depend either way and would fail if i repeated it or not
2011-09-23T10:51:15  <XRayCulver> just saves on test lenght
2011-09-23T10:51:21  <XRayCulver> and cuts out the repeating parts

2011-09-23T10:52:20  *** andialbrecht_ is now known as andialbrecht
2011-09-23T10:52:23  <barancev> 1) use injection frameworks like guice
2011-09-23T10:53:36  <jqp> XRayCulver: right.  my concern about void-returning test methods is that in a hypothetical 1-path workflow comprised of tasks A, B and C, to test each task would require running testA to test A, then running test B to test A and B, then running test C to test A then B then C
2011-09-23T10:54:49  <barancev> 2) try something like JDave: http://jdave.org/examples.html
2011-09-23T10:55:30  *** andialbrecht is now known as andialbrecht_
2011-09-23T10:57:06  <XRayCulver> if you can save the state after the repeated steps are done and re-use them between tests, that would just speed up the test and have a one point of change for those steps
2011-09-23T10:57:17  <XRayCulver> and that state setup/load is seperate from the test itself
2011-09-23T10:58:13  <XRayCulver> let me know if you use what barancev suggested

2011-09-23T12:26:34  <barancev> yes, and in chrome too
2011-09-23T12:27:25  <jarib> so what makes you think it's a problem with bot.dom.isTextual/isEditable?
2011-09-23T12:27:54  <jarib> (since both firefox and chrome run the same code)
2011-09-23T12:29:40  <barancev> it was a guess...

2011-09-23T12:41:05  <jarib> algard: may also need to set XRE_CONSOLE_LOG as an environment variable to get non-webdriver stuff logged
2011-09-23T12:41:24  <krosenvold> them how can we test all sorts of grid/node failures ??
2011-09-23T12:41:40  <jarib> algard: that should be setPreference("webdriver.log.file", "/path/to/file") of course
2011-09-23T12:42:00  <nirvdrum> The same way we do it for Selenium Server.  Manually . . .
2011-09-23T12:42:07  <nirvdrum> But that's obviously not working well for us.
2011-09-23T12:42:46  <nirvdrum> I'm also not crazy about the old version of Jetty we've vendored.

2011-09-23T12:46:01  <nirvdrum> I just came across some JSON schema libs that could probably be used to validate the responses without needing a proxy.
2011-09-23T12:46:29  <krosenvold> I'm thinking something like a browser *unreliable that could have all sort of parameters
2011-09-23T12:46:53  <krosenvold> desiredCapabilities=hangOn:get
2011-09-23T12:47:10  <nirvdrum> Ahh.  capybara-webkit uses a headless webkit to drive tests.  It's better than HtmlUnit because you get a real JS engine.
2011-09-23T12:47:19  <nirvdrum> We could probably cobble something together like that.
2011-09-23T12:47:52  <krosenvold> I'm thinking it would be best if it was a "real" browser that could be used in all sorts of settings

2011-09-23T13:09:12  *** cburroughs has quit IRC
2011-09-23T13:09:41  <barancev> yes, I've managed with IEDriver.dll
2011-09-23T13:10:10  <barancev> and my guess was right -- bot.dom.isEditable(element) returns false for IE and that results in throw new bot.Error(bot.ErrorCode.INVALID_ELEMENT_STATE,
2011-09-23T13:10:32  *** mltolun has quit IRC
2011-09-23T13:10:46  <barancev> IE thinks file inout is not editable, other drivers think it is
2011-09-23T13:10:51  <jimevans> i should've predicted that. IE paints file elements as disabled.
2011-09-23T13:11:09  <jimevans> the text-box portion of them anyway.
2011-09-23T13:11:30  <barancev> chrome does not show text-box at all

2011-09-23T13:13:19  <barancev> well, we are here: bot.action.type sends keys to any element that isShown
2011-09-23T13:13:40  <barancev> but clear wants it to be editable that is tricky to define
2011-09-23T13:14:10  <barancev> does clear correspond to any user action?
2011-09-23T13:14:22  <barancev> especially for file input field?
2011-09-23T13:14:42  <barancev> can I manually clear such a field?
2011-09-23T13:14:50  <jimevans> for file inputs, i have no idea how you'd clear it manually in ie.
2011-09-23T13:15:15  <barancev> neither in other browsers
2011-09-23T13:16:28  <barancev> may be #2370 deserves "won't fix"?

2011-09-23T13:17:03  <jimevans> i'd be perfectly fine with that, particularly since it's unclear how the user would do so manually.
2011-09-23T13:17:43  <jimevans> right. gotta go.
