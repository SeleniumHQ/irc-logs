2011-10-07T03:33:51  <dawagner> Also, isn't the hamcrest inantely tied to junit?
2011-10-07T03:34:12  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-10-07T03:35:59  <Ajay> commons lang to 3.0.1
2011-10-07T03:36:16  <dawagner> Isn't that a huge breaking change?
2011-10-07T03:37:01  <dawagner> Why do we actually depend on commons lang? Do we use it in source? Do dependencies depend on it transitively? Both?
2011-10-07T03:37:49  <Ajay> yeah , thats y i didnt think about the jetty jars

2011-10-07T03:49:38  <dawagner> Ajay: Do we have transitive dependencies on commons-lang?
2011-10-07T03:50:26  <Fry33> Hello all, I'm trying to verify tip-text, which appears on mouse over event, so I wrote the following code: this.getActions().moveToElement( el, 1, 1 ).perform(); but text quikly disappeas. is there any way to increase time when mouse over the element?
2011-10-07T03:52:14  <Ajay> dawagner: i am not sure , i need to dig in
2011-10-07T03:54:19  <Ajay> Does anybody know easy mechanism to find the dependencies across jars
2011-10-07T03:54:26  <Fry33> As I know this.getWebDriver().manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait( 30,
2011-10-07T03:54:26  <Fry33>  TimeUnit.SECONDS ); should incerase time for tip showin, but it doesn't ^(
2011-10-07T03:54:39  <dawagner> Ajay: You're a maven user, right?
2011-10-07T03:56:33  <dawagner> mvn dependency:tree will probably help you out
2011-10-07T03:56:34  <Ajay> dawagner: yeah
2011-10-07T03:56:43  <Ajay> i was doing the same
2011-10-07T03:57:37  <dawagner> Looks like htmlunit uses it directly
2011-10-07T03:57:55  <dawagner> We use it directly in one place, where we don't need to
2011-10-07T03:58:36  <dawagner> I wouldn't bother updating until htmlunit do
2011-10-07T03:58:46  <dawagner> It will only be painful
2011-10-07T03:59:09  <dawagner> s/It will only be painful/It won't do anything, but we'll have to keep 2.6 on the classpath, because they changed their package names in 3/

2011-10-07T04:04:52  <dawagner> I think because we don't actually use commons-lang, updating it won't gain us anything, and we really should wait for HtmlUnit to want it

2011-10-07T05:25:20  <papegaaij> dawagner: is the webdriver thread safe?
2011-10-07T05:26:09  <papegaaij> this is the problem we are facing: some of our pages show an alert when you try to navigate away from them
2011-10-07T05:26:29  <papegaaij> our testcase is generic, so it does not know much about the page, and cannot predict when this alert is shown
2011-10-07T05:26:53  <papegaaij> so we test for the alert, and if one is shown, we click ok
2011-10-07T05:27:27  <papegaaij> these alerts block clicked links, so we either have to wait for the next page or for the alert
2011-10-07T05:27:53  <papegaaij> so if we could wait for both of them at the same time, the 2 second delay wouldn't be a problem anymore

2011-10-07T06:12:17  <davehunt> update it? does it need updating?
2011-10-07T06:12:40  <davehunt> I have to admit it's not my extension, I just wrapped an existing extension as a plugin
2011-10-07T06:13:05  <Ajay> i think max version needs a bump , current not for FF7
2011-10-07T06:14:07  <jarib> davehunt: it's not dead, i just don't have the login details for the VM, so can't start the agent

2011-10-07T06:14:37  <Ajay> dawagner: thanks for the tests , i will start looking into it this weekend
2011-10-07T06:14:44  <adamgoucher> which what?
2011-10-07T06:14:50  <davehunt> Ajay: Should be compatible... no need to update the max version. Let me check
2011-10-07T06:14:54  <jarib> adamgoucher: OS X VM/agent on bamboo
2011-10-07T06:14:57  * adamgoucher hasnt caffienated yet but the icon is bouncing
2011-10-07T06:15:10  <jarib> i don't have the login
2011-10-07T06:15:11  <adamgoucher> ah. that i can do
2011-10-07T06:17:35  <Ajay> davehunt: i tried installing , its not compatible  with FF 7.0.1
2011-10-07T06:18:05  <davehunt> Ajay: updating it on AMO now
2011-10-07T06:18:48  <davehunt> done
2011-10-07T06:19:03  <Ajay> davehunt:That was faster , Thanks :)
2011-10-07T06:19:17  <davehunt> It's pretty quick/easy to do in AMO
2011-10-07T06:19:31  <adamgoucher> looks like the osx agent should be up in a minute or so
2011-10-07T06:20:10  <davehunt> Thanks adamgoucher
2011-10-07T06:20:35  <jarib> adamgoucher: btw, i disabled the vagrant/virtualbox builds, since the xserve keeps crashing when i run them
2011-10-07T06:20:49  <jarib> it may be the RAM, or it may be a virtualbox bug
2011-10-07T06:20:51  <jarib> or a combination
2011-10-07T06:21:06  <jarib> will try again when the new RAM is in place
2011-10-07T06:22:46  <ace_me> I've tried if document.getElementById('myid') and next line type id=myid and endif
2011-10-07T06:22:49  <ace_me> without success
2011-10-07T06:22:51  <adamgoucher> at least the 'hard' stuff is done
2011-10-07T06:23:29  <jarib> the puppet stuff will be useful anyway

2011-10-07T06:37:23  <Adamantus> I'm trying to find out how to use Selenium to test scripts across multiple browsers and platforms. Does anyone know the best way of doing this?
2011-10-07T06:37:40  <Adamantus> We tried crossbrowsertesting.com but they don't seem to do Selenium
2011-10-07T06:38:24  <Adamantus> We need to be able to run the same script in ie9, FF, Safari, on Windows, Linux, Apple etc.

2011-10-07T06:49:50  <mltolun> All, how does the JsonWireProtocol works? Does it add lots of load to the Hudson server?
2011-10-07T06:49:52  <AutomatedTester> jarib: it has wifi, closer to the train station
2011-10-07T06:50:14  <AutomatedTester> closer to google campus and near-ish the google apartments where dawagner  and Simon are staying
2011-10-07T06:50:57  <AutomatedTester> jarib: we can easily walk to the apartments and get them there
2011-10-07T06:51:57  <jarib> sounds good

2011-10-07T06:58:44  <mltolun> AutomatedTester, do you know if JsonWireProtocol add lots of load to the (CI) server which is executing?
2011-10-07T06:59:02  <AutomatedTester> mltolun: I would be very surprised if it did
2011-10-07T07:00:11  <mltolun> when executing a UT, it sends all the logic to the Grid? Or goes back and fwd for every command?
2011-10-07T07:01:12  <AutomatedTester> mltolun: unless you are running a machine with less than 512MB RAM and a chipset that is over 5 years ago I would be surprised by it adding a lot of load
2011-10-07T07:01:36  <AutomatedTester> but I am assuming the browsers are not on your machine, but thats not JSON Wire protocol

2011-10-07T07:02:02  <mltolun> my architecture is like this... Hudson in a local network executing TestNG

2011-10-07T07:02:19  <hajile> seriously, no one has seen this error: 08:13:49.339 ERROR - Failed to start new browser session, shutdown browser and clear all session data

2011-10-07T07:03:15  <mltolun> So Hudson executes, let's say 200 UTs, in parallel, in batchs of 20. Sending these to the Grid outside our local network.
2011-10-07T07:03:24  <mltolun> Then the Grid, in the cloud, hits our site.
2011-10-07T07:05:35  <mltolun> AutomatedTester, my concern is about that communication betweem Hudson and the Grid on the cloud.

2011-10-07T07:22:15  <AutomatedTester> mltolun: each command will incur some bandwidth

2011-10-07T07:22:56  <jarib> mltolun: what to execute may very well depend on the result of the previous command
2011-10-07T07:23:01  <jarib> so you can't just send a list of commands
2011-10-07T07:23:41  <mltolun> AutomatedTester, jarib, got it
2011-10-07T07:24:00  <mltolun> However, I may need maven to zip all the units...send them to the Grid machine
2011-10-07T07:24:05  <mltolun> and execute another maven there

2011-10-07T07:27:14  <jimevans> jarib: watir-webdriver question... does browser.close() call WebDriver.quit()?
2011-10-07T07:27:43  <jarib> yes
2011-10-07T07:27:48  <jimevans> thanks.
2011-10-07T07:28:20  <jarib> you can do browser.window.close though
2011-10-07T07:28:48  <jarib> (though only in watir-webdriver)
2011-10-07T07:29:05  <jimevans> i'm translating a watir-webdriver script back into vanilla webdriver code, and the watir-webdriver code does browser.close
2011-10-07T07:29:12  <jarib> right
2011-10-07T07:29:21  <jimevans> wanted to make sure i got the translation right.

2011-10-07T07:49:18  <ChrisCulver> findelements().first(e => e.getAttribute("aria-labelledby") == "value");
2011-10-07T07:49:46  <ChrisCulver> equivilent to xpath.contains() i think

2011-10-07T08:07:49  <NizzeH> Hi! I am using WebDriver 2.7.0 on c#. I have a button that is only visible when I hove over an element. I want to click on that button using webdriver. So I need to figure out a way to hover the element first and then click on the button. Is there any way to do that?
2011-10-07T08:08:13  <jimevans> NizzeH: use the Actions class, specifically the MoveToElement() method.
2011-10-07T08:08:37  <jimevans> Actions is in the OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions namespace.
2011-10-07T08:08:56  <ChrisCulver> jimevans: for ie would you recommend .Find("//div[@aria-labelledby='ui-dialog-title-current-division-popup']"); or .Find("div[aria-labelledby='ui-dialog-title-current-division-popup']");
2011-10-07T08:09:01  <ChrisCulver> xpath vs css
2011-10-07T08:09:16  <jimevans> css would likely be faster on IE.

2011-10-07T10:17:42  <lukeis> lord1234: how is row_values initialized... looks like it's just a reference, you need to initialize it new inside the loop

2011-10-07T10:32:51  <lord1234> is there a way to reference sub elements of an element?  like for example I have a css element identifyed by "<div id="_row0" class="odd nowrap clear">"  and it has a child tag of <div class="selection_div">  is there a way to reference that child div without doing a new find_element call?

2011-10-07T12:30:51  <bubba42> Hi I'm trying to return the value of a javascript string to selenium (java) -- say the value of my javascript element is ele.textContent -- how do I get it back to my java driver ?
2011-10-07T12:32:47  <lukeis> bubba42:  String value = (String) ((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("return arguments[0].textContent", element);
2011-10-07T12:33:29  <lukeis> ^ element being a WebElement ... or you can do it without passing element and doing just straight JS
2011-10-07T12:33:41  <bubba42> thx let me try that
2011-10-07T12:34:10  <bubba42> I was trying
2011-10-07T12:34:11  <bubba42> 		String ele=selenium.getEval("var ele = document.evaluate(\"id('page-container/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]')\", document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE,null); " +
2011-10-07T12:34:11  <bubba42> 				"ele.iterateNext();" +
2011-10-07T12:34:11  <bubba42> 				"ele.textContent;");
2011-10-07T12:34:37  <lukeis> that's selenium, you using RC or WebDriver?
2011-10-07T12:35:02  <lukeis> you said java driver, so i assumed webdriver....
2011-10-07T12:35:06  <bubba42> i c
2011-10-07T12:35:17  <bubba42> I'm not sure what the diff is -- sorry I'm new :-(
2011-10-07T12:35:33  <lukeis> Selenium selenium;  is RC
2011-10-07T12:35:46  <lukeis> WebDriver driver; is well... WebDriver ;)
2011-10-07T12:35:50  <bubba42> am I using an antiquated
2011-10-07T12:35:55  <bubba42> method ?
2011-10-07T12:36:01  <lukeis> no, not really
2011-10-07T12:36:18  <lukeis> but if you're new it would be better to use the WebDriver interface than the RC (Selenium) one
2011-10-07T12:38:08  <lukeis> and I'm now looking at what you pasted.... you trying to use xpath?
2011-10-07T12:38:28  <lukeis> i doubt your id is really "page-container/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]"
2011-10-07T12:38:30  <bubba42> yes
2011-10-07T12:38:46  <bubba42> ah yuk
2011-10-07T12:38:51  <bubba42> i c the bug
2011-10-07T12:40:44  <lukeis> and btw that is an extremely brittle locator... any classes or other things you can use to locate that element?
2011-10-07T12:43:17  <bubba42> ya .. I'm just experimenting at this stage
2011-10-07T12:43:35  <bubba42> trying to figure out how to understand best practices
2011-10-07T12:43:44  <bubba42> like what can I get out of SE and what needs to be javascript
2011-10-07T12:43:49  <lukeis> ok... first try switching to WebDriver ;)
2011-10-07T12:44:15  <lukeis> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html
2011-10-07T12:45:16  <bubba42> will do
2011-10-07T12:45:39  <bubba42> is it a cleaner api ?
2011-10-07T12:45:41  <lukeis> i'm doing a lot less javascript things now than i was with RC
2011-10-07T12:45:44  <lukeis> yes :)
2011-10-07T12:46:53  <bubba42> i c cool
2011-10-07T12:47:00  <bubba42> so back to my existing code
2011-10-07T12:47:00  <bubba42> 		String ele=selenium.getEval("var ele = document.evaluate(\"id('page-container')/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]\", document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE,null); " +
2011-10-07T12:47:01  <bubba42> 				"ele.iterateNext();" +
2011-10-07T12:47:01  <bubba42> 				"ele.textContent;");
2011-10-07T12:47:01  <lukeis> basically what you are trying to do in WebDriver translates to:   driver.findElement(By.xpath("id('page-container')/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]").getText()
2011-10-07T12:47:09  <bubba42> ya I'll try that
2011-10-07T12:47:14  <lord1234> holy jeezus
2011-10-07T12:47:18  <lord1234> yea that sucks bubba42
2011-10-07T12:47:32  <bubba42> I'm just packing up to go work out  -- so before I go :-) -- can u help me hey this test through
2011-10-07T12:47:34  <bubba42> 		String ele=selenium.getEval("var ele = document.evaluate(\"id('page-container')/div/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[3]\", document, null, XPathResult.ANY_TYPE,null); " +
2011-10-07T12:47:34  <bubba42> 				"ele.iterateNext();" +
2011-10-07T12:47:34  <bubba42> 				"ele.textContent;");
2011-10-07T12:47:44  <bubba42> and then I'm trying to do a System.out.println(ele)
2011-10-07T12:47:48  <bubba42> just for kicks
2011-10-07T12:47:53  <lukeis> i can't test it without a web page to point at
2011-10-07T12:47:55  <bubba42> I'm still getting a null
2011-10-07T12:48:16  <bubba42> that's cool but is the sequence of steps correct
2011-10-07T12:48:27  <bubba42> is that how one gets a string out of js in rc?
2011-10-07T12:48:37  <bubba42> essentially the last line
2011-10-07T12:48:37  <lukeis> hmm... trying to remember rc methods, if there's a better way to do that
2011-10-07T12:48:37  <bubba42>       "ele.textContent;");
2011-10-07T12:48:45  <lukeis> oh
2011-10-07T12:49:01  <lukeis> document needs to be this.browserBot.currentWindow.document

2011-10-07T14:28:12  <XRayCulver> but i'm out for the day
2011-10-07T14:28:15  <XRayCulver> i'll check more next week
2011-10-07T14:28:50  <lukeis> k, alerts are apart of the tests last time i checked and they passed before releasing
2011-10-07T14:28:53  <Renacor> lukeis: the jsonwire equivalent is POST to window right?
2011-10-07T14:29:12  <lukeis> oh, i'd have to check on that
2011-10-07T14:30:16  <lukeis> switchToWindow
2011-10-07T14:30:24  <lukeis> Renacor: ^
2011-10-07T14:31:12  <Renacor> lukeis: I am using http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/window but it is not focusing
2011-10-07T14:31:27  <Renacor> i.e. firefox starts up but it does not have focus
2011-10-07T14:32:11  <lukeis> java and python use /switchToWindow
2011-10-07T14:32:14  <lukeis> looks to be undocumented
2011-10-07T14:34:03  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-10-07T14:34:20  <Renacor> but it's a jsonwire method?
2011-10-07T14:34:51  <lukeis> yeah
2011-10-07T14:35:35  <lukeis> what are you using the jsonwire for directly? (if you don't mind me asking)
2011-10-07T14:36:32  <Renacor> lukeis: no, using the chibimagic php lib
2011-10-07T14:36:53  <lukeis> ahh... you look at the facebook one?
2011-10-07T14:37:05  <Renacor> looks like switchToWindow is implemented through window in client/src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/HttpCommandExecutor.java
2011-10-07T14:37:12  <Renacor> lukeis: yeah not a fan of that one
2011-10-07T14:39:13  <Renacor> yeah looks like the server is executing switchToWIndow but it's not actually focusing the firefox window
2011-10-07T14:39:16  <lukeis> you are correct... i needed to look one level deeper ;)
2011-10-07T14:39:16  <Renacor> osx

2011-10-07T14:39:33  <lukeis> oh, it doesn't focus the window
2011-10-07T14:39:52  <Renacor> yeah, no exceptions it just does not focus
2011-10-07T14:40:08  <lukeis> i think chrome focuses, not ff... that's normal behaviour
2011-10-07T14:40:24  <Renacor> dang
2011-10-07T14:40:28  <Renacor> how do I start chrome?
2011-10-07T14:40:30  <lukeis> if you need ff to focus, you need to issue some javascript
2011-10-07T14:40:43  <Renacor> how do you focus with js?
2011-10-07T14:40:50  <lukeis> window.focus() ?
2011-10-07T14:40:53  <lukeis> i think
2011-10-07T14:41:01  <Renacor> i see, lemme try that
2011-10-07T14:44:45  *** ash_ has quit IRC
2011-10-07T14:45:52  *** stackedsax has joined #selenium
2011-10-07T14:48:30  <Renacor> k so u gotta enable some security goodness for window.focus() to work
2011-10-07T14:49:17  <lukeis> Renacor: if you want to use chrome, change $this->driver = WebDriver_Driver::InitAtLocal("4444", "firefox");   to $this->driver = WebDriver_Driver::InitAtLocal("4444", "chrome");
2011-10-07T14:49:40  <Renacor> lukeis: tried that, doesn't seem to work
2011-10-07T14:49:51  <lukeis> and make sure you download (and put on the system path) chromedriver (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/downloads/list
2011-10-07T14:49:54  <Renacor> i see
2011-10-07T14:50:35  <lukeis> works best if you update the version of chrome to the dev channel too
2011-10-07T14:51:00  <Renacor> dom.disable_window_flip
2011-10-07T14:51:22  <Renacor> i wonder if I enable that if it would let the webdriver window focusing work as well
2011-10-07T14:51:30  <Renacor> need to try this out

2011-10-07T15:07:51  *** r4m has joined #selenium
2011-10-07T15:08:11  <lukeis> any reason you need focus?

2011-10-07T15:09:44  *** DustinFay has quit IRC
2011-10-07T15:10:04  <Renacor> lukeis: yeah it's for a typeahead field test
2011-10-07T15:10:16  <Renacor> lukeis: if the window is not focused the results won't show up
2011-10-07T15:11:41  <lukeis> can you locate the element and focus it?  I don't know if php allows you to pass a webelement as an argument to javascript, but   executeScript("arguments[0].focus()", $element);  ?
2011-10-07T15:11:58  <lukeis> sorry... don't use php bindings
2011-10-07T15:12:29  <Renacor> lukeis: i don't think its a php problem
2011-10-07T15:12:32  <lukeis> athought that should happen with send keys
2011-10-07T15:12:41  <lukeis> is it using flash?
2011-10-07T15:12:51  <lukeis> why does the page "need" focus?
2011-10-07T15:12:55  <Renacor> lukeis: I do try to focus the element through webdriver clicking it and whatnot and that does not work either
2011-10-07T15:12:58  <Renacor> no flash
2011-10-07T15:13:35  <lukeis> ah, yeah, that won't work... if you really need the window, it's just window.focus
2011-10-07T15:13:42  <lukeis> downgrade firefox? :)
2011-10-07T15:14:27  <lukeis> so, i still don't see a reason yet with your page why it needs focus
2011-10-07T15:15:14  <Renacor> lukeis: not sure what it is but the field won't work if the browser is not focused
2011-10-07T15:15:48  <lukeis> can you get the UI dev's to fix that?
2011-10-07T15:18:35  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-10-07T15:20:02  <Renacor> not sure
2011-10-07T15:22:15  <Renacor> strange, when I run window.focus() from a firebug window it focuses but not when I run js from selenium
2011-10-07T15:22:20  <Renacor> what could cause that
2011-10-07T15:27:57  *** ArmEagle has quit IRC
2011-10-07T15:28:26  *** cgoldberg has quit IRC
2011-10-07T15:29:01  <Renacor> ugh i give up on this
2011-10-07T15:29:07  <Renacor> how do you use this chromedriver?
2011-10-07T15:30:54  *** Ajay has quit IRC
2011-10-07T15:31:00  *** ArmEagle has joined #selenium
2011-10-07T15:33:11  <stackedsax> I don't know if I reported this yet, but setting the value for timeout in the json conf file for the RC seems to cause the Rc not to timeout like normal
2011-10-07T15:33:58  <stackedsax> when we removed the timeout value, browsers that were left open would get cleared off like they should
2011-10-07T15:34:31  <lukeis> stackedsax: did you create an issue?
2011-10-07T15:34:48  <lukeis> Renacor: how can i help ya get started with chromedriver
2011-10-07T15:35:26  <Renacor> lukeis: i don't think I fully understand how this works, seems like the chromedriver I am running is a server that runs on port 9515
2011-10-07T15:35:42  <Renacor> do I connect my client to that instead of selenium server on port 4444 ?
2011-10-07T15:35:51  <lukeis> yeah, so you'll have to change it to that port from 4444
2011-10-07T15:35:58  <Renacor> and no wd/hub ?
2011-10-07T15:35:59  <lukeis> yep
2011-10-07T15:36:02  <lukeis> yep
2011-10-07T15:36:14  <Renacor> dang need to rewrite this lib a bit then
2011-10-07T15:36:20  <Renacor> anything else different?
2011-10-07T15:36:33  <lukeis> oh
2011-10-07T15:36:44  <lukeis> wait you can still use the selenium server on 4444
2011-10-07T15:36:51  <lukeis> you don't have to start chromedriver yourself
2011-10-07T15:37:04  <lukeis> the standalone server will do it
2011-10-07T15:37:13  <lukeis> as long as chromedriver lives on the system path
2011-10-07T15:39:53  <Renacor> so I can still use selenium server transparently?
2011-10-07T15:40:33  <lukeis> yes
2011-10-07T15:41:26  <Renacor> k lemme try that
2011-10-07T15:41:27  <lukeis> just make sure you call "quit" at the end of your tests... otherwise you'll have a bunch of left over chromedriver processes laying around
2011-10-07T15:44:04  <Renacor> getting an exception
2011-10-07T15:44:21  <stackedsax> lukeis: I did not create one yet — last time I did it was suggested that I raise the issue in the IRC first
2011-10-07T15:44:30  <stackedsax> but I'd be happy to write it up
2011-10-07T15:44:46  <Renacor> lukeis: https://gist.github.com/1271541 <-- am I missing something?
2011-10-07T15:44:53  <lukeis> stackedsax: if you have a reproducible test case that you can provide, you can write it up
2011-10-07T15:45:23  <lukeis> browsername should be chrome not *chrome
2011-10-07T15:45:30  <Renacor> oh
2011-10-07T15:45:58  <stackedsax> sure thing
2011-10-07T15:46:16  <Renacor> beautiful that works!
2011-10-07T15:46:22  <Renacor> just need to pass some command line options
2011-10-07T15:46:50  <stackedsax> I'd also like to write up the one I aired yesterday about the grid defaulting to webdriver if both webdriver and rc RC's are using the same browser name
2011-10-07T15:46:50  <lukeis> you know how to do that?
2011-10-07T15:47:48  <lukeis> stackedsax: as long as you have all information for someone to completely reproduce your scenario, then go for it
2011-10-07T15:48:10  <lukeis> s/you have/you provide/
2011-10-07T15:48:34  <lukeis> Renacor: you know how to provide --chome-switches? :)
2011-10-07T15:48:59  <Renacor> lukeis: trying chrome --optionname but that doesn't seem to work =P

2011-10-07T15:50:12  <Renacor> lukeis: yeah reading that, thank you
2011-10-07T15:50:58  <lukeis> the array that is passed on startup needs ->   { "browserName": "chrome", "chrome.switches":["--some-switch","--another-one"]}
2011-10-07T15:51:10  <lukeis> it has to be a list, even if you are only passing in one switch
2011-10-07T15:56:18  <Renacor> lukeis: thanks man you have been EXTREMELY helpful
2011-10-07T15:56:36  <lukeis> anytime I have time! :)
