2011-05-12T06:44:42  <AutomatedTester> rc1 to be released in the next couple weeks?
2011-05-12T06:44:54  <AutomatedTester> sound right? jimevans, jarib ?
2011-05-12T06:45:14  <jimevans> sometime in there, i think.
2011-05-12T06:45:21  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-05-12T06:46:11  <jimevans> aside from wanting to deprecate the "fluent" interface for IWebDriver (.Manage(), .SwitchTo(), etc.), .NET is pretty much ready, I think.
2011-05-12T06:46:44  <jimevans> implemented the android driver yesterdayl.
2011-05-12T06:46:55  <jimevans> s/yesterdayl/yesterday/
2011-05-12T06:47:47  <jarib> why do you want to deprecate it?
2011-05-12T06:48:14  <jarib> not idiomatic?
2011-05-12T06:48:32  <jimevans> it's not idiomatic of .net. plus in the standardization effort, i would discourage fluent interfaces.
2011-05-12T06:50:51  <jimevans> in the current proposed idl, it's not really consistent with having returning an attribute named "manage"
2011-05-12T06:51:02  <jimevans> s/having returning/having
2011-05-12T06:51:12  <jimevans> (damn headache)
2011-05-12T06:53:00  <jimevans> i feel strongly that interface names and attribute names should be nouns. methods should be verbs.

2011-05-12T07:20:40  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-05-12T07:22:33  <bcave> i don't think that my selenium test case is working as expected. if I use setSpeed() on a selenium object (WebDriverBackedSelenium), shouldnt there be a delay between steps?\
2011-05-12T07:23:12  <bcave> e.g. selenium.setSpeed("3000"); selenium.click("link"); selenium.click("other_link");
2011-05-12T07:23:36  <bcave> should that have a 3s delay between opening the page (if i start with a selenium.open("/") ) and clicking of links ?
2011-05-12T07:29:08  <jimevans> ato: did you ever get the chance to look for the .proto file for ums?
2011-05-12T07:29:40  <ato> Ah, yes.  Stuk had a look for it, but couldn't find it.  I'll have another look.
2011-05-12T07:30:40  <jimevans> thanks.
2011-05-12T07:36:42  <barancev> what's status of RenderedWebElement? in what version it will be removed from distribution?
2011-05-12T07:36:57  *** esteele is now known as esteele|away
2011-05-12T07:37:44  <jimevans> barancev: that may be slightly dependent on the individual language binding, but for .NET, it's being deprecated in the next release, for removal the release after that.
2011-05-12T07:39:29  <barancev> jimevans: in Java binding it is already deprecated in all beta versions, and may be RC1 is a good day to kick it off?
2011-05-12T07:40:46  <jimevans> i'm no java expert, so i don't know what simonstewart's plans are for exactly when it's to be removed
2011-05-12T07:41:02  <barancev> is opera driver is going to be in RC1?
2011-05-12T07:41:39  <ato> I couldn't possibly comment!
2011-05-12T07:41:49  <ato> (Also known as, I have no idea.)
2011-05-12T07:42:53  <ato> Everything is ready for OperaDriver to go into the Selenium tree, but I think simon might want us to pass all the unit tests first.

2011-05-12T07:55:56  <AutomatedTester> ato: that mean you have JSON Wire support
2011-05-12T07:56:04  <AutomatedTester> or is it still protobuf?
2011-05-12T07:56:20  <ato> We use protobuf between the driver and Opera.

2011-05-12T07:56:55  <ato> The regular remote wire seems to work alright with OperaDriver as well.
2011-05-12T07:57:00  <ato> Yep.
2011-05-12T07:57:13  <AutomatedTester> nice
2011-05-12T07:57:15  <ato> Just expose OperaDriver on your class path, and you should be set to go.
2011-05-12T07:57:31  <ato> I got it working with selenium-webdriver.
2011-05-12T07:57:43  <ato> Which reminds me.  I should submit patches to jarib.

2011-05-12T12:37:19  <lord1234> can anyone help me with the following
2011-05-12T12:37:20  <lord1234> http://www.pastie.org/1894302
2011-05-12T12:37:26  <lord1234> i pasted the error msg and the function text
2011-05-12T12:39:29  <barancev> lord1234: would you show the code where WaitForPage was called from?
2011-05-12T12:39:52  *** andytinkham has joined #selenium
2011-05-12T12:39:57  <barancev> it seems that there were no need to wait foê page to load
2011-05-12T12:39:58  <lord1234> its jsut a call to Waitforpage()
2011-05-12T12:40:04  <lord1234> oh not
2011-05-12T12:40:07  <lord1234> there was a need for sure
2011-05-12T12:40:30  <lord1234> and even if there wasn't it shoudl have just kept going right?
2011-05-12T12:41:13  <barancev> there were no "page loaded" event in 30 sec, and selenium told you about that
2011-05-12T12:41:25  <lord1234> the issue is
2011-05-12T12:41:29  <lord1234> that sometimes it takes time to load
2011-05-12T12:41:31  <lord1234> sometimes it doesn't
2011-05-12T12:41:36  <lord1234> i can't control how slow our DB is
2011-05-12T12:42:02  <barancev> what was before the call to WaitForPage?
2011-05-12T12:42:30  <lord1234> oen sec
2011-05-12T12:42:50  <lord1234> $browser.click("//html/body/div[1]/div[5]/table/tbody/tr[" + i.to_s + "]/td[6]/a")             $BTBrowse.WaitForPage()
2011-05-12T12:42:53  <lord1234> it clicked a link.
2011-05-12T12:43:32  <barancev> huh, yes, wait is needed
2011-05-12T12:43:44  <barancev> and may be 30 sec is not enough?
2011-05-12T12:43:47  <lord1234> oh no
2011-05-12T12:43:50  <lord1234> the page definitely loaded
2011-05-12T12:43:57  <lord1234> i'm not worried about 30 secs not being enough
2011-05-12T12:44:05  <lord1234> what I am worried about is that display of the cmd and sessionID
2011-05-12T12:44:21  <lord1234> i just want the error msg about  Timed out, waiting a bit longer
2011-05-12T12:45:06  <lord1234> cuz it makes log output spammy
2011-05-12T12:45:51  <barancev> try to wait for an element to appear on thó page
2011-05-12T12:46:17  <barancev> looks like ajax is here
2011-05-12T12:46:42  <barancev> in that case page is not reloaded, only parts of the page are
2011-05-12T12:46:44  *** mashiara has joined #selenium
2011-05-12T12:47:18  <barancev> and "page loaded" event does not happen
2011-05-12T12:48:23  <lord1234> there is ajax
2011-05-12T12:48:26  <lord1234> but there is plenty of htmla nd such
2011-05-12T12:49:00  <barancev> no matter. is the page is not completely reloaded, there is no "page loaded" event
2011-05-12T12:49:26  <barancev> and you have to find some other thing to wait for

2011-05-12T12:49:37  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-05-12T12:49:40  <barancev> e.g. waiting for an element to appear
2011-05-12T12:50:12  <barancev> an element that shows error message
2011-05-12T12:50:27  <lord1234> but is there a way to just not show that sessionID and such?
2011-05-12T12:50:29  <lord1234> no way to hide that?
2011-05-12T12:53:16  <barancev> if you just want to wait for 30 sec -- use sleep :)
2011-05-12T12:53:33  <lord1234> sometmies it does it in 3 seconds
2011-05-12T12:53:37  <lord1234> sleeping 30 seconds is a long time
2011-05-12T12:54:56  <barancev> use more robust indication of processing end -- appearance of a success|error message
2011-05-12T12:55:10  <lord1234> there is no appearance of such msg
2011-05-12T12:55:28  <lord1234> page loads
2011-05-12T12:55:29  <lord1234> the end
2011-05-12T12:56:46  <barancev> ok, you mean that your rescue block does not cacth exception? sorry, I'm not a Ruby-man, can't help

2011-05-12T14:38:02  <adamgoucher> irc is even easier than that though
2011-05-12T14:39:06  <ato> What's the right way to submit a patch to the selenium repo, by the way?
2011-05-12T14:39:12  <ato> By diffing and sending to selenium-dev@?

2011-05-12T14:41:32  <ato> Hrm.  That's going to be difficult.
2011-05-12T14:41:41  <ato> Opera is very skeptical towards the CLA.

2011-05-12T14:43:55  <sep_13_track1> Hey anyone know if it's planned to have docs for webdriver python at any point? Haven't touched selenium in a while and just looking for the command to open a url. The only docs on the web say:
2011-05-12T14:44:02  <sep_13_track1> To view all commands available to you inside your python shell, after importing perform:
2011-05-12T14:44:02  <sep_13_track1> dir(webdriver)
2011-05-12T14:44:03  <sep_13_track1> To view the docstrings (documentation text attached to a function or method), perform
2011-05-12T14:44:03  <sep_13_track1> print 'functionname'.__doc__
2011-05-12T14:44:20  <sep_13_track1> kinda ridiculous
2011-05-12T14:45:13  <adamgoucher> i think once the stuff is at sfc you will still need to go through a license thing
2011-05-12T14:45:40  <ato> Yes, but not with Google.
2011-05-12T14:46:30  * ato sighs.
2011-05-12T14:46:33  <ato> I hate this beurocracy.
2011-05-12T14:46:42  <ato> I should probably have another talk with Lars Erk tomorrow.

2011-05-12T14:51:36  <seanh-ansca> anyone know why an "open(url)" call would cause firefox to ask me to save the page?

2011-05-12T14:52:09  <seanh-ansca> php
2011-05-12T14:52:28  <jarib> no idea, sorry
2011-05-12T14:52:53  <seanh-ansca> i would think that the language wouldn't matter
2011-05-12T14:53:03  <seanh-ansca> i'm running it against a grid setup
2011-05-12T14:53:33  <sep_13_track1> seanh-ansca, check the type of content being returned on the page
2011-05-12T14:54:11  <sep_13_track1> if it's a weird mime-type it will ask you to save or ask you what to do
2011-05-12T14:54:20  <seanh-ansca> "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8"
