2011-07-06T01:14:29  <simonstewart> I saw your tweet last night about maybe having a fix for the jvm crasher
2011-07-06T01:14:40  <Binken[A]> (H) I saw jim fixed the IE6 issues :)

2011-07-06T01:15:30  <simonstewart> WTF? A fresh checkout and "./go" no longer works
2011-07-06T01:15:35  <jimevans> I think so. I noticed that the Java bindings load the native code dll every time.
2011-07-06T01:15:41  <simonstewart> Yup
2011-07-06T01:15:57  <simonstewart> which is why I was thinking of borrowing Jason's ChromeDriverService and using something like that
2011-07-06T01:16:18  <jimevans> You should take a quick look at the C# IE driver.
2011-07-06T01:16:40  <jimevans> We load the dll once during a session.
2011-07-06T01:16:48  <simonstewart> Handy
2011-07-06T01:17:09  *** admc has quit IRC
2011-07-06T01:17:28  <simonstewart> Right. That's the sort of thing
2011-07-06T01:18:22  <jimevans> The dll can be loaded without the server running, so there are a couple of APIs that were added to the native code to facilitate getting the state of the server.
2011-07-06T01:18:36  <simonstewart> cool
2011-07-06T01:18:55  <jimevans> You can query if the server is running, how many sessions the server is currently managing, and the port it's listening on if it's running.
2011-07-06T01:19:07  <simonstewart> heh. "./go" is failing on my linux box on an old checkout too, jarib
2011-07-06T01:19:17  <simonstewart> That's really useful
2011-07-06T01:19:27  * simonstewart has a little porting to do

2011-07-06T01:20:37  <jimevans> As a quick-and-dirty fix last night, I made the "lib" variable static and queried for the port. that seemed to work
2011-07-06T01:20:50  <simonstewart> I'll put in something more stable today
2011-07-06T01:20:53  *** AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
2011-07-06T01:20:54  <jimevans> but I don't know if that would break anything else.
2011-07-06T01:20:58  <jimevans> ok
2011-07-06T01:20:59  <samit> Good morning!
2011-07-06T01:21:02  <simonstewart> I'd still like to know what's causing the underlying issue
2011-07-06T01:21:22  <jimevans> oh, i never said.
2011-07-06T01:21:48  <simonstewart> nope :)
2011-07-06T01:22:23  <jimevans> in the dll, the Server instance is global. when you "reload" the dll, you're not really, because it's already loaded.
2011-07-06T01:22:36  <simonstewart> handy
2011-07-06T01:22:47  <simonstewart> Though aren't we loading the dll from a unique location every time?
2011-07-06T01:22:51  <AutomatedTester> hi hi
2011-07-06T01:22:59  <simonstewart> g'day AutomatedTester
2011-07-06T01:23:09  <AutomatedTester> wow people are on early
2011-07-06T01:23:17  <simonstewart> It's 9.30
2011-07-06T01:23:17  <jimevans> well, in the debug case from yesterday, no we weren't.
2011-07-06T01:23:23  <simonstewart> hah!
2011-07-06T01:23:36  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: yes, most people come on from 10:30 /11
2011-07-06T01:23:49  <simonstewart> Fairy nuff
2011-07-06T01:23:53  <simonstewart> Making an effort to cycle in now
2011-07-06T01:23:57  <simonstewart> So getting here early
2011-07-06T01:24:03  <AutomatedTester> cool
2011-07-06T01:24:19  <jimevans> anyway, the server variable is global, and the failure case doesn't call StopServer()
2011-07-06T01:24:27  <eranm> Did anybody encounter ./go misbehaving if rake is preset locally? (exact error can be seen here: http://pastebin.com/XEBcvbYJ)
2011-07-06T01:24:33  <simonstewart> yes
2011-07-06T01:24:43  <samit> simonstewart: Cycling in London!! Kinda dangerous
2011-07-06T01:24:48  <simonstewart> jarib did an update yesterday and I suspect that's the cause
2011-07-06T01:24:51  <jimevans> so the next call to StartServer() returns the pointer to the previously started server.
2011-07-06T01:24:56  <simonstewart> samit: fortune favours the brace
2011-07-06T01:25:01  <simonstewart> Ohhhh...
2011-07-06T01:25:13  * AutomatedTester <3 Google AppEngine. Someone tried to send a lot of traffic my way and it coped without batting an eyelid
2011-07-06T01:25:26  <eranm> Ah, I see.
2011-07-06T01:25:29  <simonstewart> It's running on something very similar to prod
2011-07-06T01:25:30  <samit> simonstewart: I guess you meant brave, but brace is what can happen :-)
2011-07-06T01:25:46  <simonstewart> If you're not building .net stuff you can step back to the old version
2011-07-06T01:25:52  *** Jaggu has joined #selenium
2011-07-06T01:25:53  <jimevans> which, in addition to listening on a different port, is not the Server you're looking for.
2011-07-06T01:25:53  <simonstewart> samit: the brave also.
2011-07-06T01:26:01  <simonstewart> Wonderful
2011-07-06T01:27:02  <jimevans> So, tl;dr version, load the dll once per jvm.
2011-07-06T01:27:26  <simonstewart> Will do
2011-07-06T01:27:28  <jimevans> You can start and shutdown the server as often as you like within that jvm, and use as many sessions as you like, but don't try to reload the dll
2011-07-06T01:27:47  <simonstewart> How on earth did we not stumble on this before?
2011-07-06T01:29:00  <jimevans> my suspicion is that the regular java tests would either have run against same Protected Mode settings, or would have the flakiness cap set.
2011-07-06T01:29:12  <simonstewart> the former
2011-07-06T01:29:24  <jimevans> In which case, they call quit when they need to, and the server gets uninitialized.
2011-07-06T01:29:44  <simonstewart> Handy to know
2011-07-06T01:29:46  <jimevans> that is, StopServer() is called.
2011-07-06T01:29:57  <jimevans> (which nulls out the native code Server pointer).
2011-07-06T01:30:01  <simonstewart> At least we have some poorly behaved test cases that demonstrate what we'd like to see
2011-07-06T01:30:09  <jimevans> yep.
2011-07-06T01:30:11  <jimevans> brb
2011-07-06T01:30:28  <AutomatedTester> is the rule for looking at patches when someone wants to join the team apply to the docs team too?
2011-07-06T01:30:58  <simonstewart> If we're handy out docs commit access, asking Paul should be enough
2011-07-06T01:31:10  <simonstewart> He has a far better grasp of who's been contributing
2011-07-06T01:31:18  <simonstewart> Though I'd like to apply consistent standards
2011-07-06T01:31:24  <AutomatedTester> Paul has asked we give someone access
2011-07-06T01:31:45  <simonstewart> I'll ask to see if there are any examples of the new chap's work
2011-07-06T01:31:47  <jimevans> back
2011-07-06T01:31:52  <simonstewart> that was fast
2011-07-06T01:32:13  <jimevans> The Wife wanted to be awakened at a specific time.
2011-07-06T01:32:34  <jimevans> I was told to bugger off. (it's early here)
2011-07-06T01:32:37  <simonstewart> ah.
2011-07-06T01:32:42  <simonstewart> My The Wife says that too
2011-07-06T01:33:07  <jimevans> so i was the metaphorical "snooze button"
2011-07-06T01:37:13  <simonstewart> Interesting. The ChromeDriverService doesn't have a static field
2011-07-06T01:37:31  <jimevans> Longer term, it probably makes sense to have the IE driver as a separate executable, but I'd like to sync up with the chromedriver guys first.
2011-07-06T01:37:41  <simonstewart> right
2011-07-06T01:39:10  <AutomatedTester> so my question about clicking a disabled element didnt get a definitive answer
2011-07-06T01:39:19  <AutomatedTester> any objections to asking the same question on twitter?
2011-07-06T01:39:34  <simonstewart> go for it
2011-07-06T01:39:39  <simonstewart> Discussion is good
2011-07-06T01:39:52  <jimevans> ChromeDriverService is launching a separate process. It doesn't need to manage only loading the process once.

2011-07-06T01:52:09  <jimevans> hm. i'm having trouble with it on windows, but I'm pretty sure the issues aren't related.
2011-07-06T01:52:20  <jarib> in what way is it not working?
2011-07-06T01:52:24  <simonstewart> jarib: http://pastebin.com/XEBcvbYJ
2011-07-06T01:52:43  <barancev|2> after go clean I see 916MB, not 602MB
2011-07-06T01:52:52  <barancev|2> clean is not clean enough?
2011-07-06T01:52:58  <simonstewart> apparently not
2011-07-06T01:53:10  <jarib> that can't be linux-specific, since it's working on my linux machines
2011-07-06T01:53:26  <jimevans> any ideas? https://gist.github.com/1066873
2011-07-06T01:53:32  <simonstewart> I've ruby 1.8.7
2011-07-06T01:53:36  <simonstewart> on my linux box
2011-07-06T01:54:53  <eranm> jarib: if I move /usr/bin/rake out of the way ./go would work again
2011-07-06T01:55:21  <simonstewart> Didn't we bump ourselves from 1.8 to 1.9 with that jruby update?"
2011-07-06T01:55:23  <simonstewart> site gems?
2011-07-06T01:56:11  <jarib> not really.. jruby supports both with its --1.9 flag, and has so for a while
2011-07-06T01:56:25  <jarib> not sure how they deal with libraries in that situation
2011-07-06T01:57:36  <simonstewart> I have an idea
2011-07-06T01:57:38  <barancev|2> what is in ipch subdir?
2011-07-06T01:57:41  <AutomatedTester> oh dear
2011-07-06T01:58:12  <simonstewart> that fix works for me
2011-07-06T01:58:19  <barancev|2> it is 156M, and it is not under git
2011-07-06T01:58:24  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart less than 20 seconds ago - SimonStewart: tell the jruby scripts to run as 1.9 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12757
2011-07-06T01:58:25  <jimevans> ipch is the new Visual Studio 2010 precompiled headers
2011-07-06T01:58:26  <simonstewart> what's in it?
2011-07-06T01:58:38  <barancev|2> should it be cleaned with go clean?
2011-07-06T01:58:38  <jimevans> it's a working directory used by VS2010.
2011-07-06T01:59:16  <jimevans> I doubt it.
2011-07-06T01:59:17  <jarib> simonstewart: i think --1.9 is considered experimental
2011-07-06T01:59:23  <barancev|2> or, better, can it be located inside build subdir?
2011-07-06T01:59:34  <simonstewart> jarib: didn't know that
2011-07-06T01:59:42  <simonstewart> But I do know that the code is compiling nicely now :)
2011-07-06T01:59:47  <simonstewart> --1.8 perhaps?
2011-07-06T01:59:54  <jimevans> I've no idea how Visual Studio would react to that folder being moved.
2011-07-06T02:00:00  <jimevans> Or even if it can be.
2011-07-06T02:00:16  <simonstewart> --1.8 causes the problem
2011-07-06T02:00:29  <simonstewart> but since it's generated content, you can igonore it
2011-07-06T02:00:44  <AutomatedTester> can Java RemoteWebDriver not handle cookies?

2011-07-06T02:04:40  <Binken_> because of javascript compilation failed

2011-07-06T02:35:02  <freynaud> anyone else is using the iphone driver on simulator and doesn't have the safari url bar section ? I have the web page full screen, and that looks different from what it really look like on ihpone

2011-07-06T02:45:30  <davehunt> freynaud: My guess is that the link he clicked opened in Safari and sent WebDriver to the background

2011-07-06T02:46:48  <simonstewart> I may be persuaded that the selenium emulation is now a little bit tediously slow
2011-07-06T02:48:09  <freynaud> simonstewart: another good reason to more fully to webdriver :)
2011-07-06T02:48:18  <simonstewart> Indeed.

2011-07-06T02:50:40  <jarib> jimevans: what's the problem?
2011-07-06T02:51:05  <jarib> simonstewart: not sure how you used to build the jar earlier, but that's the method i've been using
2011-07-06T02:51:05  <jimevans> hard to say, and it depends on the target I try.
2011-07-06T02:52:02  <jimevans> if I try building ./go //dotnet, it looks like none of the dependencies are calculated.
2011-07-06T02:53:29  <simonstewart> Well, that's impressive: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRWU2DysF30
2011-07-06T02:53:34  <jarib> jimevans: perhaps `go -P` will give some insights
2011-07-06T02:55:47  <AutomatedTester> don't you love looking at code thats all sorts of wrong
2011-07-06T02:56:55  <simonstewart> sometimes
2011-07-06T02:57:08  <simonstewart> sometimes it's better than looking at code that's all kinds of almost right
2011-07-06T02:57:47  <jimevans> jarib: no, not especially.
2011-07-06T02:58:19  <AutomatedTester> not only does the code look awful, it could never have worked
2011-07-06T02:58:47  <simonstewart> I love it when that happens

2011-07-06T03:06:59  <simonstewart> There is in our code
2011-07-06T03:07:08  <simonstewart> Static methods make it hard to run tests in parallel
2011-07-06T03:07:14  <jimevans> ah. i see.
2011-07-06T03:07:14  <dawagner> simonstewart: Shouldn't we be locking on something static?

2011-07-06T03:07:51  <jarib> simonstewart: the -S flag is supposed to search $PATH for executables, but i think they've had a hack to have the packaged executables take precendence. i'm guessing they've regressed in that

2011-07-06T03:40:48  <nirvdrum> Would that have affected the RC launchers?  My reading of the list didn't seem to indicate it would, but I was definitely seeing the JVM go away and had no clue what was going on.
2011-07-06T03:41:51  <simonstewart> The RC stuff has remained unchanged
2011-07-06T03:42:03  <nirvdrum> Hmm. . . maybe unrelated then.
2011-07-06T03:42:06  <simonstewart> It was just the emulation of RC using webdriver that was causing grief
2011-07-06T03:42:12  <freynaud_> simonstewart: the only issue see with grid is the self launcher node not getting the current Platform automatically, but it has too much screw up potential to fix it now

2011-07-06T04:08:19  <jimevans> dammit, i have no idea why calcdeps.py won't see my java installation as 1.6.
2011-07-06T04:09:01  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Total shot in the dark here, but if you install the Java plugin or JRE, it places a java.exe and javaw.exe in %SYSTEM32% IIRC.
2011-07-06T04:09:15  <nirvdrum> And that will take precedence over anything in your %PATH%
2011-07-06T04:09:49  <nirvdrum> Or you need to throw your entries at the start of your %PATH%.
2011-07-06T04:09:58  <nirvdrum> Something like that.  It's been a while for me.

2011-07-06T04:10:21  <jimevans> good point, but if I do a "java -version" from a command prompt, shouldn't it then show me the correct version for whatever java.exe it finds first?
2011-07-06T04:10:41  <simonstewart> You can modify calcdeps.py to tell you which version it finds
2011-07-06T04:10:47  <simonstewart> That might help
2011-07-06T04:11:01  <nirvdrum> jimevans: Yeah.
2011-07-06T04:11:39  <nirvdrum> Completely unrelated, but I think I'm falling in love with scala.  We'll see after I finally write some code in it though.
2011-07-06T04:12:06  <jarib> jimevans: maybe cmd.exe and python's subprocess.Popen has different ways of searching
2011-07-06T04:12:45  <jarib> if nirvdrum is right and cmd.exe will look in %SYSTEM32% *before* %PATH%, i wouldn't expect python to do that
2011-07-06T04:15:21  <jimevans> hah! it appears that somewhere along the line a J2SE 1.5 runtime was installed.

2011-07-06T06:14:27  <simonstewart> Right. So we appear to depend on the directory without a matching rule to download it

2011-07-06T06:15:19  <simonstewart> jarib: what causes the downloads to be kicked off?
2011-07-06T06:17:11  <jarib> simonstewart: it's just a file rule
2011-07-06T06:17:27  <jarib> so someone depends on third_party/gecko-2/win32
2011-07-06T06:18:22  <jarib> and if it's set up in in Rakefile:246-256, that will kick off the download
2011-07-06T06:18:43  <simonstewart> Hmmm...
2011-07-06T06:19:26  <jarib> the simple fix would be to just change rake-tasks/gecko_sdks. to define the same rule for both \ and /
2011-07-06T06:19:49  <jarib> the proper fix would be to find out why it's being called with \ at all

2011-07-06T07:07:54  <jimevans> "A"? What are we talking about?
2011-07-06T07:07:59  <Binken_> Jim, I realize realize when the mouse move off the window. many case will fail?
2011-07-06T07:08:19  <simonstewart> I've gone through the "A" wiki pages and deleted the comments that need deleting
2011-07-06T07:08:25  <jimevans> ah. i see.
2011-07-06T07:08:25  <simonstewart> And made notes about what to improve in the docs
2011-07-06T07:09:07  <jimevans> Binken_: IE is extremely sensitive to the location of the physical mouse cursor.
2011-07-06T07:09:59  <Binken_> Jim, I met some strange issue for IE
2011-07-06T07:10:17  <jimevans> ok
2011-07-06T07:10:58  <Binken_> First, I click one element, IE auto scroll down and click it. But when I click another elment which is covered by logo bar
2011-07-06T07:11:14  <Binken_> there is no actually click action at all
2011-07-06T07:11:32  <Binken_> The logo bar is belong to the master page

2011-07-06T07:15:20  <jimevans> Binken_: Can the user click on the element while it's behind the "logo bar"?

2011-07-06T07:17:10  <Binken_> I just see it scroll down to the elment :)
2011-07-06T07:17:23  <jimevans> As far as IE is concerned, it already has.
2011-07-06T07:17:34  <jimevans> scrolled down, that is.
2011-07-06T07:17:59  <jimevans> We've already told IE to scroll the page so the element is in view.
2011-07-06T07:18:03  <jimevans> We do that before every click.
2011-07-06T07:18:30  <simonstewart> Interesting. someone on the BuildingWebDriver page asked what webdriver is
2011-07-06T07:18:40  <jimevans> If there's an element that the page decides to float over the element that we've scrolled, how do we detect that?
2011-07-06T07:18:49  <jimevans> the browser already thinks the target element is visible.

2011-07-06T08:21:47  <jarib> personally i'll probably always push for webdriver working at a lower level in these cases since i can always build the user-friendliness into watir-webdriver

2011-07-06T09:20:57  <rpk> dev list, I am disappoint.
2011-07-06T09:21:03  <simonstewart> rpk: the developer list heard that developers expect an exception when clicking on disabled elements as that's typically unexpected
2011-07-06T09:21:10  <simonstewart> (if you see what I mean)
2011-07-06T09:21:38  <simonstewart> We're leaving the user interactions "as-is" to allow the more specialised case of "I know it's disabled, click anyway, damnit!"
2011-07-06T09:21:56  <rpk> simonstewart: Yes, but that seems awfully inconsistent with the goal of using Se as a browser automation tool that is equivalent to a user
2011-07-06T09:21:59  <jimevans> rpk: personally, I'm completely indifferent to whether clicking on a disabled element throws or not.
2011-07-06T09:22:39  <rpk> given the changes in setSelected, I assumed people would want to be consistent in emulating a user.  A user doesn't see an exception when clicking a disabled element.
2011-07-06T09:22:43  <jimevans> (speaking as a member of the dev list)

2011-07-06T09:27:28  <jimevans> Sendkeys should still throw on disabled element, right?

2011-07-06T09:48:25  <tunabum> so, what's the current thinking on setting user preferences through the api? Had an email discussion on the user list about setting the language for the browser, I know you guys have worked hard to get the api's stable, but what about having something like driver.manage().setUserPreference("language", "en-us") ?   ~ the end user can do it at any point, not just on startup ;)
2011-07-06T09:48:26  <jimevans> simonstewart: you might leave the prompt ones ignored. you have to enable prompts in ie for those tests to pass.

2011-07-06T11:43:39  <jarib> samit: probably from the @driver.close in the middle of the test?
2011-07-06T11:43:55  <jarib> if that's the last window, it's equivalent to quit()

2011-07-06T12:02:28  <jarib> also, line 84, you can replace "if not" with "unless"
2011-07-06T12:02:43  <samit> line 62 sends "start msg" to the text box
2011-07-06T12:03:25  <jarib> and what does 64-66 do?
2011-07-06T12:03:31  <jarib> ah
2011-07-06T12:03:39  <jarib> maybe i'm misunderstanding assertNotValue
2011-07-06T12:03:49  <jarib> nvm me
2011-07-06T12:04:39  <samit> 62..66 -> clear textbox, send "start msg" to it then assert that text box is not empty
