2011-08-19T02:03:04  <andreashaas> Do you mean the InvalidSelectorException stuff? It was fixed yesterday
2011-08-19T02:03:20  <andreashaas> Good morning
2011-08-19T02:03:50  <AutomatedTester> good morning andreashaas
2011-08-19T02:04:04  <AutomatedTester> i wasnt having a dig at you
2011-08-19T02:04:23  <AutomatedTester> Dounia removed stuff and forgot to do a build before commiting
2011-08-19T02:05:13  <AutomatedTester> i can't build what's in trunk
2011-08-19T02:05:45  <andreashaas> She changed the type of one exception, as far as I know, and thereby some tests did not run anymore. Eran fixed that yesterday. I had the same problem
2011-08-19T02:05:57  <andreashaas> oh
2011-08-19T02:06:03  <andreashaas> so there is something new :(
2011-08-19T02:06:14  <andreashaas> then I will not get the new trunk
2011-08-19T02:06:59  <AutomatedTester> i am fixing it now
2011-08-19T02:07:05  <andreashaas> cool
2011-08-19T02:09:06  <cornelinux> Hi, what is the best way to click a list element? Using id nor xpath seems to work
2011-08-19T02:10:09  <AutomatedTester> cornelinux: a <ul> or <ol> element in the HTML?
2011-08-19T02:10:24  <AutomatedTester> sorry brain is wrong
2011-08-19T02:10:36  <AutomatedTester> <li> or <option> element
2011-08-19T02:11:19  <cornelinux> AutomatedTester:  was checking ol. Anyway it is a <li>
2011-08-19T02:11:41  <AutomatedTester> ok, are you using the RC or WebDriver API?
2011-08-19T02:12:14  <cornelinux> The selenium IDE 1.1.0 for firefox on linux
2011-08-19T02:12:44  *** Binken_ has quit IRC
2011-08-19T02:13:16  <cornelinux> (I am quite new to selenium, so giving some answers will take its time)
2011-08-19T02:13:26  <AutomatedTester> its cool
2011-08-19T02:13:33  <AutomatedTester> so thats the RC API
2011-08-19T02:14:03  <AutomatedTester> so when you do click | locator where that is the ID to that element doesnt work?
2011-08-19T02:14:41  <cornelinux> I tried the xpath, i was told by firebug (click | //*[@id="realm_edit_click_lseAD"]) and also the id itself (click | id="realm_edit_click_lseAD")
2011-08-19T02:15:06  <cornelinux> ...and it didn't click
2011-08-19T02:15:23  <cornelinux> ..in fact it also did not record the event. I added it manually
2011-08-19T02:15:35  <AutomatedTester> ok, is it an ajax element?
2011-08-19T02:15:51  <AutomatedTester> i mean does it get added after the page loads?
2011-08-19T02:16:15  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, hi,I've created a python bindings web driver issue:http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2302
2011-08-19T02:16:26  <AutomatedTester> #2302
2011-08-19T02:16:27  <selbot2>  open/new IEDriver.dll is not installed correctly in win32 or x64 directory - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2302 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium OpSys-Windows Lang-Python]
2011-08-19T02:16:37  <AutomatedTester> it doesnt work at all?
2011-08-19T02:16:40  <cornelinux> it is pure javascript in the browser. Clicking the element changes the class of this element to display it in another color (i.e. select)
2011-08-19T02:16:54  <cornelinux> ...the page is not loaded
2011-08-19T02:17:00  <cornelinux> ...it is already loaded
2011-08-19T02:17:16  <AutomatedTester> huh
2011-08-19T02:17:25  <AutomatedTester> its not loaded , its already loaded?
2011-08-19T02:17:31  <AutomatedTester> they contradict
2011-08-19T02:18:08  <cornelinux> This page is already loaded. When I click the element, there is no new communication with the webserver. So element just changes its style in the browser
2011-08-19T02:18:42  <AutomatedTester> is there an onClick attached to the element
2011-08-19T02:19:08  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: firing up my VM
2011-08-19T02:19:16  <AutomatedTester> very surprised by this
2011-08-19T02:19:22  <Glynnis> Thanks
2011-08-19T02:19:33  <davehunt> freynaud: trying to replicate the Grid 2.x issue with three local machines. No luck so far :/
2011-08-19T02:22:12  <cornelinux> AutomatedTester: No, there is no classical onClick with this element. The functionality is handled by a jquery "selectable" function attached to the parent <ol> element

2011-08-19T02:23:57  <AutomatedTester> cornelinux: swap click for select and see if that works
2011-08-19T02:24:22  <AutomatedTester> andreashaas: ^ trunk is fixed
2011-08-19T02:24:55  <andreashaas> ok, thanks
2011-08-19T02:25:39  <davehunt> freynaud: 182 tests run without replicating the issue
2011-08-19T02:26:02  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: works with Python 2.6 on my VM
2011-08-19T02:26:11  <cornelinux> AutomatedTester: Swapping click for select gives me this:  Specified element is not a Select (has no options).
2011-08-19T02:26:45  <AutomatedTester> cornelinux: ok, you will need to use the fireEvent call maybe
2011-08-19T02:27:01  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, oh,works with 2.6? you mean IEDriver.dll is installed in correct directory ?
2011-08-19T02:27:16  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: installed in the correct place
2011-08-19T02:27:28  <AutomatedTester> I just did pip install selenium on my vm
2011-08-19T02:27:43  <AutomatedTester> and then in the REPL did from selenium import webdriver
2011-08-19T02:27:51  <AutomatedTester> ie = webdriver.Ie() and it loaded
2011-08-19T02:28:31  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, I install them by python setup.py install in the selenium-2.4.0,are they the same with pip?
2011-08-19T02:28:48  <AutomatedTester> Glynnis: from trunk?
2011-08-19T02:29:36  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, from the python binding  package I downloaded:
2011-08-19T02:29:46  <AutomatedTester> where did you download it?
2011-08-19T02:30:15  <AutomatedTester> sorry, none of this info is in the bug
2011-08-19T02:31:08  <cornelinux> AutomatedTester: hm, [info] Executing: |fireEvent | //*[@id="realm_edit_click_lseAD"] | click |  did not work either. ...is it possible to somehow change the styles (add classes, remove classes) using selenium?

2011-08-19T02:34:03  <Glynnis> AutomatedTester, I extracted the tar file by tar -zxvf selenium.tar.gz

2011-08-19T02:44:04  <ato> krosenvold: It, eh, depends how many externals that are coming.  Basically, we haven't got a legal permit to serve drinks.
2011-08-19T02:44:20  <ato> So my backup plan is to head to Schouskjelleren or GrÃ¼nerlÃ¸kka Brygghus.

2011-08-19T03:57:15  <ato> Pretty much.
2011-08-19T03:57:19  <ato> I'd recommend unstable.
2011-08-19T03:57:29  <krosenvold> Ouch. Is there something more trendy that is still not bleeding edge ?
2011-08-19T03:57:30  <ato> Debian 6 isn't that bad, though.
2011-08-19T03:57:38  <krosenvold> is that the one they used to call sid ?
2011-08-19T03:57:40  <ato> Debian has stable, unstable and testing.

Firefox appears to hang for him when calling webdriver.Firefox(). Killing the process results in "selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Can't load the profile. Profile Dir : /tmp/tmpZdSC2g". I took a look at firefox_binary.py and it looks like this is supposed to be raised after a 30 second timeout. I
2011-08-19T08:18:35  <kennethkoontz>  have a feeling that his iptables are strict, the blocking the port that webdriver connects to. What do you think the solution is?
2011-08-19T08:19:19  <AutomatedTester> kennethkoontz: it tries to connect to 127.0.0.1 not localhost if I remember correctly

2011-08-19T08:19:31  <AutomatedTester> so if he is IPv6 we cant really help
2011-08-19T08:19:46  <kennethkoontz> Correct, but the port that it connects appears to be random. Numbers in the dynamic IP range.

2011-08-19T08:21:03  <kennethkoontz> I mean dynamic port range.

2011-08-19T12:59:58  <CakeProphet> any idea why get_entire_page_screenshot would create multiple small PNG files instead of writing to one?
2011-08-19T13:03:49  <lukeis> what language / api is that in?
2011-08-19T13:03:59  *** nitin has quit IRC
2011-08-19T13:04:45  <CakeProphet> lukeis: python selenium 1
2011-08-19T13:05:52  <lukeis> hmm, i don't see it in Se 1 api's
2011-08-19T13:06:49  <lukeis> do you have your own extension that has that method?
2011-08-19T13:06:58  <CakeProphet> Not at all
2011-08-19T13:07:16  <CakeProphet> >>> s.capture_entire_page_screenshot
2011-08-19T13:07:18  <CakeProphet> <bound method selenium.capture_entire_page_screenshot of <selenium.selenium.selenium object at 0x23bfbd0>>
2011-08-19T13:07:32  <lukeis> ahhhh
2011-08-19T13:07:46  <lukeis> different than what you said before :)
2011-08-19T13:07:58  <CakeProphet> is it?
2011-08-19T13:08:12  <lukeis> get_entire_page_screenshot  != capture_entire_page_screenshot
2011-08-19T13:08:20  <CakeProphet> oh, right.
2011-08-19T13:08:25  <lukeis> was looking for what you said ... not what you meant
2011-08-19T13:09:46  <lukeis> i think the way RC works was that it had to take multiple screenshots in some browsers because it could only snapshot what was visible, then scroll and take another
2011-08-19T13:10:20  <lukeis> webdriver stitches it together
2011-08-19T13:11:21  <lukeis> note that every browser is potentially different
2011-08-19T13:11:51  <lukeis> with how it takes the screenshot... not to mention the way it renders ;)
2011-08-19T13:12:16  <CakeProphet> well, if I'm using Firefox, how would I get the whole image in one file?
2011-08-19T13:12:46  <lukeis> imagemagick?
2011-08-19T13:12:56  <CakeProphet> heh.
2011-08-19T13:12:57  <CakeProphet> okay.
2011-08-19T13:13:26  <lukeis> or switch to webdriver :)
2011-08-19T13:14:59  *** kennethkoontz has quit IRC
2011-08-19T13:15:35  <CakeProphet> I'm guessing webdriver is easier?
2011-08-19T13:15:38  <CakeProphet> or better rather.
2011-08-19T13:15:40  <lukeis> both
2011-08-19T13:16:15  <lukeis> just might take a little getting used to... but afterwards it's pretty easy to use

2011-08-19T13:18:18  <lukeis> although all of those would be good reading
2011-08-19T13:19:11  <CakeProphet> ah so webdriver doesn't require the selenium server.
2011-08-19T13:19:21  <lukeis> doesn't require it... but can use it

2011-08-19T13:28:26  <lukeis> and you no longer need browserbot
2011-08-19T13:28:56  <lukeis> ^ remove that :
2011-08-19T13:29:45  <CakeProphet> ah okay

2011-08-19T15:26:48  <mydog2> i've got a really basic issue that's causing me pain..
2011-08-19T15:26:58  <lukeis> ok, shoot
2011-08-19T15:27:18  <mydog2> i get a page.. and when i try to do an xpath on it.. the test crashes...
2011-08-19T15:27:30  <mydog2> i can see/display the page... so i have the data..
2011-08-19T15:28:01  <mydog2> i've written the html out to a file. .and parsed it with a test py script.. the data is there..
2011-08-19T15:28:19  <mydog2> but i can't figure out why the java is screwing up..
2011-08-19T15:28:27  <lukeis> how does the test crash? with a no such element exception?
2011-08-19T15:28:42  <mydog2> i also tried to simply do an xpath on it. .using java xpath libs.. with no luck!
2011-08-19T15:28:55  <mydog2> yeah...  as i recall..
2011-08-19T15:29:21  <mydog2> org.openqa.selenium.StaleElementReferenceException: Element not found
2011-08-19T15:29:34  <lukeis> ah, that's a different error
2011-08-19T15:29:46  <lukeis> did you see my email on the user list?
2011-08-19T15:29:50  <lukeis> downgrade to 2.3
2011-08-19T15:29:54  <mydog2> which wject..as odd.. as i wasn't using any sel ob
2011-08-19T15:29:55  <lukeis> might help you
2011-08-19T15:30:28  <mydog2> i thought 2.3 gave me issues with ff5..
2011-08-19T15:30:28  <lukeis> i would say upgrade to 2.5 cause the issue was fixed.... but it hasn't been released yet
2011-08-19T15:30:36  <lukeis> 2.3 and ff5 is ok
2011-08-19T15:30:40  <lukeis> ff6 not so much
2011-08-19T15:31:09  <mydog2> so how are your java skills regarding xpath?
2011-08-19T15:31:12  <lukeis> why haven't you moved on to using just chrome? :)
2011-08-19T15:31:14  <mydog2> the xapth works..
2011-08-19T15:31:21  <lukeis> xpath != java skills
2011-08-19T15:31:33  <mydog2> my understanding how to implement it in java sucks!
2011-08-19T15:31:42  <mydog2> or rather my java sucks..
2011-08-19T15:31:47  <lukeis> By.xpath("you xpath here")
2011-08-19T15:31:57  <mydog2> which is why i'm no longer slinging code!
2011-08-19T15:32:20  <mydog2> right.. and the xpath works.. as i verified in my test py app..
2011-08-19T15:32:39  <mydog2> i was simply trying to get a test java app to do the same as my py app..
2011-08-19T15:32:52  <lukeis> should be straight forward conversion
2011-08-19T15:33:03  <mydog2> let me paste it...

2011-08-19T15:37:38  <BenGrailsGuy> hi
2011-08-19T15:38:10  <BenGrailsGuy> Im having a hard time coming up with good tests to do on my form.
2011-08-19T15:38:20  <lukeis> mydog2: what line(s) should i be looking at?
2011-08-19T15:38:25  <mydog2> lukeis,  - pasted the test code.. had to email you the test data file..
2011-08-19T15:38:31  <BenGrailsGuy> i need some ideas.
2011-08-19T15:39:06  <mydog2> line 100 - 103
2011-08-19T15:39:07  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: valid input, invalid input, sql injection hacks, xss attacks
2011-08-19T15:39:41  <BenGrailsGuy> sql injection, hmm... I don't see how I'd know if my test hacked the form or not
2011-08-19T15:40:00  <BenGrailsGuy> but thats an interesting idea...
2011-08-19T15:40:44  <mydog2> lukeis,  - my bad.. lines 149-151
2011-08-19T15:40:47  <lukeis> mydog2: oh... you're trying to use xpath against an xml file loaded in memory
2011-08-19T15:41:05  <lukeis> i'm rusty on that
2011-08-19T15:41:19  <mydog2> ignore everything above line 113
2011-08-19T15:41:52  <mydog2> actaully.. i read in the html file "fat.html".. line 121
2011-08-19T15:42:08  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: add something like ' drop table users;  and query your db to make sure the database table is still there or not ;)
2011-08-19T15:42:30  <mydog2> and in lines 149-152 i try to do the xpath on it..
2011-08-19T15:42:46  <lukeis> mydog2: have you search stack exchange for something like that... i'm sure there's a few examples out there
2011-08-19T15:42:58  <mydog2> i should have cleaned up the test before i sent it to you.. my bad..
2011-08-19T15:43:10  <mydog2> i did...
2011-08-19T15:44:32  <mydog2> but the curious thing.. is that i have a test html file.. that pretty much has the html that i have in the java file.. and when i read it.. i can parse it.. no prob.. but it's a simple test. the "fat.html" is way more complex..  but the libxml in the py test works with no prob..
2011-08-19T15:44:53  <mydog2> i've been dealing with this since this am!
2011-08-19T15:45:05  <mydog2> thinking that i mush be missing something..
2011-08-19T15:45:18  <mydog2> also pinged the IRC java channel with no luck..
2011-08-19T15:45:19  <BenGrailsGuy> I wonder if there's a way to see if a button's onclick() method returned false....
2011-08-19T15:46:58  <lukeis> BenGrailsGuy: if the form it was apart of doesn't submit ... well that's if it's a submit type button
2011-08-19T15:48:17  <lukeis> mydog2: i usually use the org.w3c.dom.Documentclass for xml docs and there's a getElementsByTagName  method on that
2011-08-19T15:48:29  <lukeis> org.w3c.dom.Document  class
2011-08-19T15:48:48  <lukeis> (just looked at some of the code i'd written before)
2011-08-19T15:49:29  <mydog2> can you paste/send it to me..
2011-08-19T15:49:56  <mydog2> i'm assuming it allows for -->> //a[countents(... etc..
2011-08-19T15:50:49  <mydog2> and where the heck is the 2.3 release?
2011-08-19T15:51:07  <mydog2> i'm on the sel download page..
