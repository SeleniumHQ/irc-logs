2011-09-21T01:34:06  <Ajay> Hola simon
2011-09-21T01:34:07  <Stuk> simonstewart: yep
2011-09-21T01:35:25  <simonstewart> I'm compiling the operadriver from source using google's build system
2011-09-21T01:35:32  <Stuk> okey
2011-09-21T01:35:35  <simonstewart> and our (head) proto compiler
2011-09-21T01:35:41  <simonstewart> and I'm seeing some strange stuff
2011-09-21T01:35:51  <Stuk> hmmm
2011-09-21T01:36:05  <simonstewart> Did you get the email that I sent last night?
2011-09-21T01:36:06  <Stuk> Java errors?
2011-09-21T01:36:09  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-09-21T01:36:15  <simonstewart> Around the ecmascript_debugger
2011-09-21T01:36:23  <Stuk> haven't caught up with email yet :)
2011-09-21T01:36:26  <Stuk> but yes, it's here
2011-09-21T01:36:31  <simonstewart> Lucky soul
2011-09-21T01:37:02  <simonstewart> is ums/EcmaScriptDebugger.java using version 5 or 6.1?
2011-09-21T01:37:13  <simonstewart> of the ecmascript_debugger protos
2011-09-21T01:37:44  <simonstewart> I can patch various bits and pieces up and get everything compiling
2011-09-21T01:37:50  <Stuk> ums/EcmaScriptDebugger.java is using 5, but ums/EcmaScriptDebugger6.java extends it, and that's what we use
2011-09-21T01:38:02  <simonstewart> ok
2011-09-21T01:38:25  <simonstewart> I've not actually read the proto definitions: what's the difference between versions 5 and 6?
2011-09-21T01:39:06  <simonstewart> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZWaWrvJ7nA
2011-09-21T01:39:25  <Stuk> they're very similar, 6 adds some new messages, and some tiny backwards incompatible changes
2011-09-21T01:39:32  <Stuk> which is a pain
2011-09-21T01:39:49  <simonstewart> *sigh*
2011-09-21T01:40:15  <simonstewart> I note with interest that ObjectList is not defined in the ecmascript_debugger-5.0.proto but is used by the EcmaScriptDebugger.java
2011-09-21T01:40:54  <Stuk> looks like it is, on line 561
2011-09-21T01:43:16  *** ian_mac_ has quit IRC
2011-09-21T01:44:33  *** ian_mac_ has joined #selenium
2011-09-21T01:45:16  <Stuk> ah, okay, I see what's happening. The plain "ecmascript" service is upsetting the debugger service(s).
2011-09-21T01:45:29  <Stuk> how are you compiling the protos?
2011-09-21T01:48:51  <simonstewart> In bulk
2011-09-21T01:49:01  <simonstewart> with the two ecmascript_debugger protos being handled separately
2011-09-21T01:52:01  *** dave_miles_wfh has quit IRC
2011-09-21T01:53:21  <Stuk> okay, I see, when they're compiled at the same time they conflict, but when compiled separately they work
2011-09-21T01:53:30  <simonstewart> Right
2011-09-21T01:53:52  <Stuk> I added a script to the repo the other day, protos/compile.py, which strips out the extra Opera bits and compiles them separately, is that an option?
2011-09-21T01:54:19  <simonstewart> Not really. I need to compile them using the protocol compiler here
2011-09-21T01:54:22  <Stuk> and the reason we can get away with having the same messages defined, is because every scope message is wrapped in a UMS message, which tells us which service the message is from
2011-09-21T01:54:43  <simonstewart> Heh
2011-09-21T01:54:55  <Stuk> it's a bit of an interesting system :)
2011-09-21T01:55:00  <simonstewart> Right.
2011-09-21T01:55:16  <simonstewart> And the evolution of the protobufs is interesting
2011-09-21T01:55:38  <Stuk> it looks like if you could compile the ecmascript-1.0.proto file separately as well, then the errors would disappear
2011-09-21T01:55:42  <simonstewart> The normal way I've seen these things handled is by adding new fields to existing protos, or creating a brand new one
2011-09-21T01:56:12  <simonstewart> The only two I need to break out are the ecmascript_debugger protos
2011-09-21T01:56:15  *** stephend is now known as stephend|zzz
2011-09-21T01:56:19  <simonstewart> With those removed, I can compile in bulk
2011-09-21T01:57:16  <simonstewart> Interestingly, the version 6.1 debugger compiles into com/opera/core/systems/scope/protos/Esdbg6Protos
2011-09-21T01:57:32  <simonstewart> Which means that the EcmaScriptDebugger class gets terribly confused about life
2011-09-21T01:57:56  <Stuk> yes, it is incredibly confusing
2011-09-21T01:58:02  <simonstewart> Ha!
2011-09-21T01:58:25  <simonstewart> I may have to pull open an IDE soon
2011-09-21T01:58:26  <Stuk> there's a mapping from proto files to Java class names in that compile.py file I mentioned above :)
2011-09-21T01:58:49  <simonstewart> That's not really an option with the protoc I'm using
2011-09-21T01:58:55  <simonstewart> Or is it....
2011-09-21T01:59:01  * simonstewart goes and reads some docs
2011-09-21T01:59:29  <Stuk> the compile.py can take a --protoc= argument, if that helps
2011-09-21T01:59:39  <simonstewart> Interesting. You've got the same class names mentioned
2011-09-21T02:00:09  *** stackedsax has quit IRC
2011-09-21T02:01:42  <simonstewart> (as when I compile using the corp protoc)
2011-09-21T02:01:58  <simonstewart> Right this calls for an IDE
2011-09-21T02:02:13  <Stuk> :)
2011-09-21T02:08:33  <simonstewart> EcmaScriptDebugger.java refers to the non-existant com.opera.core.systems.scope.protos.EsdbgProtos.EvalResult;
2011-09-21T02:08:48  <simonstewart> which isn't defined in the ecmascript_debugger-5.0.proto
2011-09-21T02:10:00  <simonstewart> Which leads me to wonder how this compiles
2011-09-21T02:10:01  <Stuk> I can see "message EvalResult" on line 592
2011-09-21T02:10:12  <Stuk> is your IDE telling you that?
2011-09-21T02:10:25  <simonstewart> I can see "to highlight elements in the document"
2011-09-21T02:10:29  <simonstewart> Yeah.
2011-09-21T02:10:33  <simonstewart> going to the source
2011-09-21T02:10:57  <simonstewart> Odd
2011-09-21T02:11:06  <Stuk> line 540 when stripped out the extra stuff
2011-09-21T02:11:31  <simonstewart> OK. I'm going to regenerate the protos
2011-09-21T02:11:35  <simonstewart> Something's not right here

2011-09-21T04:31:11  <rockletsme> hi guys
2011-09-21T04:31:37  <rockletsme> how can i make a xpath   with following code = <input id="createUser:grantedRights:0" type="checkbox" name="createUser:grantedRights" value="7"/>
2011-09-21T04:32:19  <rockletsme> i would like to have something like this =  xpath=id(createUser:grantedRights)  BUT with the value 7 :-)
2011-09-21T04:32:26  <rockletsme> how can i will do it
2011-09-21T04:32:31  <rockletsme> could somebody helps me
2011-09-21T04:35:46  <rockletsme> xpath=id('createUser:grantedRights')
2011-09-21T04:36:04  <rockletsme> is getting all select boxes
2011-09-21T04:36:16  <rockletsme> but how can i get 1 of 19 select boxes
2011-09-21T04:36:21  <Wyccant> you can use firebug to get an xpath if you're stuck I think you need more of the DOM though
2011-09-21T04:36:47  <rockletsme> well firebug is giving me : html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/div[2]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td/form/table/tbody/tr/td/span/table/tbody/tr[5]/td[2]/table/tbody/tr[3]/td[1]/label/input
2011-09-21T04:36:54  <rockletsme> but i wont handle it like this

2011-09-21T04:41:29  <rockletsme> its so strange
2011-09-21T04:41:43  <Wyccant> you should probably use a css slector...

2011-09-21T04:46:31  <wyccant_> right, so you need to distinguish between them by narrowing it down through the DOM path to the one you want
2011-09-21T04:46:52  <rockletsme> wyccant  i am not so familer with DOM Path
2011-09-21T04:46:57  <rockletsme> can you help me ?
2011-09-21T04:47:42  <wyccant_> what i mean is you have to go up through the parents to find a way of making it unique, your xpath from fb looked correct
2011-09-21T04:47:55  <wyccant_> at least, it did having not seen your page
2011-09-21T04:50:14  <Parabola> rockletsme: you have to find the differences between each of the 19
2011-09-21T04:50:16  <Parabola> and then test each of them
2011-09-21T04:50:23  <Parabola> if they have the same name, that wont work, but some value will differ
2011-09-21T04:50:34  <rockletsme> the value is not same

2011-09-21T04:54:36  <wyccant_> rockletsme: firstly you can't have elements sharing ID, it's a unique property so you will never be able to achieve this and the page won't be valid and probably muck up your app

2011-09-21T05:02:10  <rockletsme> thanks for that TIP my Friends
2011-09-21T05:02:45  <RossPatterson> dawagner says in selenium-users: "We updated the version of the Apache HttpCore library we depend on from 4.0.3 to 4.1.2 in the 2.6 release.  Sounds like somewhere on your classpath you have a reference to 4.0.3 not 4.1.2.  Possibly through a transitive dependency for another library.  Make sure your classpath doesn't reference HttpCore 4.0.3."  Which is exactly why I love the server-in-the-middle model of Selenium RC and (I bel
2011-09-21T05:02:45  <RossPatterson> ieve) RemoteWebDriver - minimize the code that runs in-process and that can interfere with the application or automation.
2011-09-21T05:03:17  <wyccant_> please feel free to ask if you need more but I would go to manager and say you need to code review before testing
2011-09-21T05:03:41  <rockletsme> well i know it :-)
2011-09-21T05:03:48  <rockletsme> but its not so easy
2011-09-21T05:04:04  <rockletsme> we have nobody who is able to review the code

2011-09-21T05:04:51  <RossPatterson> rockletsme: As to your original problem, it's easy to identify elements even if they have non-unique IDs.

2011-09-21T05:07:14  <RossPatterson> " //input[@id='createUser:grantedRights:0' and @value='7']" means "select the INPUT element that has the ID attribute of createUser:grantedRights:0 and the VALUE attribute of '7'".
2011-09-21T05:08:38  <rockletsme> vie xpath is showing no only one checkbox and not all 19 pieces
2011-09-21T05:08:44  <rockletsme> but it is the wrong checkbox
2011-09-21T05:09:05  <rockletsme> input[@id='createUser:grantedRights:0' and @value='7']  is showing the checkbox with the number 1
2011-09-21T05:09:26  <RossPatterson> Thus: "//" - Start at the top of the document and go as deep as necessary; "input" - selecting only INPUT elements; "[...]" which match the contained conditions; "@id='...'" specifically ID=...; "@value='...'" and VALUE=...;
2011-09-21T05:09:39  <rockletsme> Ross :  NICE
2011-09-21T05:09:42  <rockletsme> really nice

2011-09-21T05:17:54  <rockletsme> clickandwait is not working
2011-09-21T05:18:18  <RossPatterson> You want to wait for the download to complete?
2011-09-21T05:18:20  <rockletsme> and i do not want to try it out with an timeout , because i really dont know the timeout
2011-09-21T05:18:25  <rockletsme> yes
2011-09-21T05:19:10  <rockletsme> i want to wait that the download is complete "maybe it would be  nice to give that aktion a path, which will be the download path as well"
2011-09-21T05:19:38  <RossPatterson> Unless the download process updates the page itself, that's not possible in Selenium.  The browsers do downloads outside the page, where Selenium can't see (or interact) with them.
2011-09-21T05:20:12  <rockletsme> so i have no change to get it with selenium ?
2011-09-21T05:20:26  <rockletsme> what is to wait for the finish ?
2011-09-21T05:20:37  <RossPatterson> Most folks who go down this path use OS-specific tools, like AutoIt (http://www.autoitscript.com) on Windows.
2011-09-21T05:20:47  <rockletsme> ok
2011-09-21T05:20:58  <rockletsme> autoit is working i know :-)
2011-09-21T05:21:20  <RossPatterson> For example, they wait for the download window to appear, click the SAVE button, and wait for it to disappear.
2011-09-21T05:21:20  <rockletsme> what i need would be a response to the page
2011-09-21T05:21:47  <RossPatterson> Are you using Selenium IDE?
2011-09-21T05:21:53  <rockletsme> your example : was with autoit
2011-09-21T05:22:09  <RossPatterson> Yes.
2011-09-21T05:22:23  <rockletsme> yes i am using the IDE beacuse nowbody at my company wants to have a framework "dont ask why" :-)
2011-09-21T05:22:54  <RossPatterson> btdtgtts.  Sorry, I don't think you can do this in IDE.
2011-09-21T05:22:56  <rockletsme> lets say i have written a autoit script  , how can i use with SELENIUM =?
2011-09-21T05:23:18  <rockletsme> i can program it with Csharp as well
2011-09-21T05:24:04  <simonstewart> :yt black betty ram jam
2011-09-21T05:24:05  <selbot2_> Ram Jam "Black Betty" - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMLnDuzgkjo&feature=youtube_gdata
2011-09-21T05:24:21  <RossPatterson> That's more like it, then.  With C# and the Selenium RC or WebDriver APIs, you can automate the test as in IDE, then run AutoIt (or whatever) wait for it to end, then continue the test.
2011-09-21T05:24:42  <rockletsme> many thanks

2011-09-21T05:44:50  <simonstewart> The IE driver
2011-09-21T05:45:25  <jimevans> that's extremely gratifying.
2011-09-21T05:45:36  <lord1234> jim, you really have done a huge amount of work on it.  You should get props
2011-09-21T05:45:49  <lord1234> i'd love to see a talk at SEconf about dealing with IE and wrangling its many pitfalls
2011-09-21T05:45:55  <lord1234> might be something to send to the M$ people
2011-09-21T05:46:52  <jimevans> i thought about doing such a talk at the last SeConf, but ended up not.
2011-09-21T05:47:03  <jimevans> "not" as in "not submitting"
2011-09-21T05:47:20  * simonstewart adds emailing out requests for interest to his todo list
2011-09-21T05:48:02  <jimevans> ultimately, I wasn't sure many folks would find it all that interesting after all.
2011-09-21T05:48:07  <simonstewart> I would
2011-09-21T05:48:12  <simonstewart> Love a nice technical talk
2011-09-21T05:48:12  <lord1234> i'd go
2011-09-21T05:48:20  <jimevans> well, that's two! :)
2011-09-21T05:49:21  <jimevans> there are a couple of nagging issues i'd love to find a real solution to, but have pretty much hit a brick wall with.
2011-09-21T05:49:23  *** cburroughs has joined #selenium
2011-09-21T05:50:10  <simonstewart> I'm tempted to fly to Redmond and see if I can get into the MS campus to chat with the IE team
2011-09-21T05:50:57  <jimevans> you might be able to finagle a meeting with (at least some of) them.
2011-09-21T05:51:11  <lord1234> "hi i'm simon"  "who?"  "simon, i bring cheese"  "oh ok sir, walk on in, here's mr gates"
2011-09-21T05:51:12  <simonstewart> We can hope
2011-09-21T05:51:39  <jimevans> your tech evangelism contacts might be of some help there too.
2011-09-21T05:51:52  <simonstewart> They no longer speak to me
2011-09-21T05:51:59  <simonstewart> Which is interesting
2011-09-21T05:52:03  <simonstewart> And a little depressing
2011-09-21T05:52:08  <simonstewart> wilhelm: yt?
2011-09-21T05:52:10  <jimevans> yikes!
2011-09-21T05:52:27  <simonstewart> I charitably believe that they're both very busy people

2011-09-21T05:53:26  <simonstewart> There's going to be the first meeting just after GTAC
2011-09-21T05:53:37  <simonstewart> Would love to know if MS are sending someone
2011-09-21T05:54:21  <lord1234> i can check if i can reach out to any MS people if u'd like
2011-09-21T05:54:34  <lord1234> i know someone reasonably high in their support org who migth have a contact or 2
2011-09-21T05:54:37  <simonstewart> please. We'd love them to be involved
2011-09-21T05:57:28  <jimevans> i finally got a reply from Phil Haack from when i reached out to him a few months back
2011-09-21T05:57:56  <jimevans> he's happy to retweet something if i can come up with something pithy, but that's about as far as he can go.
2011-09-21T05:58:17  <lord1234> lol jim!
2011-09-21T05:59:00  <lord1234> so, someone help me decide, I need a super powered desktop with some serious ram and processing power...any suggestions?  or should I just custom build it?

2011-09-21T05:59:19  <jimevans> i know Scott Hanselman has been working quietly from within, but it's certainly not highest on his priority list.
2011-09-21T05:59:31  <lord1234> its going to be used as our Jenkins CI platform, as well as by me to run tests on a day to day basis including using some serious pivot tables(we're talking pivot tables that are half a gig in size)
2011-09-21T05:59:34  <simonstewart> Good old Scott
2011-09-21T05:59:36  <simonstewart> We'll get there
2011-09-21T06:00:13  <Wyccant> simonstewart: I have converted the tests to webdriver (is junit webdriver right?) no longer getting blank page with address bar icon, now getting standard droid 404 page.
2011-09-21T06:00:17  <jimevans> one way or another we will.

2011-09-21T06:06:04  <simonstewart> lord1234: I think that krosenvold is the current king of the heap when it comes to hardware
2011-09-21T06:06:12  <simonstewart> Might be a good idea to talk to him

2011-09-21T06:06:45  <dawagner> jimevans: Is there a reason we don't use keepalive in mongoose in the IEDriver?
2011-09-21T06:06:57  <Wyccant> lord1234: I'd go ssd over a large platter. if you need storage a mybook which will act as server. but that's just my setup
2011-09-21T06:06:57  <lord1234> sorta like candyman?  krosenvold krosenvold krosenvold
2011-09-21T06:07:07  <simonstewart> DON'T SAY THAT!

2011-09-21T06:07:19  <lord1234> simonstewart: lol
2011-09-21T06:07:47  <jimevans> dawagner: there were some problems in the keep-alive  implementation in the version of mongoose in the IE driver.
2011-09-21T06:08:07  <jimevans> i tried enabling it at one point, but it seemed to cause trouble.
2011-09-21T06:08:17  <jimevans> maybe it's time to investigate further.
2011-09-21T06:08:19  <dawagner> What kind of trouble?
2011-09-21T06:08:20  <lord1234> funny enough the best option looks like a gaming machine
2011-09-21T06:08:27  <barancev> simonstewart: have you tried Alex Mogilevsky of MS? he is an architect of layout engine and a W3C CSS WG member
2011-09-21T06:08:43  <jimevans> like the server wouldn't shut down properly.
2011-09-21T06:08:47  <jimevans> biab.
2011-09-21T06:08:50  <simonstewart> No I haven't, barancev
2011-09-21T06:08:54  <Wyccant> gaming machines always have the best grunt

2011-09-21T06:09:36  <lord1234> thats a SERIOUS graphics card
2011-09-21T06:09:43  <simonstewart> With modern browsers, there might actually be a case to be made for a decent graphics card
2011-09-21T06:10:03  <RossPatterson> Especially with OSes starting to treat GPUs as additional CPUs.
2011-09-21T06:10:19  <simonstewart> See: the Amiga got it right
2011-09-21T06:10:48  <dawagner> jimevans: Always or occasionally? I've got them enabled with the mongoose's HEAD in the ChromeDriver because of #2513, which fixes the issue, though I have got a couple of new failures to investigate because of it
2011-09-21T06:10:49  <selbot2_> dawagner open/accepted ChromeDriver and InternetExplorerDriver NoHttpResponseException since 2.6.0 - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=2513 [Type-Defect Priority-High Component-WebDriver Browser-Chrome Browser-IE]
2011-09-21T06:10:49  <Wyccant> nice looking machine. I just put an nvidia 450 in my machine everything improved cos less redraw for cpu to do
2011-09-21T06:10:52  <RossPatterson> Don't be dissing pre-Commode-or Amigas.  AmigaOs rocked.
2011-09-21T06:11:06  <lord1234> i still prefer OS2

2011-09-21T07:19:48  <simonstewart> Wyccant: short answer: you can't use your HTML test suites with the android driver
2011-09-21T07:20:53  <simonstewart> You must convert them first to the webdriver API, and run them as code using the androiddriver
2011-09-21T07:21:04  <simonstewart> You can export the tests as webdriver ones from the IDE
2011-09-21T07:21:23  <Wyccant> yup I did that. junit (webdriver) is right?
2011-09-21T07:21:52  <simonstewart> And once that's done, you need to invoke the tests as normal junit tests
2011-09-21T07:22:18  <simonstewart> Your command line doesn't look right for that

2011-09-21T07:36:29  <Stuk> Ajay: I'm not actually sure, I think Identify changes only part of the user-agent, so it looks some thing like Firefox powered by Presto, whereas Mask changes it to be the exact same as Firefox

2011-09-21T07:36:49  <andreastt> Ajay, Stuk: Identify as uses another User-Agent string, but still appends Opera to it.
2011-09-21T07:36:59  <andreastt> Ajay, Stuk: Mask as completely masks Opera as another browser.

2011-09-21T08:09:42  <simonstewart> You won't need the webdriver server if you've got the APK running on the android device
2011-09-21T08:10:35  <simonstewart> Try starting the webdriver app on the android device and connecting to http://127.0.0.1:8080/wd/hub
2011-09-21T08:11:07  <Wycccant> ow will it know where to get the tests from?
2011-09-21T08:11:23  <simonstewart> ok. We need to take a step back, I think
2011-09-21T08:11:36  <simonstewart> You've exported the tests as java (I'm guessing)
2011-09-21T08:11:43  <Wycccant> yes
2011-09-21T08:11:47  <simonstewart> They're using a framework called JUnit
2011-09-21T08:11:51  <simonstewart> http://junit.org
2011-09-21T08:12:14  <Wycccant> I believe so. I exported as jUnit (webdriver)
2011-09-21T08:12:19  <simonstewart> You need to get a junit runner to run the tests, which will then connect to the android driver
2011-09-21T08:12:25  <simonstewart> There's a few ways of doing this
2011-09-21T08:12:35  <simonstewart> Are you using an IDE, such as Eclipse of IntelliJ?
2011-09-21T08:13:16  <simonstewart> Or living entirely on the command line?
2011-09-21T08:13:24  <Wycccant> no. I have to get the to run from cmd line
2011-09-21T08:13:27  <simonstewart> OK
2011-09-21T08:13:36  <simonstewart> So the first step is to compile the Java code
2011-09-21T08:13:43  <simonstewart> Are you familiar with how to do that?
2011-09-21T08:14:16  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-09-21T08:14:42  <Wycccant> no, and this is where you'll start banging your head on desk along with me. I normally do client side code, but the team (sorry) don't like doing selenium tests so they dumped it on the contractor that vaguely knows android's browsers

2011-09-21T08:18:30  <Wycccant> and in my current position I can't afford not to deliver whatever is asked of me (>_<)
2011-09-21T08:18:42  <simonstewart> So: we're at "how to compile code using javac on the command line"
2011-09-21T08:19:04  <simonstewart> First question: do you have javac on your PATH?
2011-09-21T08:19:21  *** Ajay has quit IRC
2011-09-21T08:19:43  <Wycccant> I have JDK if that's what you mean
2011-09-21T08:19:53  <simonstewart> Cool
2011-09-21T08:20:00  <simonstewart> Are you running Windows, OS X or Linux
2011-09-21T08:20:03  <simonstewart> ?
2011-09-21T08:20:11  <simonstewart> Windows, presumably
2011-09-21T08:20:12  <Wycccant> windows
2011-09-21T08:20:28  <simonstewart> So in a command prompt, what happens if you run "javac -help"
2011-09-21T08:20:52  <Wycccant> I get usage instructions
2011-09-21T08:21:08  <simonstewart> Great, so you have javac on the PATH
2011-09-21T08:21:13  <simonstewart> This makes life a lot easier :)
2011-09-21T08:21:21  <simonstewart> So, first step is to compile the code
2011-09-21T08:21:37  <Wycccant> each test case?
2011-09-21T08:21:52  <simonstewart> We'll compile all the classes at the same time
2011-09-21T08:21:56  <simonstewart> md out
2011-09-21T08:22:32  <simonstewart> javac -classpath path\to\selenium-server-standalone.jar -d out src/**
2011-09-21T08:23:08  <simonstewart> (it's been a long time since I did this on the command line, and even longer than windows, so I may not get everything exactly right)
2011-09-21T08:23:25  <Wycccant> like this: javac -classpath C:\_selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.5.0.jar -d out C:\_selenium\    ?
2011-09-21T08:24:08  <simonstewart> Assuming that the ".java" files exported by IDE are in c:\_selenium. You'll need a "**" at the end too
2011-09-21T08:24:51  <simonstewart> Because you're telling the command the actual files to compile
2011-09-21T08:24:58  <simonstewart> It doesn't just take a directory
2011-09-21T08:26:07  <Wycccant> so: javac -classpath C:\_selenium\selenium-server-standalone-2.5.0.jar -d C:\_selenium\tests\webdriver\*.*     which says "not a directory c:\_selenium\tests\webdriver\artEvoaccordian.java
2011-09-21T08:26:32  <simonstewart> "-d out" followed by the files
2011-09-21T08:26:42  <simonstewart> Assuming that you've already run "md out"
2011-09-21T08:27:23  *** cerberos has quit IRC

2011-09-21T08:28:05  <simonstewart> Which symbol?
2011-09-21T08:28:55  <Wycccant> I see the cause, the suite is trying to call other suites which aren't there. I'll delete those references and come back to it
2011-09-21T08:29:04  <simonstewart> ok
2011-09-21T08:31:09  <Wycccant> nope, wrong on that. it's calling suite.addTestSuite(filename.class);  where the filename is a testcase

2011-09-21T08:33:41  <ruel> particular issue
2011-09-21T08:33:49  <ruel> is there anything that I can do in my tests to avoid it?
2011-09-21T08:34:00  <ruel> e.g.  certain pauses or sleeps?
2011-09-21T08:34:02  <simonstewart> Wycccant: so, are you compiling all the java files at the same time?
2011-09-21T08:34:08  <ruel> its the the only intermittent failure i'm running into
2011-09-21T08:34:30  <simonstewart> (this would be a 10 minute job if we were in the same office)
2011-09-21T08:34:32  <Wycccant> they're all in the ...\tests\webdriver directory
2011-09-21T08:34:44  <simonstewart> Brilliant
2011-09-21T08:35:13  <simonstewart> So you're compiling with "javac -classpath path\to\selenium-server-standalone.jar -d out tests\webdriver\*.java"
2011-09-21T08:35:22  <simonstewart> Which should compile everything in one fell swoop
2011-09-21T08:35:39  <Wycccant> I had *.*   *.java is same deal
2011-09-21T08:35:45  <simonstewart> Assuming that TestSuite_ArtEvo is in that directory too
2011-09-21T08:35:58  <Wycccant> yes
2011-09-21T08:36:06  <simonstewart> hmmm....
2011-09-21T08:36:36  <Wycccant> is it relevant that the others are test cases not test suites?
2011-09-21T08:37:39  <simonstewart> nope. That should be fine
2011-09-21T08:37:49  <simonstewart> as long as each class being added extends TestCase

2011-09-21T10:07:58  <RandLAT> in Selenium IDE, I want to verifyTextPresent within children of a particular div but I don't know which child. Is there an easy way to check for that?

2011-09-21T10:09:24  <andytinkham> lord1234: In case you don't have it after all, it might be easier to use find_elements and look at the length of the returned array

2011-09-21T10:10:28  <lord1234> what I am trying now is https://gist.github.com/1232712  but the array is ALWAYS nil(even though I know it shouldn't be nil at some point....)
2011-09-21T10:11:04  <lord1234> RandLAT: also the same question I ask people elsewhere...why are you using IDE for test cases this complex?
2011-09-21T10:11:13  <lord1234> ...you should be using Webdriver or *shudder* RC
2011-09-21T10:12:42  <andytinkham> lord1234: When I call find_elements, I use 2 args (:css, and then the stuff you have after the =>). Maybe try that instead of giving it a hash?
2011-09-21T10:13:16  <lord1234> am I not doing that?
2011-09-21T10:13:19  <andytinkham> lord1234: Also, a more Ruby way to write the loop would be '10.times do |i|' instead of 'for i in 1..10'
2011-09-21T10:13:26  <lord1234> how am I using a hash there?
2011-09-21T10:14:11  <andytinkham> lord1234: You're giving one parameter: ':css => "div[id^='tb#{i}']"' which I've always seen translate to a hash with a single key (:css) and value (everything after =>)
2011-09-21T10:14:50  <andytinkham> What I see in my code where we call find_elements would be this: @driver.find_elements(:css, "div[id^='tb#{i}']")

2011-09-21T10:18:30  <lord1234> correct
2011-09-21T10:18:36  <lord1234> RC is selenium1

2011-09-21T10:22:44  <jimevans> heh. this isn't even about IDE. :)
2011-09-21T10:22:51  <lord1234> i know you love RC too....
2011-09-21T10:22:55  <andytinkham> lord1234: Actually, a concise way to write that whole loop would be instance_id = (1..10).find { |i| $browser.find_elements(:css, "div[id^='tb#{i}']").size > 0 }
2011-09-21T10:23:13  <lord1234> but why overcomplicate it?
2011-09-21T10:23:18  <ian_mac_> so jimevans, what would you recommend using - Selenium 1 or Selenium 2?
2011-09-21T10:23:21  <lord1234> i would think a statement like that would be prone to bugginess....

2011-09-21T10:23:28  <lord1234> no arguemnt
2011-09-21T10:23:39  <jimevans> i recommend using Selenium WebDriver, which is only available in Selenium 2.
2011-09-21T10:24:09  <andytinkham> Basically find on an array returns the first instance that returns true from the block, so it's doing what you're spelling out
2011-09-21T10:24:11  <jimevans> as opposed to Selenium RC, which is available in both Selenium 1 and Selenium 2.
2011-09-21T10:24:22  <ian_mac_> jimevans: sorry, I was trolling :P
2011-09-21T10:24:29  <ian_mac_> I'll stop
2011-09-21T10:24:56  <jimevans> hey, adam's not here. somebody's got to pick up the "Selenium 2 is a version, not an API" banner. :)
2011-09-21T10:25:09  <ian_mac_> hehe
2011-09-21T10:25:46  <lord1234> andy new question, https://gist.github.com/1232759  why would instance_id be "undefined" by the time we get to line9?
2011-09-21T10:26:10  <andytinkham> Is it used at all before line 1?
2011-09-21T10:26:19  <lord1234> no
2011-09-21T10:26:49  <andytinkham> Set it to something before line 1 then. The way it's written, it's being defined as a local variable inside the block being passed to 10.times
2011-09-21T10:26:58  <lord1234> oh ok
2011-09-21T10:28:00  <RandLAT> lord1234: That said, any help would be appreciated for IDE. would my target (for verifyText(Not)Present) be something along the lines of xpath=//div[id@'name']/div or //id('name')/div ? I can't seem to make either work
2011-09-21T10:28:01  <andytinkham> lord1234: Honestly though, unless you really need that puts rownum statement, you could replace line 4 with line 9 directly (replacing instance_id with i)
2011-09-21T10:28:44  <lord1234> ui make a good point
2011-09-21T10:29:06  <lord1234> xpath might be //div[@id='name']

2011-09-21T10:30:56  <lord1234> also xpath and IE don't cooperate well together.
2011-09-21T10:31:38  <RandLAT> that div has no id, though I do know the id of one of its (grand-)parent, which is reason for my dilemma to begin with, if I knew the id of that div, would jump straight to it

2011-09-21T10:39:28  <andytinkham> lord1234: Actually in your latest gist, it might not do exactly the same. Before, you were getting i = 1, 2, ..., 10. Now you'll get i = 0, 1, ..., 9. Might need to add a +1 in your find_elements call

2011-09-21T11:00:23  <RandLAT> update: I was able to verifyText for a specific div, but I have to "count" the div, for example: //div[@id='name']/div[2]/div[5]/label. This verifies the label of the 5th div (parent) of the 2nd div (grandparent) of the specified div.
2011-09-21T11:00:48  <lord1234> RandLAT: as I asked before

2011-09-21T11:01:13  <lord1234> just the piece we're working with...
2011-09-21T11:07:29  <simonstewart> Find the element, then execute some JS to grab the innerHTML

2011-09-21T11:08:36  <lord1234> simon what are u listening to these days?
2011-09-21T11:08:56  <simonstewart> Currently? jimevans's wife's radio show

2011-09-21T11:09:40  <simonstewart> jimevans knows the best ones to share
2011-09-21T11:11:54  <barancev> simonstewart: what's with FF in HEAD? go firefox_test does not work for me -- empty browser window is all I can get
2011-09-21T11:12:14  <simonstewart> that's not good
2011-09-21T11:12:17  <simonstewart> Do a clean first
2011-09-21T11:12:32  <simonstewart> If it's still broken, then take a look at the Error Console
2011-09-21T11:12:58  <barancev> simonstewart: yes, clean build in progress
2011-09-21T11:13:41  <simonstewart> cool
2011-09-21T11:13:49  <barancev> simonstewart: btw, if you are not very busy ATM, could you grant rights to me and Ajay?
2011-09-21T11:13:54  <RSchulzB> We're seeing a high incidence of cases where Firefox (using WebDriver) hangs, usually with elevated CPU usage and the WebDriver indicator stuck on red. Is this a known issue?
2011-09-21T11:14:17  <simonstewart> barancev: It's on my TODO list before leaving the office. Promise
2011-09-21T11:14:28  <simonstewart> RSchulzB: nope. new to me
2011-09-21T11:14:38  <simonstewart> Is there a reproducible test case?
2011-09-21T11:14:46  <simonstewart> (even if we need to run it loads of times)
2011-09-21T11:14:47  <RSchulzB> It's quite unpredictable.
2011-09-21T11:14:57  <RSchulzB> I don't know how I'd do that.
2011-09-21T11:15:06  <barancev> simonstewart: thanks
2011-09-21T11:15:25  <simonstewart> "that" being a reproducible test case?
2011-09-21T11:15:30  <RSchulzB> Yes.
2011-09-21T11:15:38  <RSchulzB> How I could allow you to reproduce it, that is.
2011-09-21T11:16:04  <RSchulzB> For one thing, in Selenium 2 it's hard to tell which test from our suite is running at any given time...
2011-09-21T11:16:13  <simonstewart> Are you tests against an public site? Or something behind your corp firewall
2011-09-21T11:16:16  <simonstewart> ?
2011-09-21T11:16:21  <RSchulzB> All proprietary.
2011-09-21T11:16:28  <simonstewart> Doesn't your test runner report the current test?
2011-09-21T11:16:51  <RSchulzB> We run dozens of them in parallel using an EC2-based grid.
2011-09-21T11:17:03  <simonstewart> Ahhh...
2011-09-21T11:17:08  <simonstewart> OK. That's trickier
2011-09-21T11:17:19  <lord1234> RSchulzB: i jsut started encountering this today too a bit
2011-09-21T11:17:19  <RSchulzB> One used to see it in the browser itself, of course, but no more...
2011-09-21T11:17:26  <lord1234> do you get a JS event hanging it?
2011-09-21T11:17:40  <RSchulzB> I don't understand that question.
2011-09-21T11:17:48  <lord1234> does firefox pop up a "stop script" window when it hangs?
2011-09-21T11:17:58  <lord1234> (after a while?)
2011-09-21T11:18:17  <RSchulzB> I've seen them a couple of times, but definitely not all the hangs have that symptom.
2011-09-21T11:20:35  <jimevans> lord1234: pilot for her new show is the 09/19/11 link at http://www.wgch.com/showarchive/hwcr.shtml
2011-09-21T11:20:51  <RSchulzB> I've got an incidence in front of me right now.
2011-09-21T11:21:00  <RSchulzB> Is there anything diagnostic I can do?
2011-09-21T11:21:20  <simonstewart> RSchulzB: if you take a look at the Firefox Error Console (in the Tools menu) what command does it claim to be executing?
2011-09-21T11:21:32  <simonstewart> Is it always the same one? Or a different command each time?
2011-09-21T11:21:52  <barancev> simonstewart: clean build does not work either
2011-09-21T11:22:04  <simonstewart> Furrfu
2011-09-21T11:22:05  <RandLAT> lord1234: since you insisted, I cleaned up the code keeping only the skeleton, and here it is: https://gist.github.com/1232883. What you should know is that JS is used to hide all but 5 of those 17 "blocks"
2011-09-21T11:22:07  <simonstewart> OK
2011-09-21T11:22:13  <RSchulzB> There are a great number of "Empty string passed to GetElementById()."
2011-09-21T11:22:23  <simonstewart> That doesn't sound good
2011-09-21T11:22:27  * barancev is moving back in time
2011-09-21T11:23:12  <RSchulzB> Is that likely a bug in our Selenium test?
2011-09-21T11:24:15  <barancev> Ошибка: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570015 (NS_ERROR_XPC_CI_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.createInstance]"  nsresult: "0x80570015 (NS_ERROR_XPC_CI_RETURNED_FAILURE)"  location: "JS frame :: chrome://fxdriver/content/server.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 26"  data: no]
2011-09-21T11:24:16  <lord1234> RandLAT: and you are trying to pull for example the element identified by RSchulzB <label for="">Label16</label>?
2011-09-21T11:24:32  <lord1234> ignore the RSchulzB part....lol

2011-09-21T11:41:18  <simonstewart> How's it going?

2011-09-21T11:41:55  <jleyba> Planning on spending it burning my eyes away on the iMac
2011-09-21T11:42:03  <simonstewart> I love my iMac
2011-09-21T11:42:10  <simonstewart> It's stupidly fast
2011-09-21T11:42:35  <jleyba> Sadly, all my work is on the mb pro, so I'm just using the iMac as an external display
2011-09-21T11:42:42  <simonstewart> :(
2011-09-21T11:42:53  <simonstewart> The OSS stuff can be done on the iMac

2011-09-21T11:43:06  <jleyba> True, but I'm too lazy to transfer files over
2011-09-21T11:43:10  <simonstewart> I may have to get my hands on a mini-displayport to mini-displayport adapter though
2011-09-21T11:43:15  <simonstewart> heh
2011-09-21T11:43:22  <simonstewart> Commit them and then check 'em out?
2011-09-21T11:43:40  <jleyba> Sure, if I wanted to do it the easy way
2011-09-21T11:43:55  <simonstewart> But where's the challenge in that?
2011-09-21T11:44:18  <jleyba> and who needs svn commits or git when you've got intellij's local file history :)
2011-09-21T11:44:28  <simonstewart> I just had to nuke my caches
2011-09-21T11:44:35  <simonstewart> So "me" would be the answer there

2011-09-21T11:46:36  <simonstewart> Yes, we have a key

2011-09-21T11:46:49  <simonstewart> I can IM it to you
2011-09-21T11:47:44  <jleyba> on now
2011-09-21T11:49:25  <RandLAT> lord1234: yes, it would have been nice to be able to know that "some text" is within a descendant of a particular div, without having to count "this is the N'th child of div name"
2011-09-21T11:50:25  <RandLAT> lord1234: and before someone else mentions why not use VerifyTextPresent (in the entire page) well what I am looking for is in other parts of the page, that's why I wanted to restrict myself to a specific div
2011-09-21T11:51:07  <lord1234> can u tell me what for="" actually equals?
2011-09-21T11:51:10  <lord1234> cuz you can do that by CSS probably....
2011-09-21T11:51:19  <lord1234> unless all the for "" elements are equal?
2011-09-21T11:51:32  <lord1234> but I can definitely make your xpath smaller probably....
2011-09-21T11:52:50  <RandLAT> all the label's for tags are different. To me this isn't an ideal way to search for it either since if I used firebug to look for exact div name, then it would be the same amount of work to look for a specific label.

2011-09-21T12:49:41  <Dude-X> well on my project we just use override click to wait for an element to be visible, ignoring excpetions until the timeout occurs

2011-09-21T12:51:14  <barancev> algard`: use implicit waits
2011-09-21T12:51:45  <algard`> my problem is I have two buttons on a page, both loaded already, and I want to click one, which reloads the page, and then click the other
2011-09-21T12:52:05  <algard`> so at the moment Selenium is just clicking both, before the first one has a chance to reload the page(it's submitting a POST form)
2011-09-21T12:53:45  <barancev> well, make a short sleep after the first click (to make sure the form is submitted) and then wait for thу second button using either implicit or explicit wait
2011-09-21T13:02:27  <algard`> i guess that'll work

2011-09-21T13:05:18  <cgoldberg> magicblaze0071, are you trying to use selenium, or webdriver?
2011-09-21T13:05:35  <cgoldberg> magicblaze0071, which API?
2011-09-21T13:06:10  <cgoldberg> magicblaze0071, i'm asking, because for webdriver, you don't necessarily need to run the server at all
2011-09-21T13:06:17  <magicblaze0071> I'm just trying to use python to goto a webpage and read/parse some data

2011-09-21T13:06:46  <Dude-X> go to a webpage to read data?
2011-09-21T13:06:50  <cgoldberg> magicblaze0071, then just use webdriver.. skip selenium and the server piece.. webdriver is part of selenium2
2011-09-21T13:06:51  <magicblaze0071> This seems to work --> selenium = selenium("localhost", 4444, "*firefox", "http://google.com/") \n selenium.start()
2011-09-21T13:06:58  <Dude-X> you can use urllib2 or httplib2

2011-09-21T13:07:22  <Dude-X> oh java script… then webdriver will be good :D

2011-09-21T13:10:19  <cgoldberg> magicblaze0071, do you just want the page source?  or you want to interact with elements on the page?

2011-09-21T13:19:41  <Dude-X> if it changes, i would simply wait for the new element you're expecting

2011-09-21T13:20:17  <magicblaze0071> it might change after an hour or a few seconds
2011-09-21T13:20:38  <Dude-X> after an hour!?
2011-09-21T13:20:43  <Dude-X> then um
2011-09-21T13:20:57  <magicblaze0071> ah internally, its just polling every 500 milliseconds, isnt that bad design?
2011-09-21T13:20:58  <Dude-X> i think you're using webdriver in a unconventional manner.
2011-09-21T13:21:20  <Dude-X> not really, given the constraints of the driver
2011-09-21T13:21:49  <magicblaze0071> well, then cant i just read the source of the page in a forever loop?
2011-09-21T13:21:58  <magicblaze0071> or with a delay
2011-09-21T13:22:16  <lukeis> the python api let's you change the interval
2011-09-21T13:22:40  <Dude-X> kind of, but javascript doesn't execute if you just get the raw data programmatically
2011-09-21T13:22:52  <magicblaze0071> I guess WebDriverWait is available only after 2.4+ and I'm on 2.3+...

2011-09-21T13:23:17  <Dude-X> you should use 2.4, i 2.0final to 2.3 didn't work on my project
2011-09-21T13:23:29  <Dude-X> 2.5 is also fine
2011-09-21T13:23:37  <Dude-X> though the latest is 2.6
2011-09-21T13:24:55  <barancev> 2.5 is the most stable atm
2011-09-21T13:25:01  <magicblaze0071> just installed 2.6 on my windows box
2011-09-21T13:25:14  <magicblaze0071> i do have a script that used to run with selenium server 2.3 -- i hope it doesnt break
2011-09-21T13:25:16  <barancev> 2.6 has serious issues with FF
2011-09-21T13:25:37  <barancev> 2.3 has solid IE-specific bugs
2011-09-21T13:26:06  <magicblaze0071> I already did pip install selenium
2011-09-21T13:26:16  <barancev> 2.4 and 2.5 are good enough
2011-09-21T13:26:19  <magicblaze0071> And I do use firefox from the other script that used to work with 2.3
2011-09-21T13:26:31  <magicblaze0071> can i use pip to move back to 2.5?

2011-09-21T13:34:04  <cgoldberg> lukeis.. thats 1
2011-09-21T13:34:10  <selbot2_> ["502 Bad Gateway", "/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/rest-client-1.6.1/lib/restclient/abstract_response.rb:48:in `return!'"]
2011-09-21T13:34:19  <lukeis> ahh... darn google code
2011-09-21T13:34:21  <cgoldberg> the other I have is the scroll losing focus..
2011-09-21T13:34:40  <lukeis> i wouldn't turn people away from it though, unless they hit your same issues
2011-09-21T13:35:31  <cgoldberg> lukeis, it's pretty bad imo
2011-09-21T13:36:02  * lukeis has been running it on a subset of test cases and hasn't had a big issue
2011-09-21T13:36:55  <cgoldberg> for example.. typical beginner path would be:  read docs -> try example.  the canonical example given (go to google and search) doesn't work in 2.6.0 because of #2487.  i wouldn't want to send someone down that path, that's all
2011-09-21T13:37:13  <lukeis> yeah, but there's a work-around... adding element.clear
2011-09-21T13:37:26  <lukeis> I'll update the example if it'll make ya happy :)

2011-09-21T15:35:11  <Renacor> is there a way to set a proxy to go through on the fly in selenium?
2011-09-21T15:35:24  <Renacor> instead of starting the selenium server with a specific proxy
2011-09-21T15:35:53  <lukeis> none that i know of... you have to start the browser with the proxy
2011-09-21T15:36:42  <Renacor> does the browser not get started at the beginning of each script?
2011-09-21T15:37:38  <lukeis> depends on what you are using.... WebDriver and scripts you can start multiple browsers and don't have to at the beginning
2011-09-21T15:38:18  <lukeis> IDE is only selenium, so in that case I think you can only have one
2011-09-21T15:38:19  <Renacor> I need something where I can start the same script but different proxy servers
2011-09-21T15:38:46  <lukeis> what are you using? (What language? What API?)
2011-09-21T15:38:49  <Renacor> no way to do that in selenium?
2011-09-21T15:38:49  <Renacor> php
2011-09-21T15:39:58  <lukeis> i'm not familiar very familiar with php bindings.... but you could just have some environment variable or other configuration that feeds into your test (which would be the proxy info) and you set your test accordingly
2011-09-21T15:40:21  <Renacor> ill dig
