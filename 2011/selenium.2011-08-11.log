2011-08-11T03:01:49  <AutomatedTester> hi baijum
2011-08-11T03:02:06  <baijum> Did you see the comments here http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1930 ?
2011-08-11T03:02:57  <baijum> I just started experimenting with readthedocs.org :) http://selenium-python.readthedocs.org
2011-08-11T03:04:16  <AutomatedTester> i hadnt seen it
2011-08-11T03:05:30  <baijum> ah. ok
2011-08-11T03:05:48  <baijum> readthedocs site allows to manage multiple versions of docs.  For every version (preferably MINOR versions) we can have separate versions of docs
2011-08-11T03:08:33  <AutomatedTester> cool

2011-08-11T03:12:33  <simonstewart> greets
2011-08-11T03:12:48  <AutomatedTester> has there been a change to the alerts code that I should be aware of
2011-08-11T03:12:51  <AutomatedTester> have a test failing
2011-08-11T03:13:03  <simonstewart> Daniel checked in something about a week ago
2011-08-11T03:13:09  <AutomatedTester> with WebDriverException: Message: u'a.document.getElementsByTagName("dialog")[0] is undefined'
2011-08-11T03:13:41  <simonstewart> interesting.
2011-08-11T03:13:48  <simonstewart> is the alert opening as window or app modal?
2011-08-11T03:14:02  <AutomatedTester> looks app modal
2011-08-11T03:14:21  <simonstewart> good
2011-08-11T03:14:56  <AutomatedTester> quick question, if I send an int to send_keys should I convert or throw an error
2011-08-11T03:15:10  <simonstewart> convert
2011-08-11T03:15:19  <AutomatedTester> hmm that test just passed now
2011-08-11T03:15:21  <AutomatedTester> weird
2011-08-11T03:16:20  <AutomatedTester> hmm ok
2011-08-11T03:16:34  <simonstewart> that message normally indicates that the alert didn't open
2011-08-11T03:16:40  <simonstewart> Or did, but didn't render in time

2011-08-11T03:18:23  <simonstewart> indeed

2011-08-11T03:18:46  <AutomatedTester> hopefully it can get fixed rather than back out at the end of the day

2011-08-11T03:27:59  <simonstewart> They want to type a number, though?
2011-08-11T03:28:25  <AutomatedTester> sure but if its a number that isnt base 10?
2011-08-11T03:28:32  <naeg> simonstewart: and how can i? I'm using find_element_by_partial_link_text and i know it's the right link because of the .text attribute, but .click() does nothing

2011-08-11T03:30:39  <simonstewart> It might be worth finding out which link has been found
2011-08-11T03:30:53  <simonstewart> Scrolling to the bottom suggests that it's trying to move something lower in the page than you expect into view

2011-08-11T03:31:49  <simonstewart> Does the link split over the end of a line?

2011-08-11T03:44:09  <simonstewart> I've been waiting for that question
2011-08-11T03:44:12  <jarib> :)
2011-08-11T03:44:28  <simonstewart> We may need to end up making some changes to the wire protocol to support that
2011-08-11T03:44:57  *** davehunt_ is now known as davehunt
2011-08-11T03:45:09  <jarib> hmm
2011-08-11T03:45:10  <jarib> ok
2011-08-11T03:45:27  <simonstewart> The problem we face is that we're using "sendKeys" to set the value of a file input element
2011-08-11T03:45:35  <simonstewart> which made sense Back In The Day
2011-08-11T03:45:44  <jarib> yep
2011-08-11T03:45:59  <simonstewart> But now we need to do "something else"
2011-08-11T03:46:16  <simonstewart> The first step will be a "file upload" API, which we won't expose to users
2011-08-11T03:46:31  <simonstewart> And then.... profit!
2011-08-11T03:47:34  *** nitin_ has quit IRC

2011-08-11T03:48:57  <jarib> just need to find out how the element actually works... the value property seems to point to the first file

2011-08-11T03:54:49  <simonstewart> I don't think that's fair on anyone
2011-08-11T03:55:09  <freynaud> if some other googlers want to attend, they should register, otherwise they will have to queue at security to have their badge done
2011-08-11T03:56:06  <simonstewart> I'll let people know
2011-08-11T03:56:29  <freynaud> thx.
2011-08-11T03:57:02  <jarib> the 'files' property is readonly though
2011-08-11T03:57:26  <jarib> and mozSetFileNameArray gives a SecurityError (from firebug)
2011-08-11T03:57:47  <jarib> so probably no simple execute_script workaround for this..
2011-08-11T03:58:26  <simonstewart> We'll figure it out
2011-08-11T03:58:44  <simonstewart> Knowing what the user facing API will be is the most important thing
2011-08-11T03:58:52  <simonstewart> Everything else can be made to flow from that
2011-08-11T03:58:53  <jarib> i believe we will, but i could use a temp workaround

2011-08-11T06:18:35  <Parabola> forgive me i maybe missing it, but findElement(By.id/name/linktext..ect).click();
2011-08-11T06:18:38  <Parabola> would be how i'd do it
2011-08-11T06:18:40  <Parabola> xpath is slower

2011-08-11T06:19:00  <Parabola> i try to avoid xpath whenever i can
2011-08-11T06:19:05  <Parabola> someone he recommended ti
2011-08-11T06:19:59  <simonstewart> Hmmm... that click test fails with synthesized events on windows
2011-08-11T06:20:07  <lord1234> the code for that element is: "<button class="ui-multiselect ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all flr mr8" type="button" _title="engines" aria-haspopup="true" style="width: 140px;">"
2011-08-11T06:20:34  <ebass> lord1234 you should always try to use css
2011-08-11T06:20:46  <lord1234> that class is not unique.
2011-08-11T06:20:54  <ebass> that way if u ever want to run tests in IE
2011-08-11T06:20:56  <lord1234> the _title is.
2011-08-11T06:20:58  <ebass> they wont be slooooow.
2011-08-11T06:21:09  <ebass> give it an id
2011-08-11T06:21:24  <simonstewart> You could find all the buttons by tag name and iterate over them looking at the _title attribute
2011-08-11T06:21:30  <simonstewart> I bet that there aren't that many buttons
2011-08-11T06:21:34  <lord1234> there are ~10
2011-08-11T06:21:54  <simonstewart> You could even do the "iterate and find" in a single chunk of JS
2011-08-11T06:22:00  <simonstewart> So you'd have two calls to the browser

2011-08-11T06:54:03  <Parabola> and restarting the VM didnt fix ti
2011-08-11T06:54:06  <ebass> yea, i remember that conversation from yesterday.
2011-08-11T06:54:10  <Parabola> yup
2011-08-11T06:54:20  <Parabola> i updated the issue with some notes of things i've tried or verified
2011-08-11T06:54:29  <Parabola> but i have not figured this otu yet, its really proving to make my job impossible
2011-08-11T06:54:55  *** dave_miles has quit IRC
2011-08-11T06:55:03  <ebass> whats the command line you use to start both your hub and the node
2011-08-11T06:55:36  *** cson has joined #selenium
2011-08-11T06:56:21  <Parabola> alright, so now its really not making sense
2011-08-11T06:56:30  <Parabola> if i have the tests use the FF node, and i have an IE window open
2011-08-11T06:56:40  <Parabola> the FF ones work fine with no ctrl+c
2011-08-11T06:57:30  <Parabola> gimmie a sec, i might have figured out my issue
2011-08-11T06:58:05  <Parabola> nope, sure didnt, i thought when the console was the active window it was not working, FF tests are working great now,
2011-08-11T06:58:46  <lord1234> what does ctrl+c do in the console?
2011-08-11T06:58:50  <lord1234> other then standard "break" functionality?
2011-08-11T06:58:55  <Parabola> thats all it does
2011-08-11T06:58:57  <lord1234> is there some other process running that might be blocking?
2011-08-11T06:58:58  *** angshu has quit IRC
2011-08-11T06:59:05  <Parabola> and for the last 12 hours it was the only way to make the tests run
2011-08-11T06:59:12  <Parabola> but i kid you not, now they are fine, IE and FF
2011-08-11T07:00:13  <Parabola> ebass: should i leave my issue open since it was real for the last day?
2011-08-11T07:00:26  <Parabola> i didnt do any os or app/config changes in either case
2011-08-11T07:00:29  <Parabola> working to broke to working
2011-08-11T07:00:49  <lord1234> what changed?
2011-08-11T07:01:26  <ebass> interesting
2011-08-11T07:01:39  <ebass> close the grid console :-D
2011-08-11T07:01:41  <lord1234> BTW:  this is how i fixed it:  https://gist.github.com/c8cffbc30d4072a6f576
2011-08-11T07:02:14  <ebass> yea
2011-08-11T07:02:25  <ebass> i was going to say it sounds like selenium was too fast for you UI leo

2011-08-11T07:03:33  <Parabola> haha
2011-08-11T07:03:45  <Parabola> lord1234: in my case? i didnt change i thing
2011-08-11T07:03:48  <Parabola> i went to pee, came back and tried again
2011-08-11T07:03:51  <Parabola> and they just launched
2011-08-11T07:03:55  <Parabola> maybe thats the key. urination
2011-08-11T07:03:55  <ebass> Parabola: the only thing thats different is that you opened the grid console page
2011-08-11T07:03:56  <ebass> hahah
2011-08-11T07:04:20  <ebass> Parabola: start drinking at least 16 cups of water per day.

2011-08-11T07:04:44  <ebass> if you water the grid it will flourish...

2011-08-11T07:25:52  <lord1234> if given a chance to move to a startup right now...would you?  considering the current economic situation?
2011-08-11T07:25:58  <simonstewart> "when a browser loves a standards body very much, they have a special...."

2011-08-11T07:26:26  <simonstewart> I'd not move, but that's mainly because I can do what I feel I need to do here at google
2011-08-11T07:26:39  <lord1234> simonstewart: lets say, that you were a bit unhappy where you currently were
2011-08-11T07:26:44  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: if a startup is successful during a recession they will boom even more when there is a boom
2011-08-11T07:26:51  <Parabola> simonstewart:  you work for google?
2011-08-11T07:26:55  <lord1234> they made 20M last year(first year of existence)

2011-08-11T07:27:53  <jimevans> there are a number of googlers who are in here frequently. simonstewart, eranm, jleyba, dawagner, just to name a few.

2011-08-11T07:28:06  <Parabola> thats cool

2011-08-11T07:28:47  <Parabola> its alot easier to put in that extra mile when you believe in what you're doing

2011-08-11T07:29:54  <Parabola> i have no idea
2011-08-11T07:29:58  <lord1234> i honestly have NO contacts in the industry, and haev no idea how to even get started
2011-08-11T07:30:10  <Parabola> lord1234: networking is super important
2011-08-11T07:30:10  <simonstewart> Geek nights
2011-08-11T07:30:13  <eranm> lord1234, regarding start-ups, I recommend reading "Crossing The Chasm" just to know what to expect, even if you're not in any marketing role.
2011-08-11T07:30:23  <lord1234> i've been in a LOT of startups so thats not the problem
2011-08-11T07:30:52  <AJAY____> anyway i am not happy with myself only one or two patches going for this release
2011-08-11T07:31:00  <lord1234> i'm just wondering if is houdl stay at established 50k person company where I am a tiny peon and very few people ntoice, or in a 20 person company where I'd be a much more noticeable individual
2011-08-11T07:31:21  <wilhelm> lord1234: Do good work. Preferrably in public. People will notice.
2011-08-11T07:31:23  <AutomatedTester> lord1234: where abouts do you live?

2011-08-11T07:31:51  <sproaty> hi, I'm running jUnit4 selenium tests - a firefox window is opened, but nothing happens to it (guessing it's to do with the 'waiting for window' debug message) --- http://paste.pocoo.org/show/456638/
2011-08-11T07:31:54  <Parabola> lord1234: only way to get noticed is to do stand out
2011-08-11T07:32:09  <Parabola> lord1234: standing out gets you noticed, just make sure you do damn good work if you're gonna stand out
2011-08-11T07:32:16  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: simonstewart : http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1296399
2011-08-11T07:32:22  <Parabola> because subpar or average work and standing out wont get you far
2011-08-11T07:32:23  <AutomatedTester> i forgot to paste that earlier
2011-08-11T07:32:50  <Parabola> i've also found that, ask for forgiveness rather than permission can work out well
2011-08-11T07:32:52  <Parabola> but its a gamble
2011-08-11T07:32:56  <lord1234> Parabola: i think I do good work, and i've never gotten a (valid) complaint, and I do stand out...and I wonder if good is "good enough".

2011-08-11T07:33:32  <AutomatedTester> hmm, when did that change

2011-08-11T07:36:51  <Parabola> hey guys, I know this is outside of the realm of this channel, but i'm new to java, and programming (i'm just a stupid sys admin :) )
2011-08-11T07:36:59  <lord1234> i've only ever met one QA contractor, and what I remember of him, he did crappy quality work.
2011-08-11T07:37:10  <AutomatedTester> nirvdrum is in Boston, when he comes on line, maybe ask which User Groups he goes to
2011-08-11T07:37:12  <Parabola> would anyone be willing to help me by taking a quick look at how i'm doing these tests? i think i'm doing them very inefficently

2011-08-11T07:37:48  <Parabola> and its just kinda "dirty"
2011-08-11T07:37:50  <sproaty> hmm, starting selenium server from the command line still launches firefox once I execute my junit test but no commands are sent to it
2011-08-11T07:37:58  <cson> lord1234: I work in Boston too and I know most orgs that use selenium just create robot type tests (no page objects, abstraction, etc.).  However engineering management doesn't care as long as it catches something.
2011-08-11T07:38:05  <Parabola> sproaty: you using java?
2011-08-11T07:38:09  <sproaty> yes
2011-08-11T07:38:15  <Parabola> any errors?
2011-08-11T07:38:25  <sproaty> nope - here's my test and some output: com.springsource.org.openqa.selenium.server.jar

2011-08-11T07:39:08  <lord1234> does it have proper permissions on the profile folder?
2011-08-11T07:39:23  <sproaty> lord1234, "it"?
2011-08-11T07:39:39  <Parabola> sproaty:  yeah
2011-08-11T07:39:46  <Parabola> are you using the builtin firefox?
2011-08-11T07:39:46  <lord1234> the FF profile
2011-08-11T07:39:54  <lord1234> your sytem does it have proper permissions
2011-08-11T07:39:59  <Parabola> I thought i heard the FF that ships with ubuntu wont work properly
2011-08-11T07:40:00  <sproaty> ah let me see
2011-08-11T07:40:06  <sproaty> yeah it is the default firefox
2011-08-11T07:40:11  <sproaty> Parabola, hmm. interesting

2011-08-11T07:45:37  <lord1234> Parabola: something like this

2011-08-11T07:45:53  <lord1234> not sure how to have it set the By.cssselector to equal By.selector_type but you ge tthe gist....
2011-08-11T07:46:24  <lord1234> thats a quick hack since I don't do Java.
2011-08-11T07:46:40  <Parabola> i understand
2011-08-11T07:46:53  <Parabola> so use arguments
2011-08-11T07:47:00  <lord1234> absolutely
2011-08-11T07:47:01  <Parabola> and have them passed in from somthing
2011-08-11T07:47:13  <lord1234> that way you can have the same function called ~10 times
2011-08-11T07:47:14  <Parabola> hmm
2011-08-11T07:47:18  <Parabola> I shall look into that
2011-08-11T07:47:18  <lord1234> but its significantly better
2011-08-11T07:48:55  <jimevans> IE9 (Windows 7) test_ie and emulation passes
2011-08-11T07:49:10  <Parabola> I'm having a hard time learning java, learning javascript has been a much much easier ride for me :)
2011-08-11T07:49:17  <lord1234> why did you pick java?
2011-08-11T07:49:25  <lord1234> (not a bad choice, but why?)
2011-08-11T07:49:28  <Parabola> my company uses it, and they paid for me to learn it
2011-08-11T07:49:38  <lord1234> not a bad reason.
2011-08-11T07:49:46  <Parabola> my boss wants me to be a hybrid sys admin / websphere admin / java developer
2011-08-11T07:49:54  <Parabola> I'm only 26, wouldnt be a bad skill set :)
2011-08-11T07:49:57  <lord1234> hope you can find 28 hours ina  24 hour day then....
2011-08-11T07:50:01  <lord1234> i'm 27.
2011-08-11T07:50:01  <Parabola> haha
2011-08-11T07:50:02  <simonstewart> OK. Tests went green on my mac
2011-08-11T07:50:04  <simonstewart> How's IE?
2011-08-11T07:50:17  <jimevans> simonstewart: IE9 (Windows 7) test_ie and emulation passes, running IE6 now.
2011-08-11T07:50:26  <simonstewart> Parabola: your boss sounds like he's dreaming
2011-08-11T07:50:29  <lord1234> my boss wants me to be Manual, Automation, L3 Support, Release Manager, Developer.
2011-08-11T07:50:35  <Parabola> simonstewart: its not like it sounds
2011-08-11T07:50:43  <Parabola> i wont be responsible for all of it
2011-08-11T07:50:54  <Parabola> I would be a dev, that could bridge the sys admin / dev communciation gap
2011-08-11T07:50:57  <Parabola> i agree with him too
2011-08-11T07:51:03  <lord1234> its part of the reason I am thinking of leaving here.
2011-08-11T07:51:04  <Parabola> developers are not generally technical people
2011-08-11T07:51:14  <lord1234> and i'm responsible for all of it except the dev thing
2011-08-11T07:51:29  <Parabola> i'm not pressured into anything, its nice
2011-08-11T07:51:31  <simonstewart> Parabola: find a devops community near you
2011-08-11T07:51:51  <lord1234> i wish there was a QAops community
2011-08-11T07:51:54  <Parabola> they leave me alone, i maintain the os's but its not really any work, linux and aix dont break :)
2011-08-11T07:51:56  <lord1234> QA peopel who wear a million hats.
2011-08-11T07:52:09  <Parabola> anyway, thats why i'm learning java
2011-08-11T07:52:23  <Parabola> and i'm also learning javascript, and i like it alot more
2011-08-11T07:52:29  <Parabola> its so much more natural to the way I think
2011-08-11T07:52:29  <simonstewart> The native firefox tests fail for me consistently on Linux, but otherwise things are looking good
2011-08-11T07:52:35  <lord1234> but selenium != javascript
2011-08-11T07:52:42  <Parabola> well not really
2011-08-11T07:52:48  <Parabola> i could juse javascript on rhino :)
2011-08-11T07:52:52  <simonstewart> Love a bit of JS in the morning

2011-08-11T07:53:27  <simonstewart> Can you run that in test_single?
2011-08-11T07:53:27  <Parabola> no need for if / else if over and over hehe
2011-08-11T07:53:42  <Parabola> or give java short circuit operators
2011-08-11T07:53:58  <lord1234> Parabola: ruby allows that kind of stuff
2011-08-11T07:54:07  <Parabola> this is true

2011-08-11T08:13:05  <Parabola> so i threw the new if statement within the block for the if, so the closing bracket for the 2nd if is right above the first If's closing bracket

2011-08-11T08:28:59  <Galaxor> Hi.  I'm trying to verify that, in column 1 of a certain table, none of the text has non-numeric characters.  I was hoping to use a regex for this, but I don't think there's a native way, so I'm trying to use verifyEval, and writing some javascript to do it.  It would be easy if jquery were available, but I find I'm having to write difficult-to-maintain 2001-style javascript to find the nodes I'm looking for.  Is there a better way?
2011-08-11T08:31:09  <Galaxor> browserbot.findElement will only return one element.  Otherwise, I'd put an xpath in there and get a list of things that matched and iterate over them.
2011-08-11T08:31:24  <lord1234> findElements?
2011-08-11T08:31:35  <lord1234> that returns more then 1 element?

2011-08-11T09:13:24  <Galaxor> Okay, I don't understand how to use verifyEval.  I've got a variable, ret_val, that I'm setting to true or false in the correct situations.  I can't use return ret_val; that throws an exception.  I tried just having ret_val; be the last statement of my verifyEval, but the test shows up red even though alert(ret_val) shows true.
2011-08-11T09:13:31  <XRayCulver> https://gist.github.com/1140080 how would i get the text after the span in a selector?
2011-08-11T09:13:37  <jimevans> It's possible too that we're dealing with a resolution thing. Clicking at the center of the body element may not click in the same place on all resolutions.
2011-08-11T09:14:02  <jimevans> XRayCulver: a css selector? you don't

2011-08-11T10:12:56  <RossPatterson> zizazz__: Here's my standard response to the selenium-users list:
2011-08-11T10:12:58  <RossPatterson> The publicly-available free Selenium information on the Internet is spotty at best.  There are lots of blog posts, but nothing that presents a coherent discussion or in-depth tutorial.  Both David Burns Selenium 1.0 Testing Tools: Beginners Guide ((https://www.packtpub.com/selenium-1-0-testing-tools-beginners-guide/book) and Alan  Richardsons Selenium Simplified - Automated Web Testing with Java and Selenium RC (http://ww
2011-08-11T10:12:58  <RossPatterson> w.lulu.com/product/paperback/selenium-simplified/14939945) are great beginners books for Selenium and a great deal .  Both are available in paperback and as e-books.  If you want to peek at them, both authors or their publishers offer partial downloads for free (David: https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/0264OS-Chapter-6-First-Steps-with-Selenium-RC.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&utm_medium=free&utm_campaign=pdf; Alan: https:

2011-08-11T10:12:58  <RossPatterson> Highly recommended.

2011-08-11T11:01:54  <RossPatterson> lord1234: You've got <LI CLASS="... studies-tab-selected ..." ...>.  So you can do "xpath=//li/[contains(@class, 'studies-tab-selected')]", or "css=li.studies-tab-selected", or even better, "css=.studies-tab-selected".
2011-08-11T11:02:16  <lord1234> instead of :class?
2011-08-11T11:02:17  <selbot2> http://goo.gl/qC50R
2011-08-11T11:02:21  <RossPatterson> Note that CSS does a better job of handling the multi-valued CLASS attribute than XPATH does.
2011-08-11T11:03:01  <RossPatterson> jarib: I think selbot is being overly agressive about ":class" -> ":cla".

2011-08-11T11:03:57  <RossPatterson> Ahh ... yo no hablo Ruby.
2011-08-11T11:05:15  <lord1234> lol
2011-08-11T11:05:17  <lord1234> s'ok
2011-08-11T11:07:33  <lord1234> how about an xpath question:  given multiple elements <a class=test>  how would you reference elementX?  //a[@class='test'][X]?
2011-08-11T11:08:32  <RossPatterson> Almost.  "xpath=(//a[@class='test'])[X]".  Note the placement of the parens - it matters.  Also, X starts counting at 1, not 0.

2011-08-11T11:22:07  <lord1234> so i have an element //div[@class=compet_url]  In fact there are multiple elements this way...any way to search for it By.class as opposed to By.xpath?

2011-08-11T11:31:32  <lukeis> div.compet_url

2011-08-11T14:56:54  <jarib> not really my area of expertise, but perhaps look at http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#c
2011-08-11T14:57:27  <jarib> though i believe that to be a little outdated (e.g. we have nuget packages now)
2011-08-11T14:58:35  <emil_temp_nick> i have already download and unzipped, not sure how to setup
2011-08-11T14:59:22  <jarib> sounds like you need to add a reference to the dlls in your Visual Studio project?
2011-08-11T14:59:49  <emil_temp_nick> can't find any docs
2011-08-11T15:00:23  <emil_temp_nick> is there anything else needed for scripting and running?
2011-08-11T15:00:44  <jarib> i'm pretty sure Visual Studio is quite well documented :)
2011-08-11T15:01:20  <jarib> that depends on what you mean by "scripting and running", but you shouldn't need to download anything else to get started, that's correct
2011-08-11T15:01:50  <emil_temp_nick> i meant docs for webdriver
2011-08-11T15:02:25  <emil_temp_nick> do u know if i also need Nunit?

2011-08-11T15:21:15  <Glavata> do I need any orther jars to use FirefoxDriver in my project class path other than selenium-java-2.3.0.jar ?
2011-08-11T15:28:44  <jarib> Glavata: yes. selenium depends on some third party libraries, which you'll find in the libs/ directory from selenium-java-2.3.0.zip
2011-08-11T15:29:10  <jarib> Glavata: if you want everything packaged as a single jar, get selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar

2011-08-11T19:35:45  <djdevin> how the hell do i use selenium grid
2011-08-11T19:35:52  <djdevin> is that a loaded question

2011-08-11T19:39:47  <djdevin> i'm at "Using grid to run tests"
2011-08-11T19:40:08  <djdevin> i have nodes connected, but i get ERROR: Connection refused. for every test
2011-08-11T19:42:18  <Binken_> Try to see your port is used by any other application
2011-08-11T19:42:48  <djdevin> well - i can connect to the RC just fine
2011-08-11T19:44:14  <djdevin> listing out "Available Remote Controls"
2011-08-11T19:44:56  <Binken_> you use the same port for the RC?
2011-08-11T19:47:48  <djdevin> rc is running on 5555...Available remote controls says
2011-08-11T19:47:51  <djdevin> 216.119.145.80	54360	/SE2/
2011-08-11T19:47:53  <djdevin> for example
2011-08-11T19:56:14  <djdevin> Binken_: unrelated issue. RC client is starting, but the selenium server itself on the node has java errors
2011-08-11T19:56:17  <djdevin> thanks for your time
