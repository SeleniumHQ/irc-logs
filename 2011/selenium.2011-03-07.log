2011-03-07T08:52:30  <andytinkham> Is there a way to take a screenshot with Se2 in Ruby? I've found the Java and C# methods, but they both refer to a GetScreenshot method in the driver, which unless I'm being extremely blind, doesn't seem to exist in the Ruby driver object.
2011-03-07T08:53:22  <andytinkham> Ah, I think I found the equivalent

2011-03-07T12:05:32  <rethus> hi.
2011-03-07T12:06:15  <rethus> i have some layers <div id=content123> ..id=content 124 .. id=content125 and so on
2011-03-07T12:06:41  <rethus> inside of those divs are images which have an onclick-event which opens a external link.
2011-03-07T12:06:59  <rethus> how can i check each of those links wit selenium?
2011-03-07T12:07:04  <rethus> means click them
2011-03-07T12:08:18  <adamgoucher> click('//div[@id='content123'])/img or click('css=#content123 img') is how i would start
2011-03-07T12:08:37  <rethus> in pseudocode i mean this:
2011-03-07T12:08:37  <rethus> if id=content* > first.div.image.onclick = click
2011-03-07T12:09:01  <rethus> ah, ok, but the problem is, i didn't know exactly the numbers behind id=content
2011-03-07T12:09:10  <rethus> thats random-numbers
2011-03-07T12:09:49  <adamgoucher> if you need to click each, then it doesnt matter. get a count using getXpathCount or getCssCount and then inject the index into the locator
2011-03-07T12:10:47  <rethus> k. thanks. can u give me a link about an example. i'm newbe since 10 Minutes on selenium

2011-03-07T12:34:17  <adamvandenhoven> are there any plans to get the selenium IDE working with the latest FF4 beta? version 1.0.9 suggests it works with b7 but we onto FF4b12
2011-03-07T12:34:28  <adamvandenhoven> or what silly little thing can I change to make it work?
2011-03-07T12:34:42  <adamvandenhoven> assuming its just a version number issue and not a functional issue
2011-03-07T12:34:58  <adamgoucher> adamvandenhoven: ya; just a version thing
2011-03-07T12:35:35  <adamvandenhoven> so open the xpi in textmate and root around for something that looks versiony?

2011-03-07T23:33:50  <|izzie> Java Client Driver Configuration¶
2011-03-07T23:33:50  <|izzie> In General configuration of Selenium-RC with any java IDE would have following steps:
2011-03-07T23:33:50  <|izzie>     * Download Selenium-RC from the SeleniumHQ downloads page
2011-03-07T23:33:50  <|izzie>     * Start any java IDE
2011-03-07T23:33:50  <|izzie>     * Create new project
2011-03-07T23:33:51  <|izzie>     * Add to your project classpath selenium-java-client-driver.jar
2011-03-07T23:34:06  <|izzie> where does one FIND this selenium-java-client-driver.jar?
