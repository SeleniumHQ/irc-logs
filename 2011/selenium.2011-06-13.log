2011-06-13T02:00:18  <Zladivliba> hi everyone !
2011-06-13T02:01:27  <Zladivliba> I'm trying to fetch the content of a MultiSelect who's embedded inside a DropDown button written in dojo. It seems there's no way to open the button, I have no idea why (I've tried dozens of possibilities). Could anyone help me a little ?
2011-06-13T02:01:35  <Zladivliba> here's some code : http://jsfiddle.net/zladivliba/p5fqR/6/
2011-06-13T02:02:13  <Zladivliba> my test consists of simply clicking on the button and selecting option no2 and save it
2011-06-13T02:08:26  <jarib> Zladivliba: it would be easier to help if you created an actual page that demonstrates the problem
2011-06-13T02:10:16  <jarib> Zladivliba: if i want to help you know, i'd have to paste those snippets into a file, figure out where to load dojo, and then guess about what your test script might be doing

If you remember, you told me about modifiying Selenium-api.js to remove the alert code so that, I do not get stuck at detecting an onLoad alert and pressing "ok". I can supress them visibly by using window.alert=null; but can I execute this with the help of selenium-bot.js whenever it comes across an alert?
2011-06-13T02:20:58  <jarib> Zladivliba: try clicking the element with id='dijit_form_DropDownButton_0_label' instead

2011-06-13T02:23:24  <Zladivliba> jarib, no unfortunately it doesn't work
2011-06-13T02:23:40  <Zladivliba> $this->selenium->click("id='dijit_form_DropDownButton_0_label'"); doesn't open the drop down
2011-06-13T02:25:00  <Zladivliba> I don't think that the problem is related to the locator
2011-06-13T02:25:28  <Zladivliba> I think the click action doesn't work in this case

2011-06-13T02:26:05  <Zladivliba> maybe I could launch the open event with this

2011-06-13T02:53:30  <AutomatedTester> Zladivliba: you can access webdriver on the Selenium Server
2011-06-13T02:53:52  <AutomatedTester> it uses the RemoteWebDriver
2011-06-13T02:53:56  <AutomatedTester> but the API is the same
2011-06-13T02:55:46  <Zladivliba> AutomatedTester,  I currently use php for my tests. It happens that one test failed and jarib showed me how to build a test that works, however  his code uses webdriver (https://gist.github.com/1022526). How can I integrate this test with php ?
2011-06-13T02:56:03  <Zladivliba> like "driver.find_element"

2011-06-13T03:36:37  <jarib> and 'src' on <script>
2011-06-13T03:38:19  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: Any idea how can I execute JavaScript with selenese HTML? wherever I add the JS it gets executed at the begingn of the tests.
2011-06-13T03:38:59  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: what are you trying to do?
2011-06-13T03:40:59  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: I have an Iframe inside a page, where actually the SCORM content is played. So any alerts from within the frame cannot be visilbly suppressed by window.alert = null;. So If I can try and inject this code in the IFrame, I might succeed?
2011-06-13T03:41:23  <AutomatedTester> what are you trying to do with Selenese HTML?
2011-06-13T03:41:35  <Mayank_134> I have the tests in the HTML table format
2011-06-13T03:42:09  <AutomatedTester> ok, so JS is executed by the browser when it finds it
2011-06-13T03:42:31  <AutomatedTester> so you need to wrap it so the browser doesnt know that it should be executed
2011-06-13T03:42:58  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: I think you're life would be much simpler if you werent using the OLD format

2011-06-13T03:43:42  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: not commenting it
2011-06-13T03:43:54  <AutomatedTester> making it a JS object and then calling it
2011-06-13T03:44:48  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: Well, I thought using the HTML format would have been possibly the easiest. But now I am learning that webdriver API's have webdriver.switchTo.Alert() :(
2011-06-13T03:45:16  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: even in webdriver onLoad alerts may lock the test
2011-06-13T03:45:35  <AutomatedTester> since get() is a blocking call
2011-06-13T03:45:54  <AutomatedTester> so you could get into some nastiness
2011-06-13T03:46:00  <Mayank_134> Well I could comment that in selenium-alert.js
2011-06-13T03:46:08  <Mayank_134> sorry selenium-api.js
2011-06-13T03:46:44  <barancev> what should return webdriver if an attribute is not defined?
2011-06-13T03:46:51  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: but can I achieve the same thing in the HTML format, with commenting on the get() ?
2011-06-13T03:47:34  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: no because get() and the selenium code dont really share anything
2011-06-13T03:47:53  <barancev> it seems to me that HtmlUnitWebElement.getAttribute is incorrect in several ways :)
2011-06-13T03:48:12  <AutomatedTester> barancev: off the top of my head it should return Null

2011-06-13T03:49:48  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: I did not get that much, but would you mentioned about - me making my life simpler by using the NEW format. Which format should switch to, if I have to get away with this blocking?
2011-06-13T03:50:08  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: stop using the HTML format

2011-06-13T03:52:03  <AutomatedTester> Mayank_134: pick a supported language and write tests in that format
2011-06-13T03:52:15  <AutomatedTester> like Python, .NET, Java, Ruby

2011-06-13T03:54:04  <AutomatedTester> hey Grouchy :P
2011-06-13T03:54:11  <adamgoucher> heh
2011-06-13T03:54:24  <rstrazhnyk1> hello
2011-06-13T03:54:47  <adamgoucher> so, i tried to switch from nose -> py.test on the weekend and got burned by the same aggressive discovery that you logged a bug about :P
2011-06-13T03:55:19  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: yea, they say its working as intended
2011-06-13T03:55:29  <AutomatedTester> and I laughed at them
2011-06-13T03:55:45  <Mayank_134> AutomatedTester: aahh!! I already have more than half of my tests writtenn in HTML format, probably  I could convert them using the Selenium IDE. But as you said that *might* not solve the problem either? There is probably no way that HTML format work? any that you can think of?
2011-06-13T03:55:47  <barancev> jarib: there are no tests for attributes in upper case, there are no tests for links that are not valid (and can raise MalformedURLException)
2011-06-13T03:56:06  <adamgoucher> we need a -m foo which only uses the MarkInfo objects rather than the names
2011-06-13T03:56:20  <AutomatedTester> ffs Google code is shit today!!!
2011-06-13T03:56:28  <adamgoucher> -k a essential does .*a.* which is dumb dumb dumb
2011-06-13T03:56:55  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if I had time I would fix
2011-06-13T03:56:58  <barancev> how to convert illegal short relative url to the absolute one?
2011-06-13T03:57:38  <barancev> should a driver return null or "something looking like an URL, but invalid"?
2011-06-13T03:57:55  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: ya. i might go down that rabbit hole this week. looking at doing something like @pytest.marks('foo', 'bar') which would create MarkInfo's for each
2011-06-13T03:57:56  <jarib> barancev: example?
2011-06-13T03:58:20  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: i know davehunt would appreciate it
2011-06-13T03:58:33  <barancev> <a href="http://<script>"></a> -- FF returns http://<script>/
2011-06-13T03:58:34  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if/when you do, we can pair and get it done
2011-06-13T03:59:01  <jarib> barancev: that seems sane
2011-06-13T04:00:51  <rstrazhnyk1> adamgoucher: Hi, David says you're also keen to have webdriver python bindings with selenium1 emulation, so now if I use selenium = DrivenSelenium(browser, url) and then selenium.is_text_present("something") i get File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/selenium/selenium.py", line 1360, in is_text_present

2011-06-13T04:02:06  <barancev> rstrazhnyk1: use pastebin!
2011-06-13T04:02:24  <adamgoucher> i havent played with it as i was/am led to believe its not working
2011-06-13T04:03:04  <jarib> barancev: as does chrome.
2011-06-13T04:03:36  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: firstly, please put things like that in a pastebin
2011-06-13T04:03:50  <barancev> chrome atm just returns untouched value of the attribute
2011-06-13T04:03:52  <barancev> http://<script>
2011-06-13T04:04:12  <barancev> all three are different
2011-06-13T04:04:31  <rstrazhnyk1> AutomatedTester, sorry, forgot about it
2011-06-13T04:04:32  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: so the minor implementation is not tested
2011-06-13T04:04:57  <jarib> barancev: are you talking about chrome the browser or chrome the driver?
2011-06-13T04:05:11  <AutomatedTester> the only thing that is really working is the navigation part
2011-06-13T04:05:34  <barancev> I'm watching what selenium returns, so -- the driver, I think
2011-06-13T04:05:53  *** cheezy has quit IRC
2011-06-13T04:06:05  <jarib> barancev: ok. so the chrome driver, once the atoms are in sync with firefox, will return "http://%3Cscript%3E/"
2011-06-13T04:07:35  <rstrazhnyk1> http://pastebin.com/vFCrLtjY pasted that
2011-06-13T04:08:03  <jarib> barancev: http://files.jaribakken.com/tmp/chrome.png
2011-06-13T04:08:18  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: so the current emulation only really does navigation
2011-06-13T04:08:54  <rstrazhnyk1> AutomatedTester: that's also good) but you mean only for python, or for whatever ?
2011-06-13T04:09:05  <AutomatedTester> for python
2011-06-13T04:09:10  <rstrazhnyk1> i see
2011-06-13T04:09:25  <AutomatedTester> if its not implemented, it defaults to the normal Selenium command
2011-06-13T04:09:42  <barancev> jarib: ok, I'll try to make HtmlUnitDriver consistant with IE, but FF behavior is different for angles < and >
2011-06-13T04:09:51  <AutomatedTester> and why I said I am waiting for Simon to finish the server side implementation
2011-06-13T04:10:11  <rstrazhnyk1> AutomatedTester, so we will see it very soon
2011-06-13T04:10:30  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: as soon as Simon has free time
2011-06-13T04:10:37  <AutomatedTester> but patches are more than welcome
2011-06-13T04:11:25  <rstrazhnyk1> AutomatedTester, i haven't looked deeply to the implementation itself, but it's great even as working as it is now
2011-06-13T04:11:54  <rstrazhnyk1> and selenium2 standalone version is great
2011-06-13T04:11:57  <jarib> barancev: yeah, i don't think having perfect consistency for invalid URLs is super important
2011-06-13T04:13:05  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: I havent been jumping up and down about the Se1 emulation in Se2 because not many people has asked for it tbh
2011-06-13T04:13:09  *** jksM has left #selenium
2011-06-13T04:13:33  <AutomatedTester> in the python community
2011-06-13T04:15:13  <rstrazhnyk1> AutomatedTester, but generally what I am wondering, that if switch to Se2 on python, will I have at least the same functionality to operate. Does it covers all off Se1 , but in a little different way?
2011-06-13T04:15:38  <AutomatedTester> rstrazhnyk1: yea
2011-06-13T04:15:57  <rstrazhnyk1> if it is so no problem and maybe I don't need emulation at all
2011-06-13T04:16:42  <rstrazhnyk1> it's more needed to the old projects where people need to change the whole code parts
2011-06-13T04:17:06  <rstrazhnyk1> anyway, thanks David

2011-06-13T04:37:23  <Zladivliba> also one thing really wierd, I tried to run some js from selenium. Well this works : dijit.registry.byClass(\"dgets.Community\").forEach(function(widget){widget.openRecipients();}); when I execute it inside a console (it opens my box), however the same exact line, doesn't work  when I use it using getEval
2011-06-13T04:37:32  <Zladivliba> strange, strange, strange
2011-06-13T04:40:15  <Zladivliba> ah, ok I finally got it working using runScript !
2011-06-13T04:40:19  <Zladivliba> great !
2011-06-13T04:40:41  <barancev> jarib: what ià href="" (empty sting)?
2011-06-13T04:41:02  <barancev> ah, I'll ask IE :)
2011-06-13T04:42:57  <jarib> barancev: probably return ""
2011-06-13T04:43:25  <barancev> jarib: "" is not an absolute url
2011-06-13T04:43:30  <barancev> hmm.. my hope was that is should be the address of the current page
2011-06-13T04:43:36  <barancev> FF returns empty string
2011-06-13T04:43:37  <jarib> "" is not a relative url either
2011-06-13T04:44:02  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T04:44:12  <barancev> IE returns http://localhost/ instead of http://localhost/links.html (where this href was)
2011-06-13T04:44:32  <jarib> hmm
2011-06-13T04:45:34  <jarib> hmpf
2011-06-13T04:46:08  <barancev> jarib: actually, it is how browsers behave -- FF doesn't follow sucha a link, IE goes to the directory
2011-06-13T04:46:13  <jarib> chrome will return the current url
2011-06-13T04:46:55  <jarib> and just reloads the page if followed
2011-06-13T04:47:12  <jarib> fun.
2011-06-13T04:48:16  <barancev> FF follows and reload the page, but too fast (firebug says it sends request)
2011-06-13T04:48:35  <barancev> Opera, FF, Chrome are on one side, IE on the other
2011-06-13T04:49:18  <barancev> in this case we can't transform, because browser behavior differs

2011-06-13T05:29:57  <simonstewart> ok
2011-06-13T05:30:14  <freynaud> simonstewart: do I start both the start that create the clean profile AND the normal ff start with that
2011-06-13T05:30:19  <freynaud> or only the second one
2011-06-13T05:30:34  <simonstewart> Let's take a look at the source....
2011-06-13T05:30:44  <simonstewart> just the second by the look of it
2011-06-13T05:30:48  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: i say the second 1 because the first cleans the profile, starts and stops the browser
2011-06-13T05:30:54  <simonstewart> (clean and startProfile are different methods)
2011-06-13T05:30:54  <freynaud> what AutomatedTester said make sense.
2011-06-13T05:31:28  <freynaud> AutomatedTester: the only thing then is that you have to make sure that you start webdriver with a explort display valid
2011-06-13T05:31:44  <freynaud> otherwise even if you specify a proper diplsay for FF, the clean start will crash

2011-06-13T05:48:48  <freynaud> you want something earlier ? I think davehunt was free only ater July 1Ã©yth
2011-06-13T05:48:49  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: DaveHunt and I are in MV next week
2011-06-13T05:49:12  <simonstewart> We can always do the launch, organize the party and then use the SeLon for a show and tell
2011-06-13T05:49:24  <simonstewart> Should get a nice turnout for it
2011-06-13T05:50:06  <freynaud> simonstewart: i'll add you to the thread tomorrow when Davehunt comes back
2011-06-13T05:50:20  <simonstewart> And that release "plan" reckons on us not finding any truely blocking issues

2011-06-13T06:00:35  <jarib> the "determine state using is_selected" belongs on toggle

2011-06-13T06:03:09  <AutomatedTester> <- moron
2011-06-13T06:04:36  <XCulver> is there a wiki page for running the .net tests in the build?
2011-06-13T06:04:45  <simonstewart> ./go test_dotnet
2011-06-13T06:05:14  <XCulver> anything need to be done before that?
2011-06-13T06:05:28  <XCulver> besides svn update?
2011-06-13T06:05:36  <simonstewart> Not sure: it's been a long time since I set up a machine. That should be good to go
2011-06-13T06:05:54  <XCulver> ok, thanks
2011-06-13T06:06:06  <simonstewart> np
2011-06-13T06:06:11  <simonstewart> let me know if I'm wrong :)
2011-06-13T06:06:18  <XCulver> wont know till i get home tonight
2011-06-13T06:06:28  <jarib> AutomatedTester, simonstewart: or is it simon who swapped the messages?
2011-06-13T06:06:29  <XCulver> was looking at it this weekend a bit
2011-06-13T06:06:40  <jarib> toggle() is just an alias for click() anyway, right?
2011-06-13T06:06:45  <simonstewart> Sort of
2011-06-13T06:06:56  <simonstewart> It's got some logic in there for various edge cases
2011-06-13T06:07:06  <simonstewart> (like checking to see if the element actually is togglable)
2011-06-13T06:07:29  <jarib> but the "determine the state" hint sort of belongs on setSelected, no?
2011-06-13T06:07:31  <simonstewart> but, yeah, it's basically a "click"
2011-06-13T06:07:43  <simonstewart> when deprecating a method you tell people what to use instead
2011-06-13T06:07:43  <jarib> since toggle() never did that for you
2011-06-13T06:07:48  <jarib> but setSelected did
2011-06-13T06:08:10  <simonstewart> tbh, the comment could be on both methods

2011-06-13T06:13:53  <selbot2> jari.bakken less than 10 seconds ago - JariBakken: Deprecate Element#{toggle,select} in Ruby. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12465
2011-06-13T06:16:22  <jarib> simonstewart: how will click() work when you want to select multiple options?
2011-06-13T06:16:38  <simonstewart> good question
2011-06-13T06:16:49  <simonstewart> how would you expect it to work?
2011-06-13T06:17:04  <simonstewart> Do you expect us to hold the ctl key down and do a click?
2011-06-13T06:17:27  <jarib> no
2011-06-13T06:17:47  <simonstewart> some other form of magic?
2011-06-13T06:17:54  <jarib> but do we support shift-clicking cross-browser, like we do with select()?
2011-06-13T06:18:12  <simonstewart> shift clicking selects a range
2011-06-13T06:18:20  <jarib> or ctrl-clicking
2011-06-13T06:18:20  <simonstewart> ctl click is for individual elements
2011-06-13T06:18:24  <simonstewart> we should
2011-06-13T06:18:54  <jarib> ok? can we shift/ctrl-click on mac?
2011-06-13T06:19:09  <simonstewart> right now? Probably not
2011-06-13T06:19:10  <jarib> or do you mean "should" as in "eventually"
2011-06-13T06:19:19  <simonstewart> "eventually, if not now"
2011-06-13T06:19:33  <jarib> ok, so deprecating select() is more than just removing the method, we're actually losing functionality
2011-06-13T06:19:52  <simonstewart> which we should add before removing the method entirely
2011-06-13T06:20:06  <simonstewart> I don't want another hover debacle
2011-06-13T06:20:11  <jarib> right

2011-06-13T06:22:16  <jarib> but this will be close, people will look for alternatives when there is none
2011-06-13T06:22:26  *** Nirdosh has left #selenium
2011-06-13T06:22:42  <jarib> esp. in the dynamic languages where it's not just a compile-time warning but a runtime warning
2011-06-13T06:22:44  <simonstewart> In the Java world, we can push more functionality into the Select support class for now
2011-06-13T06:23:17  <simonstewart> I've no idea what the usage of "setSelected" on a multi-item select is outside of google, but here it's almost non-existant
2011-06-13T06:23:43  <jarib> pushing it to support doesn't help the fact that it's impossible to do without setSelected
2011-06-13T06:23:53  <simonstewart> I'm not disagreeing with you
2011-06-13T06:23:54  <jarib> unless you want the support class to magically invoke the old setSelected atoms
2011-06-13T06:24:11  <simonstewart> First step: let's push a failing test into the build
2011-06-13T06:24:16  <jarib> ok
2011-06-13T06:24:21  <simonstewart> Describing how we'd like to interact with the API
2011-06-13T06:24:31  <simonstewart> Then we make that test pass
2011-06-13T06:24:38  <simonstewart> Problem solved :)
2011-06-13T06:24:42  <jarib> hehe
2011-06-13T06:25:06  <simonstewart> What should we call the character that allows "single selecting"?
2011-06-13T06:25:22  <jarib> though, doesn't the test come down to "would like native events to work everywhere"? that's not too useful
2011-06-13T06:25:23  <simonstewart> On Linux and Windows, it's CTL, on OS X it's COMMAND
2011-06-13T06:25:31  <jarib> hmm
2011-06-13T06:25:49  <simonstewart> Let's write what we'd like
2011-06-13T06:25:53  <simonstewart> then make it work
2011-06-13T06:25:55  <simonstewart> without native events
2011-06-13T06:26:06  <jarib> ok
2011-06-13T06:26:06  <simonstewart> Keys.SINGLE_SELECT?
2011-06-13T06:26:24  <simonstewart> Keys.INDIVIDUAL_SELECT?
2011-06-13T06:26:43  <jarib> Keys.ADD_SELECT ?
2011-06-13T06:26:57  <simonstewart> You can click on a selected element again to deselect it
2011-06-13T06:27:05  <jarib> right
2011-06-13T06:27:15  <adamgoucher> single is less keys to type, so i vote for that
2011-06-13T06:27:21  <simonstewart> Ha!

2011-06-13T06:38:27  <jimevans> technically, 'android' should work too, but that requires some extra work setting up an emulator.
2011-06-13T06:38:56  <XCulver> nothing else needs to be setup?

2011-06-13T06:39:20  <AutomatedTester> feeling better?
2011-06-13T06:39:25  <jimevans> the .net tests need the same test webserver that the java tests use.
2011-06-13T06:39:35  <jimevans> (and the build process builds it)
2011-06-13T06:39:55  <XCulver> so if i host it w/ iis express in vs2010 i should be gtg?

2011-06-13T06:41:23  <jimevans> they're handled in the java web server via jetty servlets

2011-06-13T06:53:13  <rstrazhnyk1> but you are deprecating select
2011-06-13T06:53:20  <rstrazhnyk1> or only toggle?

2011-06-13T08:01:05  <AutomatedTester> htf can you test when you dont know what you want?
2011-06-13T08:01:46  <simonstewart> apparently all attributes are dynamically generated. Presumably he'll know what he's looking for when he sees it
2011-06-13T08:02:00  <adamgoucher> i suspect what he has to deal with are randomly generated ids, but there is a pattern. so he would have things like *monkey to click things
2011-06-13T08:02:15  <jimevans> to be fair, i can sort-of see the point. if you know the attribute you want always starts with, say, "foo", then his suggestion would work
2011-06-13T08:02:21  <AutomatedTester> no, he wants attributes that are randomly generated
2011-06-13T08:02:31  <jimevans> ^^ adamgoucher beat me to it.
2011-06-13T08:02:40  <AutomatedTester> so thats assuming the browser can deal with it

2011-06-13T08:05:26  <simonstewart> If it's the value of the ID that changes, he still knows that he's looking for the "id" attribute

2011-06-13T08:28:54  <rpk> On Se2 Grid: If I have multiple test cases in a testsuite, and send the test suite to the hub, will the cases run in parallel?
2011-06-13T08:29:25  <rpk> (AFAIK the answer is no, but someone just asked at a meeting, so can anyone confirm that for me?)
2011-06-13T08:29:26  <eranm> incorrect, WebDriver and Selenium were merged over a year ago, The API for Selenium 2 is the WebDriver API
2011-06-13T08:29:27  <freynaud> rpk: yes, that's the point
2011-06-13T08:30:26  <rpk> freynaud: then whats with the bit on using parallel ant / parallel junit?
2011-06-13T08:31:03  *** cakehero has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T08:31:22  <rpk> I thought I was using parallel ant in order to execute each testcase in parallel from one client?
2011-06-13T08:31:49  <freynaud> rpk: grid has no link with junit or ant
2011-06-13T08:32:21  <freynaud> you can use whaever you want to generate your tests request, it can be java, pythin, anything sending the tests in parallel
2011-06-13T08:32:33  <incorrect> eranm, thanks, i just needed to have that cleared up
2011-06-13T08:32:57  <freynaud> it's not a  selenium feature, it's  something controlled by whatever framework starts the tests
2011-06-13T08:34:23  <rpk> freynaud: ok, but if I'm using the default junit4 implementation, it will attempt to run the tests in sequence, right?  which is why you would use parallel junit or the ant parallel extension?
2011-06-13T08:34:38  <rpk> basically O
2011-06-13T08:34:42  <rpk> (oops)
2011-06-13T08:35:16  <freynaud> rpk: i'm not familiar with junit, i use testNG
2011-06-13T08:35:17  <rpk> basically I'm asking that if I choose to run a test suite, as opposed to a test case, will junit send each testcase all at once to the grid, or wait for results for each testcase before proceeding?
2011-06-13T08:35:46  <freynaud> if your tests reach the grid in parallel, they will be executed in parallel, up to the limit ( max_concurrent )
2011-06-13T08:36:00  <Mayank_134> Hi, I have switched to Java tests from HTML format as I had a problem in getting away with onLoad alerts. I still cant seem to supress them in Java based tests, any lead?
2011-06-13T08:36:17  <rpk> freynaud: ok, so in which case it depends on if my test runner waits for a response or sends multiple requests at once then, correct?
2011-06-13T08:36:32  <Mayank_134> simonstewart, AutomatedTester: ^^
2011-06-13T08:36:37  <freynaud> rpk: yes. You should see that on the hub.

2011-06-13T09:35:34  <jimevans> hmm... so deprecating setSelected means a change in semantics for check boxes.
2011-06-13T09:36:07  <jimevans> at least in IE.
2011-06-13T09:36:28  <simonstewart> how so?
2011-06-13T09:36:32  <jimevans> with a simple click, the onchange event doesn't fire; you have to change focus
2011-06-13T09:36:48  <jimevans> setSelected() fired the event.
2011-06-13T09:37:24  <simonstewart> Which is the better thing to do?
2011-06-13T09:37:36  <jimevans> i dunno. i'm asking the same thing.
2011-06-13T09:37:40  <simonstewart> :)
2011-06-13T09:37:56  <jimevans> let's look at it from a user's point of view.
2011-06-13T09:38:03  <simonstewart> Was just about to say that :)
2011-06-13T09:38:11  <jimevans> they were calling setSelected(), which fired the onChange event.
2011-06-13T09:38:24  <simonstewart> Ahhh... you're going from the opposite way to me
2011-06-13T09:38:26  <jimevans> now, we're telling them to use click() instead, which doesn't, which could break tests.
2011-06-13T09:38:26  *** jcake has quit IRC
2011-06-13T09:38:32  <simonstewart> What events are captured when a user does a click in IE?
2011-06-13T09:38:39  *** freynaud has quit IRC
2011-06-13T09:38:44  <simonstewart> (a real click)
2011-06-13T09:38:52  <jimevans> on a check box?
2011-06-13T09:38:56  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-06-13T09:39:12  <simonstewart> Or, put another way, is click doing the Right Thing with checkboxs?
2011-06-13T09:39:14  <jimevans> do we have an event logging page already in the test website?
2011-06-13T09:39:24  <simonstewart> Not one with checkboxes
2011-06-13T09:39:29  <jimevans> hmph
2011-06-13T09:39:44  <Mayank_134> simonstewart: Can you please let me know how to possibly suppress the onLoad alerts or to "auto-ok" them in Java based tests?
2011-06-13T09:40:05  <simonstewart> use selenium 2/webdriver
2011-06-13T09:40:10  <simonstewart> let the alert open
2011-06-13T09:40:14  <simonstewart> driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss()
2011-06-13T09:40:27  <jimevans> simonstewart: well, i'll need to code one up. i don't know off the top of my head what events checkbox clicks fire.
2011-06-13T09:40:36  <simonstewart> It's not possible in Selenium 1
2011-06-13T09:40:54  <simonstewart> Just capture focus, blur, change, click
2011-06-13T09:41:05  <simonstewart> mousedown, mouseup if you're being very thorough
2011-06-13T09:41:36  <Mayank_134> Oh!! thanks, Ill try it! and I could not suprise you by removing the alert code from selenium-api.js or selenium-bot.js
2011-06-13T09:45:31  <jimevans> simonstewart: click on a checkbox in IE fires mousedown, focus, mouseup, and click (in that order)
2011-06-13T09:45:48  <jimevans> focus change after a click fires change and blur (also in that order)

2011-06-13T09:58:08  *** QAguy has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T10:00:37  <jimevans> i can make the argument either way.
2011-06-13T10:03:47  <simonstewart> I'd be tempted to "do the thing the user would do"
2011-06-13T10:04:07  <simonstewart> and then provide a wrapper that fires all the exciting events a user could ever wish for
2011-06-13T10:05:00  <jimevans> that's fair.
2011-06-13T10:05:58  <jimevans> i'll change the tests then (because that's where it shows up, is in the tests that used to call .setSelected(), and now have to call .click())

2011-06-13T11:15:15  <barancev> jimevans: I've added a comment to 1812 - I can't reproduce it on win7
2011-06-13T11:15:30  <nilobject> I'm writing a slightly more comprehensive test that will hopefully help me narrow this down.
2011-06-13T11:15:43  <jimevans> i thought that might be the case. native events should solve the problem on platforms where they are enabled.
2011-06-13T11:16:45  <nilobject> I believe adding an "onclick" attribute works, as does using a raw "addEventListener" call, but something about the way MooTools implements addEvent() makes it inoperable on Firefox via Selenium.
2011-06-13T11:17:02  <nilobject> I'll be spending a good portion of today trying to reduce it to a minimum failing test case.
2011-06-13T11:17:23  <jimevans> wow $/java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/ElementSelectingTest.java needs a pretty radical overhaul after deprecating setSelected()

2011-06-13T11:24:18  <acecombat2> how to start xvfb in grid 2?
2011-06-13T11:25:17  <acecombat2> is it possible to turn selenium into a webservice? like start the browser on serverside, and wait for further instructions from user.
2011-06-13T11:25:32  <acecombat2> once it starts notify client that browser is ready for testing
2011-06-13T11:25:41  <acecombat2> and then client sends tests
2011-06-13T11:25:55  <RossPatterson> acecombat2: That's pretty much what Selenium RC does.

2011-06-13T11:37:02  <nilobject> Additionally, just including MooTools on the page is enough to break "onclick" and "addEventListener" when Selenium is running Firefox.

I'm going to have a database class that handles all the configuration info. Is it better to have a "get_patient" method in the database class, which returns a Patient object and encapsulates all the SQL/whatever, or is it better to have a "get" method in database class which returns a record set based on passed-in SQL, and have my Patient

2011-06-13T12:12:39  <andytinkham> It sounds like the Repository pattern would be 2 or 3 classes - Patient, PatientRepository, and maybe Database. If Database was separate, it would have the get method that takes SQL. PatientRepository would have a get method that handles building the SQL for the appropriate patient filtering as needed, and Patient handles the business logic on patients

2011-06-13T12:43:35  <jimevans> Archdude: ok, well then i can't help you. i actively avoid using rc wherever i can, and practice the head-in-the-sand ostrich method of dealing with it.
2011-06-13T12:45:03  <barancev> jimevans: have you managed to fix #1654 in r12477 ?
2011-06-13T12:45:04  <selbot2>  open/new IEDriver doesn't scroll and fails to click element in overflow - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1654
2011-06-13T12:45:04  <selbot2> james.h.evans.jr@gmail.com 3 minutes ago - JimEvans: Updating IE native code so that click will properly handle <option> elements, since setSelected() and toggle() are now deprecated. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12477
2011-06-13T12:45:20  <jimevans> barancev: no.
2011-06-13T12:45:53  <barancev> jimevans: ok, just asked :)
2011-06-13T12:45:54  <jimevans> i'm not throughly convinced of the robustness of the solution presented in that issue report.
2011-06-13T12:46:33  <barancev> solution? it there a solution?
2011-06-13T12:47:14  <jimevans> in the issue report, there's a javascript function that supposedly solves the problem.
2011-06-13T12:47:18  <barancev> how to make this javascript code work together with native events?
2011-06-13T12:48:15  <jimevans> that's part of the challenge. it'd have to be integrated into the C++ dll for IE.
2011-06-13T12:48:35  <jimevans> and again, i'm not convinced of the correctness or the robustness of the javascript presented there.
2011-06-13T12:48:36  <acecombat2> jimevans: how would I send data to the remote selenium test?
2011-06-13T12:48:46  *** adamgoucher has quit IRC
2011-06-13T12:48:48  <acecombat2> jetty?
2011-06-13T12:49:03  <acecombat2> if jetty, how does jetty talk to the selenium test?
2011-06-13T12:49:16  <acecombat2> or should my selenium test embed jetty?
2011-06-13T12:49:24  <jimevans> acecombat2: are you using the rc api or the webdriver api?
2011-06-13T12:49:34  <acecombat2> jimevans: webdriver
2011-06-13T12:49:52  <acecombat2> wait what is the rc api?
2011-06-13T12:50:05  <jimevans> then to answer your question, it uses a json-over-http wire protocol, documented in the project wiki
2011-06-13T12:50:19  <acecombat2> ah okay
2011-06-13T12:50:27  <jimevans> the rc api is the older api that was available in selenium 1.x
2011-06-13T12:50:27  <acecombat2> how do I discover the sessionid?
2011-06-13T12:50:45  <acecombat2> json-over-http wire protocol seems like the right place
2011-06-13T12:51:10  <jimevans> it's embedded in each command/response pair, but i'm not sure this is the correct approach.
2011-06-13T12:51:10  <acecombat2> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol ?
2011-06-13T12:51:17  *** barancev has quit IRC
2011-06-13T12:51:20  <jimevans> yes, that's it.
2011-06-13T12:51:34  <jimevans> it's embedded in each command/response pair, but i'm not sure this is the correct approach.
2011-06-13T12:51:47  <jimevans> s/it's/the session id is
2011-06-13T12:51:49  <acecombat2> oh
2011-06-13T12:52:02  <acecombat2> not the correct approach?
2011-06-13T12:52:20  <acecombat2> how about selenium test embedding a lightweight http server
2011-06-13T12:52:34  <acecombat2> wait is that even possible
2011-06-13T12:52:39  <acecombat2> so lost
2011-06-13T12:52:42  <acecombat2> and getting hungry
2011-06-13T12:52:51  <jimevans> somewhere in your test, which is running on your local machine (even though the browser is located somewhere else), there's a findElement(By.xpath("somestring")) call right?
2011-06-13T12:53:04  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: acecombat2 has put Selenium RC on SO
2011-06-13T12:53:17  <AutomatedTester> not remotewebdriver so you cant use JSON Wire
2011-06-13T12:53:27  <jimevans> AutomatedTester: that was part of my confusion
2011-06-13T12:53:32  <acecombat2> jimevans: yes
2011-06-13T12:53:49  <acecombat2> AutomatedTester: I am using remotewebdriver
2011-06-13T12:54:00  <acecombat2> I wil add that on so
2011-06-13T12:54:10  <jimevans> okay, then *on your local machine* you have to re-execute the findElement call with the new xpath.
2011-06-13T12:54:12  <AutomatedTester> acecombat2: your SO question says you are using the Se1 API
2011-06-13T12:54:34  <acecombat2> jimevans: ohhhh
2011-06-13T12:54:39  <jimevans> this has nothing to do with what's happening on the remote box.
2011-06-13T12:54:44  <acecombat2> I see
2011-06-13T12:54:45  *** miker2 has quit IRC
2011-06-13T12:54:51  <jimevans> all you're doing is passing commands one at a time across the wire.
2011-06-13T12:55:01  *** jcake has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T12:55:02  <acecombat2> I see
2011-06-13T12:55:24  <acecombat2> so I just catch the exception on my local machine using RemoteWebDriver
2011-06-13T12:55:35  <acecombat2> and then try find the element again
2011-06-13T12:55:48  <jimevans> exactly. now as for how you inject the new xpath, i've no idea
2011-06-13T12:55:49  <acecombat2> and try the previous action and continue with rest of the test!
2011-06-13T12:55:57  <acecombat2> hmmm
2011-06-13T12:56:11  <jimevans> especially since you're using java, which is a compiled language.
2011-06-13T12:56:12  <acecombat2> wait injecting the new xpath?
2011-06-13T12:56:24  <acecombat2> I see
2011-06-13T12:56:39  <acecombat2> so no way to pass on that new string data to currently running remotewebdriver instance
2011-06-13T12:56:43  <AutomatedTester> acecombat2: how are you planning on getting the new locator in without recompiling
2011-06-13T12:56:44  <jimevans> you've been talking all along about updating the xpath *at run time*, unless i misunderstand
2011-06-13T12:56:53  <acecombat2> yes that is correct
2011-06-13T12:57:03  <jimevans> wait. let me rephrase that.
2011-06-13T12:57:31  <jimevans> you're talking about updating the xpath at run time *on your local machine* without recompiling your locally running test.
2011-06-13T12:57:43  <acecombat2> acecombat2: well, catch the exception locally, tell the browser running on my server?
2011-06-13T12:57:49  *** barancev has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T12:58:10  <AutomatedTester> acecombat2: how will you update it, without recompiling
2011-06-13T12:58:10  <acecombat2> jimevans: yes. the test is running remotely
2011-06-13T12:58:26  <jimevans> no, the test is running locally. the commands are being executed remotely.
2011-06-13T12:58:31  <acecombat2> ah
2011-06-13T12:58:54  <jimevans> so your workflow would be as follows:
2011-06-13T12:59:08  *** Mayank has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T12:59:12  <jimevans> 1. you have a test case with a failing xpath written in java code.
2011-06-13T12:59:27  <acecombat2> ok
2011-06-13T12:59:28  <jimevans> 2. your customer gives you the updated xpath to the element.
2011-06-13T12:59:42  <jimevans> 3. you change the xpath in the source code of the test.
2011-06-13T12:59:52  <jimevans> 4. you recompile the test
2011-06-13T13:00:00  *** RossPatterson has quit IRC
2011-06-13T13:00:33  <jimevans> 5. you re-run the test, connecting to the *same*, *still running* remote server you were using before.
2011-06-13T13:00:51  <jimevans> the server has no concept of the "test". it just executes commands one at a time
2011-06-13T13:00:57  <acecombat2> I see
2011-06-13T13:01:05  <acecombat2> that's what it means by flat?
2011-06-13T13:01:07  <jimevans> the server doesn't remember the xpath from one findElement() call to the next
2011-06-13T13:01:40  <acecombat2> but that workflow, the test will have to start all over again from the beginning am I correct?
2011-06-13T13:02:09  <jimevans> yes, i'm afraid so, unless you have some mechanism locally to read that new xpath string.
2011-06-13T13:02:18  <jimevans> and that's something you'd have to devise.
2011-06-13T13:02:45  <acecombat2> how would I implement that mechanism?
2011-06-13T13:02:45  <jimevans> the java code doesn't run interactively. it's not going to pause and wait for you to enter some new xpath string.
2011-06-13T13:02:51  <acecombat2> right.
2011-06-13T13:03:24  <jimevans> and just because you happen to have a long-running server process executing commands from the test remotely doesn't change that.
2011-06-13T13:04:11  <acecombat2> so the Test itself needs to be a server listening to teh client
2011-06-13T13:04:15  <acecombat2> I can't use RemoteWebDriver then
2011-06-13T13:04:20  <jimevans> um, no.
2011-06-13T13:05:02  <jimevans> i'm not quite sure i understand why it's important to change the locator at run time.
2011-06-13T13:05:11  <acecombat2> for instance
2011-06-13T13:05:21  <acecombat2> testing many similar links on a web app
2011-06-13T13:05:37  <acecombat2> sometimes there's variations
2011-06-13T13:05:44  <acecombat2> like slightest change in xpath
2011-06-13T13:05:51  <acecombat2> will not work
2011-06-13T13:05:55  <acecombat2> across different pages
2011-06-13T13:06:07  <acecombat2> now I know you are saying, use ID, but this web app generates random ID
2011-06-13T13:06:32  <acecombat2> so instead of restarting all over again
2011-06-13T13:06:48  <acecombat2> it will continue on with the "alternative" xpath
2011-06-13T13:07:00  <acecombat2> provided by the client
2011-06-13T13:07:01  <acecombat2> whenever the test encounteres problem
2011-06-13T13:07:26  <acecombat2> basically when rendered in the browser, the similar series of link seems perfectly same
2011-06-13T13:07:27  <jimevans> first question is why would testing many links be a single test anyway, but that's not terribly important.
2011-06-13T13:07:30  <acecombat2> but in reality there are cases where xpath is different
2011-06-13T13:07:41  <jimevans> if you already have the alternative xpath, it's much easier.
2011-06-13T13:08:02  <jimevans> but that's not what i understood you to describe before.
2011-06-13T13:08:12  <acecombat2> for instance, testing many links to products
2011-06-13T13:08:59  <jimevans> okay, let me back up a step.
2011-06-13T13:09:03  <acecombat2> no the alternative xpath (or the correct xpath for that specific page) still needs to be defined by the user
2011-06-13T13:09:13  *** kev_s has left #selenium
2011-06-13T13:09:36  <acecombat2> yes...its confusing
2011-06-13T13:10:15  <acecombat2> so for example, product links xpath is /html/body/div/a but sometimes it's /html/body/div/span/a
2011-06-13T13:10:19  <acecombat2> same product links
2011-06-13T13:10:22  <acecombat2> but different xpath
2011-06-13T13:10:22  <acecombat2> test fails
2011-06-13T13:10:30  <acecombat2> have to start all over again
2011-06-13T13:11:02  <jimevans> okay, so catch the NoSuchElementException, log that the xpath was incorrect to a log file, and continue on to the next link.
2011-06-13T13:11:13  <jimevans> at the end of the test, you have a list of links that are incorrect.
2011-06-13T13:11:36  <acecombat2> wow
2011-06-13T13:11:40  <acecombat2> didn't think of that lol
2011-06-13T13:11:58  <jimevans> then you can go fix up the ones that are wrong.
2011-06-13T13:12:07  <acecombat2> yes
2011-06-13T13:12:20  <acecombat2> that is the path of least resistance
2011-06-13T13:12:23  <acecombat2> I am obliged to follow
2011-06-13T13:12:26  <jimevans> and the next time you run the test, you're golden.
2011-06-13T13:12:29  <acecombat2> yes
2011-06-13T13:12:41  <acecombat2> also what if client is away for the weekend
2011-06-13T13:12:48  <acecombat2> the test is just sitting there waiting
2011-06-13T13:12:50  <acecombat2> and waiting
2011-06-13T13:12:55  <acecombat2> eating up memory and cpu
2011-06-13T13:12:55  *** celm has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T13:12:56  <jimevans> but it's not waiting.
2011-06-13T13:13:03  <acecombat2> err I mean the browser
2011-06-13T13:13:09  <jimevans> it's not.
2011-06-13T13:13:19  <acecombat2> for my approach I mean
2011-06-13T13:13:23  <jimevans> at the end of the test, you call driver.quit(), which quits the browser.
2011-06-13T13:13:24  <acecombat2> well doesn't matter
2011-06-13T13:13:30  <acecombat2> I will simply log teh erroneous ones
2011-06-13T13:13:39  <acecombat2> and then notify the user after the test fails
2011-06-13T13:13:47  <acecombat2> who will define the corrections
2011-06-13T13:13:53  <acecombat2> and run the test again
2011-06-13T13:14:07  <jimevans> that is exactly what you *should* do.
2011-06-13T13:14:17  <acecombat2> so I have to call driver.quit()?
2011-06-13T13:14:21  <acecombat2> to close the browser?
2011-06-13T13:14:22  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-06-13T13:14:31  <jimevans> yes. absolutely.
2011-06-13T13:14:51  <jimevans> otherwise, the browser stays open on the remote machine.
2011-06-13T13:15:01  <acecombat2> ah
2011-06-13T13:15:22  <acecombat2> jimevans: last question, how do I get xvfb to boot on the remote machine before the test is run?
2011-06-13T13:15:36  <jimevans> no idea. not a linux guy.
2011-06-13T13:15:38  <acecombat2> in rc 1 it seems like you edit pom.xml

2011-06-13T13:18:49  <JakeSays> jimevans: lol yeah i usually do too, but it'll allow me to use way junior programmers to help write tests
2011-06-13T13:19:46  <jimevans> jtal: so you can see what's happening while the test is running, or after it's finished?
2011-06-13T13:20:20  <jtal> both
2011-06-13T13:20:42  <jtal> its failing to find an element and I cant tell whats going on because it happens to fast
2011-06-13T13:20:50  <jtal> I see a "slow mode" check box but it doesnt seem to have an effect
2011-06-13T13:20:52  <JakeSays> oh cool - the formatters are just extensions.
2011-06-13T13:21:11  <jimevans> jtal: oh, you're using ide then?
2011-06-13T13:22:16  <jtal> I wrote a perl script, when I execute it from my laptop, it seems to open a browser from the server that is hosting selenium
2011-06-13T13:22:24  <jtal> (opens up in X11 on my macbook)
2011-06-13T13:22:40  <jtal> but the browser stuff blows by too fast (I'm new to selenium if you cant tell)
2011-06-13T13:22:45  <jtal> so I coul be using it all wrong :>
2011-06-13T13:23:26  <jimevans> yeah, okay, then it sounds like you're using the selenium test runner or the selenium rc api. in either case, i'm not the guy to help.
2011-06-13T13:23:32  <jtal> first 4 tests pass, but 5th one fails because it cant find an input box I am referring to by name
2011-06-13T13:23:38  <jtal> how do you use it?

2011-06-13T13:31:25  <jimevans> i'm tempted to say "no, i don't know anything about the ie driver", but AutomatedTester, jarib, and other would call me a liar.
2011-06-13T13:31:43  <AutomatedTester> jimevans: knows nothing
2011-06-13T13:31:47  <JakeSays> lol
2011-06-13T13:31:48  <AutomatedTester> and knows everything
2011-06-13T13:31:55  <jimevans> i'm pretty much responsible for the native-code implementation of the ie driver.
2011-06-13T13:32:02  <JakeSays> ah
2011-06-13T13:32:25  <JakeSays> so compared to, say, the chromium driver, how does it compare?
2011-06-13T13:32:38  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: its better
2011-06-13T13:32:39  <JakeSays> seems like IE would be a real pain in the ass to automate
2011-06-13T13:32:48  <jimevans> it is.
2011-06-13T13:33:03  <jimevans> a pain in the ass, that is.
2011-06-13T13:33:12  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: ChromeDriver is missing features

2011-06-13T13:33:31  <JakeSays> AutomatedTester: oh? hmm
2011-06-13T13:33:33  *** rbalent has quit IRC
2011-06-13T13:33:35  <jimevans> the IE driver is pretty much feature-complete with the webdriver api.
2011-06-13T13:33:58  <jimevans> chromedriver doesn't handle alerts yet.
2011-06-13T13:34:11  <jimevans> (as far as i recall)
2011-06-13T13:34:12  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: nor native events
2011-06-13T13:34:30  <jimevans> but the ie driver has its own difficulties.
2011-06-13T13:34:46  <AutomatedTester> at least we know it will work with future versions
2011-06-13T13:34:49  <JakeSays> does the ie driver support setting the browser window size?
2011-06-13T13:35:00  <jimevans> no, but you can use javascript to do so.
2011-06-13T13:35:04  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: yes, its called JavaScript
2011-06-13T13:35:14  *** THE_REPTAR has joined #selenium
2011-06-13T13:35:30  <jimevans> no driver supports that in the WebDriver API. there's not a method exposed for it.
2011-06-13T13:35:30  <JakeSays> thats one thing chrome doesnt support
2011-06-13T13:36:00  <JakeSays> jimevans: yeah, and i thought that was an odd thing to not have in the API.
2011-06-13T13:38:29  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: I know a lot of people who hate it
2011-06-13T13:38:31  <jimevans> there's an open feature request for it. #174

2011-06-13T13:38:55  <JakeSays> AutomatedTester: who hate not having it?
2011-06-13T13:39:03  <AutomatedTester> so its easy to monkey patch/Extension method a new command
2011-06-13T13:39:27  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: many people in my team
2011-06-13T13:39:58  <JakeSays> i think the difficulty is in determining the window size given the content size.

2011-06-13T13:40:35  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: does it matter for an automated test?
2011-06-13T13:41:51  <JakeSays> AutomatedTester: it especially matters in automated testing. we do visual tests by comparing screen captures to reference images.
2011-06-13T13:42:13  <JakeSays> window chrome just gets in the way.
2011-06-13T13:42:23  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: images from the browser are from the browser canvas in Selenium
2011-06-13T13:42:48  <JakeSays> AutomatedTester: right, but that canvas needs to be a specific size.
2011-06-13T13:43:50  <AutomatedTester> only if you have divs that float anywhere on the page
2011-06-13T13:43:53  <JakeSays> setting the window size isn't useful - i'd want to set the canvas size and have the actual window size adjusted accordingly.
2011-06-13T13:44:40  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: ref tests are quite hard to do properly
2011-06-13T13:44:57  <JakeSays> yes they are
2011-06-13T13:45:14  <JakeSays> but they're much easier if the content size is constant

2011-06-13T14:13:08  <jimevans> ^^ ha!
2011-06-13T14:13:39  <polm> I've got a bunch of anchors. When you click on them, they get selected and gain the "active" class.
2011-06-13T14:13:47  <polm> Normally they all have a class nothing else has.
2011-06-13T14:14:11  <polm> Then, after they're all selected, they pop up data elsewhere on the page in another single-purpose class.
2011-06-13T14:14:21  <polm> I want to make sure none of the data that pops up is "n/a"
2011-06-13T14:15:03  <polm> I tried pulling everything with the selector class, but after the first one all the references expire.

2011-06-13T14:33:17  <JakeSays> so just the API direct then
2011-06-13T14:33:31  <AutomatedTester> barancev: main issues will be the str/unicode issues between < py3 and > py3
2011-06-13T14:34:01  <AutomatedTester> and then will be then the brackets
2011-06-13T14:34:21  <jimevans> pretty much. well, i isolate my test cases by creating a layer of abstraction around the WebDriver API, but yeah.

2011-06-13T14:53:55  <jarib> it's just not true.

2011-06-13T14:56:21  <jimevans> key phrase to remember when talking about automated tests to management-bots: automated tests are code.
2011-06-13T14:56:43  <jarib> and if you want to work fast, you want to work with clean code
2011-06-13T14:56:52  <JakeSays> jimevans: lol yeah but code == $$ in their eyes as well.

2011-06-13T14:57:58  <jimevans> the point is, they're code whether you write it well, or whether you let some recorder write it for you poorly.
2011-06-13T14:58:17  <jimevans> you have to help them see that recorded code is still code, just poorly written code.

2011-06-13T15:05:03  <barancev> AutomatedTester: I have not tried to build from source yet, only easy_install
2011-06-13T15:05:33  <AutomatedTester> oh so your statement above was a question?
2011-06-13T15:05:59  <barancev> it is not Selenium it is rdflib failed to install

2011-06-13T15:07:49  <JakeSays> hmm. does webdriver support .net 4?
2011-06-13T15:08:19  <AutomatedTester> JakeSays: it should
2011-06-13T15:08:40  <JakeSays> i noticed its built with 3.5
2011-06-13T15:09:37  <AutomatedTester> built with 3.5 which means you can build your project with .NET 4
2011-06-13T15:11:49  <JakeSays> we have .net 4 versions of the webdriver deps already in our tree.
2011-06-13T15:15:21  <JakeSays> seems to build ok against .net 4
2011-06-13T15:15:31  <barancev> really looks like a syntax error in rdflib, that's strange

2011-06-13T16:39:50  <sfbrian> not running selenium.stop()?
2011-06-13T16:39:53  <sfbrian> ;)
2011-06-13T16:40:11  * ner0x tries it out.
2011-06-13T16:41:57  <ner0x> Wonderful. I didn't know $sel->stop() was better than $sel->close();
2011-06-13T16:42:58  <sfbrian> never used close() before
