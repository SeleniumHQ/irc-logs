2011-05-09T05:20:47  <ato> Yes, but not out of the box.
2011-05-09T05:21:28  <ato> You need to download the OperaDriver JAR and expose it on your classpath for it to work with Opera.
2011-05-09T05:21:33  <ato> You'll find it here: https://github.com/operasoftware/operadriver
2011-05-09T05:22:11  <britle> ato: thanks for the link! Can I do this for ruby's bindings  (selenium-webdriver gem) ?
2011-05-09T05:22:39  <ato> Yes, but there's no native Ruby implementation for Opera.
2011-05-09T05:22:59  <ato> But you can use the remote client in selenium-webdriver to connect to OperaDriver.
2011-05-09T05:23:20  <ato> You'll need to edit selenium-webdriver and add some stuff for it, though.

2011-05-09T05:32:25  <jarib> :)
2011-05-09T05:32:38  <britle> ouch :D Why is that one so big
2011-05-09T05:32:56  <simonstewart> So, what've I missed? I've not checked the selenium mailing lists for about 3 weeks
2011-05-09T05:33:26  <ato> britle: Bloat!
2011-05-09T05:33:28  * ato hides.
2011-05-09T05:33:44  <jarib> britle: the server is 11MB, but we're not currently doing platform-specific gems - so 11MB x 3 = 33MB
2011-05-09T05:34:13  <jarib> simonstewart: not much, really. it's been quiet
2011-05-09T05:34:37  <simonstewart> We'll soon change that :)
2011-05-09T05:35:12  <simonstewart> Hmph! test_javascript breaks
2011-05-09T05:36:31  <simonstewart> But not on chrome
2011-05-09T05:36:39  <simonstewart> I think I see what happeneed here
2011-05-09T05:36:54  <simonstewart> Anyone know the status of the continuous builds?
2011-05-09T05:38:12  <ato> There are three kinds of different values.
2011-05-09T05:38:57  <ato> There's the DOM @value attribute, the texteditable value attribute (on INPUT, SELECT, TEXTAREA), and there's textContent on the BUTTON, which is _treated_ as a value.
2011-05-09T05:38:58  <britle> jarib: I've downloaded "chromedriver_win32_12.0.727.0.zip" from 20th April. I assume that's what you mean. It says it needs Chrome 12(dev channel). So chrome is supported only for dev channel? Or I picked the wrong file
2011-05-09T05:39:21  <ato> Does the deprecation of getValue mean that you with getAttribute no longer will be able to access the DOM value attribute?
2011-05-09T05:39:22  <simonstewart> element.getAttribute and element.getText are your friends
2011-05-09T05:39:59  <simonstewart> getAttribute has never made a differentiation between attributes and properties
2011-05-09T05:40:48  <Stuk> I mentioned to ato that jquery 1.6 is making this distinction, and I think this is the right thing to do
2011-05-09T05:40:54  <simonstewart> The current impl is in that link I (ummm) linked to earlier
2011-05-09T05:40:57  <ato> We're dealing with what's been set in the html against what the current value is/things that only exist in the DOM.

2011-05-09T05:53:35  <barancev> could anybody explain why Launcher.Utils.getDefaultHTMLSuiteUrl takes browserURL as a parameter, not serverURL?
2011-05-09T05:53:55  <simonstewart> Because it needs to know that baseURL for the selenium instance
2011-05-09T05:53:55  <barancev> String url = Urls.toProtocolHostAndPort(startURL);
2011-05-09T05:54:09  <barancev> url += "/selenium-server/core/RemoteRunner.html?" + ...
2011-05-09T05:54:38  <ato> jarib, simonstewart: So the reason why we haven't moved to atoms yet is because our ecmascript-debugger service is broken.  It disables JIT compilation (which isn't ideal) and has some serious problems with the syntax.
2011-05-09T05:54:42  <ato> Stuk is working on replacing it with a regular ecmascript service.
2011-05-09T05:54:49  <simonstewart> interesting
2011-05-09T05:55:20  <ato> Which is, incidently, why watir-webdriver fails with OperaDriver currently, because watir-webdriver is using scripts that are too advanced for us currently.
2011-05-09T05:55:50  <simonstewart> Fascinating
2011-05-09T05:56:09  <simonstewart> Why the difference?
2011-05-09T05:56:47  <ato> Who knows.  Someone thought it would be a cool idea to have an ecmascript-debugger.  Then we replaced our JS engine.  And noone continued maintaining what we're using.
2011-05-09T05:57:03  <simonstewart> ouch
2011-05-09T05:57:10  <simonstewart> That's distinctly suboptimal
2011-05-09T05:57:30  <ato> So options are to either figure out what's wrong with the debugger and get it fixed, or replacing it with another service.
2011-05-09T05:57:42  <simonstewart> Why not use the normal JS service?
2011-05-09T05:57:51  <ato> Problem is that it's extremely hard to debug the debugger.  And the normal JS service is extremely slow for some reason.
2011-05-09T05:58:01  <simonstewart> That's a good reason
2011-05-09T05:58:22  <ato> But Stuk know more than me about this.
2011-05-09T06:00:05  <Stuk> simonstewart: ecmascript-debugger exists to allow breakpoints and such to be set in dragonfly, but to do this the JIT must be disabled. It existed first, hence why it's being used in OperaDriver. Ecmascript-service was written for OperaDriver so that the JIT could remain enabled, but debugger worked "well enough", so there wasn't massive incentive to change to service
2011-05-09T06:00:26  <simonstewart> That makes sense
2011-05-09T06:00:44  <Stuk> I'm now in the process of changing to service, but it's causing a few headaches :)
2011-05-09T06:00:58  <simonstewart> I can only imagine
2011-05-09T06:01:01  <ato> Oh, and _good news_!
2011-05-09T06:01:16  <ato> Stuk and Martin (a core guy) increased performance on Linux by 5-6 times.
2011-05-09T06:02:20  <simonstewart> Holy shit
2011-05-09T06:02:23  <simonstewart> how?
2011-05-09T06:02:56  <ato> Well, it was very slow.  Now it's on-par with OS X performance, but basically it's slightly embarrassing.
2011-05-09T06:03:31  <simonstewart> Ahhh....
2011-05-09T06:03:50  <simonstewart> Generally I tend to find those in my code with a little comment above it saying something like "this is slow, but unlikely to be used"
2011-05-09T06:04:41  <Stuk> simonstewart: As we're sending a lot of small amounts of data, and this was getting buffered a lot in linux due to the TCP_NODELAY option on the socket. This was disabled in driver, but not in opera, so it was turned off, and resulted in a massive speedup
2011-05-09T06:05:13  <simonstewart> Very nice.

2011-05-09T07:10:40  <simonstewart> Which version of the selenium server are you using?
2011-05-09T07:10:44  <simonstewart> You need 2.0b3 or later
2011-05-09T07:11:42  <nd_> I use the grid distribution with ant ... launch-remote-control

2011-05-09T07:13:25  <simonstewart> Right
2011-05-09T07:13:30  <nd_> lemme try
2011-05-09T07:15:36  <nd_> simonstewart: how do I specify hubURL for the standalone server?
2011-05-09T07:16:04  <nd_> not via -hubURL it complains
2011-05-09T07:16:54  <simonstewart> Hmm... the 2.0b3 server is just a standalone one
2011-05-09T07:17:02  <simonstewart> not aware of grid
2011-05-09T07:17:07  <simonstewart> The next release will be

2011-05-09T07:17:13  <nd_> yes, that's why I used the included one

2011-05-09T07:19:55  <simonstewart> OK. You need to replace selenium-server-1.0.3-standalone.jar with the 2.0b3 standalone server
2011-05-09T07:20:24  <barancev> it hangs in quit
2011-05-09T07:20:42  <simonstewart> The reason you need to do that is that selenium 1.0.3 ain't compatible with Firefox 4
2011-05-09T07:21:08  <nd_> I see, I'll try that
2011-05-09T07:22:21  <nd_> hmm... and starting a remote-control with environment *chrome starts firefox on this os x box
2011-05-09T07:22:55  <simonstewart> You should still have the selenium-grid-hub-standalone jar

2011-05-09T08:26:33  <andytinkham> jarib: My guess is the most likely culprit is rubygems 1.8.0 vs. 1.8.1. Everything is working now for me though. Thanks!
2011-05-09T08:27:46  <jimevans> why isn't getCssPropertyValue an atom? or is it?
2011-05-09T08:29:03  <jarib> simonstewart: found another interesting bug the other day. closure's goog.array.some will use [].some (i.e. native) if it's available, otherwise use its own implementation
2011-05-09T08:29:10  <simonstewart> //javascript/webdriver-atoms:get_effective_style
2011-05-09T08:29:27  <simonstewart> jarib: bug?
2011-05-09T08:29:28  <jimevans> hah! thanks, simonstewart.
2011-05-09T08:29:34  <simonstewart> Sounds like a nice thing to do, no?
2011-05-09T08:29:41  <jarib> simonstewart: the problem is if the user loads a library like prototype that defines its own [].some, with different semantics
2011-05-09T08:29:48  <simonstewart> hohoho
2011-05-09T08:30:00  <jarib> e.g. you can't pass a NodeList to prototype's [].some, since they expect it to implement each()
2011-05-09T08:30:29  <simonstewart> This is why monkey-patching blows balls
2011-05-09T08:30:50  <jarib> if we pull in a newer version of closure, there's a setting to disable the use of native functions
2011-05-09T08:30:56  <jarib> (in the compiler)
2011-05-09T08:31:04  <simonstewart> We can do that, i think
2011-05-09T08:31:07  <jarib> question is, do we want to
2011-05-09T08:31:15  <simonstewart> Want to get the current test_javascript running before I think of that
2011-05-09T08:31:22  <jarib> jason argued a bit against it
2011-05-09T08:31:32  <jarib> but a lot of people use prototype (was the rails default up until recently)
2011-05-09T08:31:40  <simonstewart> The alternative would be to modify closure to check that it's okay to use the native code
2011-05-09T08:32:09  <jarib> that sounds impossible :)
2011-05-09T08:32:13  *** csanchez has joined #selenium
2011-05-09T08:32:20  <simonstewart> Just check the type of .some
2011-05-09T08:32:44  <jarib> wouldn't it be 'function' in both cases?
2011-05-09T08:33:31  <jarib> unless there's an isNative property on functions i'm not sure how you'd do it
2011-05-09T08:33:34  <simonstewart> Yes, but the form of that function looks different in some browsers

2011-05-09T08:35:08  <simonstewart> What was Jason's issue?
2011-05-09T08:36:34  <jarib> not sure he was really against using the setting, but his point was that at some point people can't expect us to work around all their monkey patches
2011-05-09T08:36:55  <simonstewart> Well, i think that's reasonable
2011-05-09T08:37:02  <simonstewart> Sadly, prototype is being unreasonable
2011-05-09T08:38:06  <jarib> yeah, too bad it's quite popular
2011-05-09T08:38:57  <barancev> why DesiredCapabilities.htmlUnitWithJavascript() is deprecated? what to use instead to enable JS in htmlunit driver?

2011-05-09T08:44:06  <jarib> barancev: you can modify the DesiredCapabilities instance, e.g. setJavascriptEnabled(true)
2011-05-09T08:45:59  <barancev> aha, I see, setJavascriptEnabled is not in Capabilities interface. is there any reason why?
2011-05-09T08:46:03  *** sdimkov has joined #selenium
2011-05-09T08:46:52  <jarib> barancev: not all Capabilities are mutable
2011-05-09T08:50:33  <barancev> jarib: would not it be better to throw exception from immutable implementation?
2011-05-09T08:50:53  <simonstewart> There's never a race with sockets
2011-05-09T08:50:54  <barancev> curent implementation provokes to use class instead of interface
2011-05-09T08:51:44  <jarib> i think that makes sense in this case
2011-05-09T08:52:09  <sdimkov> Hi JariB: Quick question - Is there any problem with running multiple browsers in parallel with web-driver? My idea is to have tests that are being run on all browsers at the same time (i.e. 4 ruby scripts driving IE,Chrome,Firefox and Opera). Therefore 3 of them won't be at focus or even not visible as I'll set browsers to fullscreen. Do you see any potential problem with that ?
2011-05-09T08:52:25  <simonstewart> barancev: the class is mutable, the interface not
2011-05-09T08:52:39  <simonstewart> That makes it clear that when you're configuring stuff, you can expect to make changes
2011-05-09T08:53:00  <simonstewart> but once things are configured, the capabilities are read only
2011-05-09T08:53:13  <jarib> sdimkov: yes, not having focus is a potential problem (at least for firefox)
2011-05-09T08:53:33  <jarib> and probably IE as well
2011-05-09T08:53:57  <sdimkov> ok thanks. I guess I'll have to think about VMs
2011-05-09T08:54:03  <jarib> you'll want to do separate displays/VMs to make that work reliably
2011-05-09T08:54:08  <barancev> sdimkov: especially if there are onBlur handlers
2011-05-09T08:54:26  <sdimkov> thanks.
2011-05-09T08:54:56  <sdimkov> what if I solve the visibility issue and leave the focus only. In other words to create more vitrual screens and put browsers in each. Still only one will have focus
2011-05-09T08:56:46  <jarib> sdimkov: not sure what a "virtual screen" is if it doesn't give the browser focus. on linux, using multiple X displays (virtual or not) does solve the focus issues with firefox
2011-05-09T08:56:55  <jarib> you'll just have to try it out
2011-05-09T08:57:00  <barancev> sdimkov: http://help.dottoro.com/ljjhfrjd.php - read about active elements and having focus
2011-05-09T08:58:20  <barancev> within one window manager there is only one focus
2011-05-09T08:59:21  <sdimkov> thanks.
2011-05-09T08:59:44  <barancev> simonstewart: I see, it's reasonable
2011-05-09T09:00:10  <sdimkov> virtualization isn't that scary nor even too much overhead. With container based virtualization I could have one linux with few displays and wind. managers
2011-05-09T09:01:28  <sdimkov> one more follow up question - Do I need Windows to drive IE? I know most of IE versions run fine under wine but the driver is windows binary right? What about the driver binary itself?

2011-05-09T09:47:10  <barancev> does --disable-web-security flag breaks some tests? really?

2011-05-09T09:48:00  <simonstewart> yes. really
2011-05-09T09:48:14  <simonstewart> Sadly "in the wild" rather than "in our test suites"
2011-05-09T09:48:28  <simonstewart> As I said, I'm working to fix that
2011-05-09T09:48:36  <jimevans> one of the other groups here at work has decided to try to switch from WatiN to WebDriver. Guess I just became an in-house support resource.
2011-05-09T09:48:47  <simonstewart> But first, I need to get the build green again
2011-05-09T09:49:02  <simonstewart> jimevans: \o/
2011-05-09T09:49:06  <simonstewart> ?
2011-05-09T09:50:09  <jimevans> yeah, i just got my "how do I build from latest" email...
2011-05-09T09:50:15  <barancev> ok, thanks! in my "wild" cross-domain transitions are often, and I need web security off. there is a workaroung, though
2011-05-09T09:50:27  <simonstewart> That explains why you fixed ./go release to work on windows :)
2011-05-09T09:50:39  <papyromancer> How do I define environments when launching selenium2 standalone server?
2011-05-09T09:50:41  <simonstewart> barancev: yes there is
2011-05-09T09:52:04  <simonstewart> Interesting
2011-05-09T09:54:49  <jimevans> simonstewart: well, not really. my group is happy with ./go dotnet, but their problem is they hadn't updated to VS2008 SP1 yet.
2011-05-09T09:55:14  <simonstewart> Hadn't update to VS2008?
2011-05-09T09:55:26  <jimevans> no, hadn't applied sp1.
2011-05-09T09:55:40  <simonstewart> Ahhhh....
2011-05-09T09:56:01  <simonstewart> That's far less of a challenge to fix than an update to VS2008 from VS2005 or earlier
2011-05-09T09:56:30  <jimevans> ayep. but until recently, they hadn't even updated to 2008. (!)

2011-05-09T09:57:24  <simonstewart> y
2011-05-09T09:58:05  <jimevans> in our case, we shipped the .net 2.0 runtime redist with our installer. (we're a shrink-wrapped software shop)
2011-05-09T09:58:31  <jimevans> didn't want to update to 3.5 because the redist grew from 30-some-odd MB to over 150.

2011-05-09T12:36:12  <jimevans> i'm having a hard time getting IE to recognize the opacity of the covering element.
2011-05-09T12:36:45  <jleyba> As a precondition of click()? or for getAttribute("opacity")?
2011-05-09T12:36:59  <jimevans> as a precondition of click().
2011-05-09T12:37:44  <jleyba> You should just need to pass true as the second argument to bot.dom.isShown
2011-05-09T12:38:08  <jimevans> i'm actually trying to run (the .net equivalent of) org.openqa.selenium.OpacityTest.testShouldBeAbleToClickOnElementsWithOpacityZero()
2011-05-09T12:38:34  <jimevans> hang on a tick.
2011-05-09T12:40:45  <jimevans> ok, i'm not calling the isShown atom directly anywhere. i *am* calling isDisplayed.
2011-05-09T12:43:29  <jimevans> which is an alias for isShown. duh.
2011-05-09T12:44:35  <jleyba> ah sorry about the confusion there
2011-05-09T12:45:12  <jleyba> we named the atom isShown b/c we wanted to indicate it wasn't a simple "style.display != none" check
2011-05-09T12:45:25  *** ivog has quit IRC
2011-05-09T12:45:58  <jimevans> got it. now in the precondition for the test, we're checking that the value of the css property "opacity" is 0. that's not true for IE.

2011-05-09T12:48:23  <jleyba> ok, so that's another bug
2011-05-09T12:49:02  <jimevans> i'm now using the getEffectiveStyle atom in IE, which it wasn't before.
2011-05-09T12:49:17  <jleyba> bot.dom.getEffectiveStyle should either normalize CSS values for opacity (like bot.dom.getOpacity) or the test precondition needs to be updated
2011-05-09T12:50:39  <jimevans> sounds like. i'm not sure what the "right" thing to do there is. the test precondition would have to switch on browser (IE vs. non-IE).
2011-05-09T12:51:17  *** aether__ has quit IRC
2011-05-09T12:51:17  <jimevans> on the other hand, is it up to us to filter and manipulate what the browser tells us is true?
2011-05-09T12:51:54  <jleyba> we have the same problem with color CSS values
2011-05-09T12:52:03  <jleyba> some browsers report hex, others rgb(a)
2011-05-09T12:52:34  <jleyba> do we give users a consistent result for easier tests or stay true to the browser?
2011-05-09T12:52:41  <jleyba> i think a strong argument can be made for the former
2011-05-09T12:52:54  <jimevans> true. the ie bindings munge the color into a hex value if it's a color name. i guess i should do the same for opacity
2011-05-09T12:53:38  <jimevans> i happen to agree, but you could argue it the other way too.
2011-05-09T12:53:55  <jimevans> from the user's perspective though, i think consistency is paramount.
2011-05-09T12:54:09  <jimevans> but that's just my opinion.

2011-05-09T12:55:58  <jimevans> if it were up to me, i'd probably normalize the values for consistency and see if anybody complained. :)

2011-05-09T13:20:19  <tyler_g> it's "java, kind of"
2011-05-09T13:20:42  <tyler_g> having to port all of my ruby automation code to it (without any experience in the language)
2011-05-09T13:21:23  <rlpowell> Ouch.
2011-05-09T13:21:53  <rlpowell> Yeah, really can't help you there; sorry.
2011-05-09T13:22:00  <rlpowell> although all the examples at http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html seem t obe java.
2011-05-09T13:22:08  <rlpowell> Assuming you want to do Sel2.0
2011-05-09T13:22:18  <tyler_g> prefered, yeah
2011-05-09T13:22:56  <rlpowell> Then that should do it?
2011-05-09T13:22:56  <tyler_g> rlpowell: thanks, i'll start diving into that

2011-05-09T13:23:50  <tyler_g> i think so.  problem is that this makes a lot of assumptions that the user is already a java dev, hurdles i have to overcome i guess

2011-05-09T13:27:18  <selbot2_> james.h.evans.jr less than a minute ago - JimEvans: Fixing getCssValue in IE to use the getEffectiveStyle atom. Fixes issue 1610. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12148
2011-05-09T13:32:32  <barancev> is it normal that ./go release generates cpp/IEDriver/atoms.h right in source dir, not in build? it is conflicted when I do svn update
2011-05-09T13:32:56  <rlpowell> It happened to me as well, so apparetnly.
2011-05-09T13:34:13  <jimevans> yes, that's normal. we generate atoms.h in the source directory for a couple of reasons, mostly due to the use of MSBuild to build the IE C++ components.
2011-05-09T13:35:33  <barancev> jimevans: if it is generated, not manually written - may be add it to .svnignore to avoid conflicts?
2011-05-09T13:37:00  <jimevans> that won't work either. consider the developer who does a fresh checkout to a clean directory, then opens WebDriver.sln in Visual Studio. First thing they see is a "missing file" alert. Not a good developer experience.
2011-05-09T13:37:27  <jimevans> The atoms don't change that often.
2011-05-09T13:37:43  <jimevans> In the normal case, you won't see any conflicts even when the file is generated.
2011-05-09T13:37:44  <barancev> well, let it be so
2011-05-09T13:38:26  <jimevans> You've happened to sync up at a moment where there is a bit of activity there, so you'll get conflicts until the code churn on the atoms settles down.

2011-05-09T14:24:42  <barancev> yes, the only two test methods of ChildrenFindingTest that failed are those where getText is used
2011-05-09T14:25:07  <jimevans> what revision are you running on?
2011-05-09T14:26:45  <barancev> latest, 12148
2011-05-09T14:27:27  <jimevans> then I would try a "./go clean test_ie".
2011-05-09T14:28:33  <jimevans> i really, really have no idea what's going on with the java language bindings. i don't really know the language, don't know the architecture, don't know how the runtime works.
2011-05-09T14:29:26  <jimevans> i *do* know that i have no pending changes in my working installation, and ./go test_ie passes for me.
2011-05-09T14:31:12  <barancev> ok, I'll try to make clean build
2011-05-09T14:32:45  <barancev> I've traced in debugger to the moment of sending request - here it is: http://localhost:16500/session/d056f0b1-57b3-4e36-845a-d561a91c5428/element/e31580b1-a67d-4930-96ce-9af94984d035/text
2011-05-09T14:33:28  <jimevans> that doesn't really help.
2011-05-09T14:34:01  <jimevans> all that tells me is that the language bindings are calling the correct url using the json wire protocol.
2011-05-09T14:34:36  <barancev> yes, but I can't dive deeper
2011-05-09T14:34:53  <jimevans> there *might* be some information in the json response sent back
2011-05-09T14:35:13  <jimevans> this is after a clean?
2011-05-09T14:35:22  <barancev> HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
2011-05-09T14:35:30  <rlpowell> I've found tcpdump very helpful.  :)  Found a bug in the (non-trunk) ruby bindings that way.
2011-05-09T14:35:58  <rlpowell> barancev: That error should come along with a dump of the error output from the server.
2011-05-09T14:36:02  <barancev> no, build in progress, that's from previous run
2011-05-09T14:36:02  <jimevans> barancev: yes, i would expect a 500 error; that's what the wire protocol specifies you should receive on an error.
2011-05-09T14:36:25  <jimevans> then i'd hold off trying to troubleshoot it until you have the results of a clean build.
2011-05-09T14:36:41  <jimevans> it sounds like you were loading an old version of the native .dll.
2011-05-09T14:37:24  <jimevans> i'm not sure, but the java build process *may* try to be smart about not rebuilding the jar if the source code files haven't changed (while ignoring changes in embedded binary resources)
2011-05-09T14:38:31  <jimevans> doing a "clean" will force the build process to pick up the latest of the prebuilt native dlls, which were updated about an hour ago.
2011-05-09T14:38:51  <jimevans> since you're not building the native dlls, after all.
2011-05-09T14:39:13  <barancev> no, I have no MSVS

2011-05-09T14:44:28  <jimevans> i thought it might. protip: if you're not building the native code .dlls and there's a change to the prebuilt versions of them, you should clean before building.
2011-05-09T14:44:59  <rlpowell> I spent ... I dunno, 4 hours? this weekend banging my head against something because I hadn't notecide that ./go was saying "I couldn't build that, so I'm using the version in the tree". -_-
2011-05-09T14:46:15  <tyler_g> still failing.  anyone here have experience with getting the selenium client libraries to work in groovy (i'm just using bash/vim as my IDE)
2011-05-09T14:46:42  <tyler_g> i have found examples for getting it to work with 'other' ide's, but i'm attempting to grep this at a low level before using those tools
2011-05-09T14:49:23  <rlpowell> tyler_g: Unfortunately, a basic fact of the selenium community IME is that it's somewhat below the size where you can get quick answers to most questions.  I think this has to do with it being an "I only touch it when it's broken" technology.  Having said that, I suggest you might also post to http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users and/or http://groups.google.com/group/webdriver

2011-05-09T15:09:54  <jsevilleja> I'm trying Selenium for the first time, and I'm trying to do some tests
2011-05-09T15:10:06  <jsevilleja> I want to catch any asynchronous AJAX - HTTP call
2011-05-09T15:10:20  <jsevilleja> and show the URL I'm trying to connect (the asynchronous one)
2011-05-09T15:10:28  <jsevilleja> but I don't know if I can do that
2011-05-09T15:10:39  <jsevilleja> is it possible?
2011-05-09T15:14:03  <rlpowell> I doubt it a lot; taht's not really the level Selenium works at.
2011-05-09T15:14:09  <rlpowell> I'd just use tcpdump for that, myself.
2011-05-09T15:15:55  <jsevilleja> I'm afraid that would be the answer
2011-05-09T15:16:13  <jsevilleja> now I'm doing it with htmlunit, but I would feel more comfortable with a real browser

2011-05-09T15:24:26  <jarib> but we try to follow the unix philosophy, so the correct approach is really using a proxy with a nice API :)
2011-05-09T15:24:33  <webben> I guess you could monitor a squid instance or something from your tests

2011-05-09T15:30:01  <jleyba> k776: do you have a reduced test case we can look at?
2011-05-09T15:30:59  <k776> jleyba: Not readily available, no. The basic case is this: text field with an id on it, then a prototype even listener   $('text_field).observe('blur', function() { });

2011-05-09T15:43:47  <jarib> jleyba: ^
2011-05-09T15:43:51  <jarib> there's a reproduction
2011-05-09T15:44:27  <jleyba> jarib: OK, I'll take a look
2011-05-09T15:45:14  <k776> Excellent. If you want any help testing a fix, you let me know!
2011-05-09T15:45:44  <jarib> k776: so the quick workaround until we fix this is probably   driver.execute_script("$('text_field').trigger('blur')")   or whatever prototype has to do that
2011-05-09T15:45:56  <k776> I'm converting from firewatir, and so far I really like it, but if this bug can't be fixed, it'll kill what I've done so far, since we have a lot of prototype event listeners for blur and focus
2011-05-09T15:46:12  <k776> jarib: hmm, ok
2011-05-09T15:46:47  <jarib> k776: if you were using watir-webdriver instead of capybara, you'd get a working fire_event implementation ;)
2011-05-09T15:47:45  <jarib> although it not being there in webdriver does help us get rid of these bugs
2011-05-09T15:48:41  <jarib> basically the use case for fire_event is to hack around synthesized events not doing the right thing
2011-05-09T15:48:44  <jarib> so better to just fix that
2011-05-09T15:49:11  <jleyba> webdriver shouldn't have any UI interactions that don't map to something the user can do :)
2011-05-09T15:50:04  *** tyler_g has quit IRC
2011-05-09T15:50:57  * jarib nods
2011-05-09T15:54:13  <ato> We should probably have some method for focusing an element without actually clicking it.
2011-05-09T15:54:15  <k776> jleyba: So does that mean there is a webdriver bug on Mac OS X then?
2011-05-09T15:54:36  <jleyba> k776: probably
2011-05-09T15:54:40  <k776> ato: Ya, I'm trying to figure out how to add a focus and blur method to the Capybara API at the moment
2011-05-09T15:54:55  <k776> e.g. page.find("input#field").focus.set(...).blur
2011-05-09T15:54:59  <jleyba> ato: A user cannot directly focus on an element.  They have to do something through the UI, whether that's click, tab, etc.
2011-05-09T15:55:15  <ato> k776: I think the biggest problem we're fighting here is that all platforms and browsers do this differently.
2011-05-09T16:05:16  <jarib> jleyba: do you plan to add the ability to pass command line flags to chrome? the remote debugging protocol could be useful..
2011-05-09T16:05:28  <jleyba> yes it's coming
2011-05-09T16:05:39  <jarib> fantastic
2011-05-09T16:07:27  *** andytinkham has quit IRC
2011-05-09T16:08:15  <k776> We can use Chrome with WebDriver?
2011-05-09T16:08:18  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-05-09T16:09:24  <jarib> k776: yes
2011-05-09T16:09:49  <k776> Cool…. how?
2011-05-09T16:09:53  <jarib> k776: you could try the reproduction script and see if chrome has the same issue
2011-05-09T16:10:11  <jarib> just replace .for(:firefox) with .for(:chrome), then follow the instructions
2011-05-09T16:10:11  <k776> jarib: Sure thing, what config lines do I need to add?
2011-05-09T16:10:14  <k776> Ok
2011-05-09T16:10:35  <jarib> (you need to download a binary + be on the dev channel)
2011-05-09T16:11:17  <k776> ok
2011-05-09T16:11:41  <k776> What is fastest combo of browsers
2011-05-09T16:11:46  <k776> Chrome + WebDriver?
2011-05-09T16:13:48  <selbot2_> jmleyba half a minute ago - JasonLeyba: Make sure window.Function is not obfuscated by the Closure compiler. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12149
2011-05-09T16:15:39  <k776> jarib: {:text=>"log:"}
2011-05-09T16:15:39  <k776> {:text=>"log: blur"}
2011-05-09T16:15:44  <k776> So no, only FF has the bug
2011-05-09T16:15:58  *** miker2_ has joined #selenium
2011-05-09T16:16:14  <k776> It'd be really great to be able to provide the path to that executable
2011-05-09T16:16:38  <k776> Since I want to be able to include it, without having to add a dir to $PATH

2011-05-09T16:24:36  <jarib> k776: Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome.path = "/path/to/chromedriver"
2011-05-09T16:25:51  <k776> nice
2011-05-09T16:26:02  <k776> So the only bug it has then is looking for Chromium instead of Google chrome?
2011-05-09T16:26:11  <jarib> k776: i haven't done any real benchmarks, but firefox and chrome seem to be about equivalent speed-wise
2011-05-09T16:26:30  <k776> hmm, I cannot seem to get then driver setup properly 0_o  uninitialized constant Capybara::Selenium (NameError)
2011-05-09T16:26:31  <jarib> k776: i'm sure there are others, it's still quite new
2011-05-09T16:27:16  <jarib> btw, you may run into an issue with chrome autoupdating and breaking the symlinks
2011-05-09T16:27:32  <jarib> so really just easier to install Chromium for the time being
2011-05-09T16:28:07  <jarib> not sure what's up with the NameError.
2011-05-09T16:28:53  <k776> I think it's happening before capybara/selenium is initialized
2011-05-09T16:29:02  <k776> Though setting capybara confirgurations seems to work fine
2011-05-09T16:37:33  *** freynaud has joined #selenium
2011-05-09T16:40:38  <k776> grr, I can't get the Chrome one working with Capybara/Cucumber
2011-05-09T16:40:49  <k776> But I suppose this is the wrong channel to talk about that
2011-05-09T16:42:23  <jleyba> jarib: I've been bit by the prototype.js bug you hit last week twice now
2011-05-09T16:42:52  <jleyba> a) monkey-patching is evil, and b) this is a pretty big hole in our atoms strategy :(
2011-05-09T16:43:45  <k776> hmm, looks like Chrome is slower anyway: http://opinionated-programmer.com/2011/02/selenium-webdriver-firefox-vs-chrome-performance/
2011-05-09T16:43:51  <k776> So will wait for FF version to be fixed
2011-05-09T16:47:17  <jarib> k776: you'll notice the "Update" sections of that post speaks about a rewritten chrome driver
2011-05-09T16:47:33  <k776> yup, still happening?
2011-05-09T16:47:34  <k776> Or done?
2011-05-09T16:48:07  <jarib> the rewritten driver was released as part of the gem in late april
2011-05-09T16:48:20  <jarib> so the post is definitely outdated
2011-05-09T16:50:13  <jarib> jleyba: discussed it briefly with simon today, he agreed that we should go for the compiler flag to disable the native array prototype functions
2011-05-09T16:51:18  <jarib> re big hole; sort of encouraging that we didn't discover it before
2011-05-09T16:51:39  <jarib> just in this rare webkit-only edge case
2011-05-09T16:51:53  <jarib> i do see your point, though..
