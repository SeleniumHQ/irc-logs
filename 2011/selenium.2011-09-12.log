2011-09-12T05:41:35  <Roacer> I do a click on a button, this buttons calls the js that sets the cookie
2011-09-12T05:42:06  <Roacer> afterwards I have a "waitForCookieByName" with target "sn" (name of the cookie)
2011-09-12T05:42:13  <Roacer> that one times out
2011-09-12T05:42:14  <simonstewart> My reading of the source suggests that if getCookieByName passes then verifyCookieByName will also pass
2011-09-12T05:42:46  <Roacer> verifyCookieByName afterwards works, but only due to the timeout delay

2011-09-12T05:46:42  <simonstewart> selenium.getAttribute("locator@href") will get the href

2011-09-12T06:03:07  <tokstolle> hello, is it possible to use ssl certs with htmlUnit webdriver?
2011-09-12T06:03:45  <tokstolle> so far it works with a firefox driver because ff has certificates in its profile
2011-09-12T06:04:07  <tokstolle> but who to do this with htmlUnit driver?

For the synthetic mouse, take into account the current page's scroll offset. The usage of the accessibility API was removed from the coordinates calculation for native mouse movement, as it is inconsistent across platforms and yields the wrong results in some cases. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13829

2011-09-12T07:14:00  <eranm> which means it should work better on OS X. Some things will still not be entirely accurate (triggering of style changes, for example) but it should fire the right mouse events.

2011-09-12T07:32:28  <jimevans> i just find that people tend to make such comments in open-source projects without (1) ever having met anyone who actually worked on Windows, and (2) realizing that someone who worked on it may participate in their community.
2011-09-12T07:33:25  <RossPatterson> Or (3) realizing that their personal bias is not rooted in fact.
2011-09-12T07:33:56  <bracki> no matter what I try the capability is never granted.
2011-09-12T07:34:02  <RossPatterson> Windows, especially later Server versions, is actually a very sophisticated OS.  Just one that a lot of Open Source zealots don't like to work with.
2011-09-12T07:34:05  <jimevans> plus, we want to encourage MSFT participation with Selenium, and Windows-hostility, whether actual or perceived, whether joking or serious, is probably not conducive to that.
2011-09-12T07:34:28  <lord1234> cuz perhaps then IE would support Xpath better
2011-09-12T07:34:47  <Roacer> I am really sorry, did't want to start a little flamewar

2011-09-12T07:35:25  <Roacer> I just don't like "using" windows, and I have to agree, the later server versions are nice, actually I even liked NT 4 :D
2011-09-12T07:35:28  <RossPatterson> No prob.
2011-09-12T07:35:33  <lord1234> jim...wasn't xpath MS's idea to begin with?
2011-09-12T07:36:03  <lord1234> Roacer: many of us have used and will continue to use the MS offerings.  In fact there are many who argue that Apple is more of an evil empire now then MS ever was.

2011-09-12T07:38:13  <Roacer> but I am using a mac here at work, cause a linux desktop tends to be more hassle
2011-09-12T07:38:21  <lord1234> and I'm on Win7
2011-09-12T07:38:27  <RossPatterson> Several Microsoft researchers were part of the team that proposed XSL to the W3C, and from whence XPath arose.  But it wasn't a Microsoft proposal.
2011-09-12T07:38:28  <lord1234> cuz mac and linux seem like more hassle to me then windows

2011-09-12T08:02:58  <eranm> Some elements in Firefox on Windows are slightly bigger than on Linux

2011-09-12T08:14:29  <RossPatterson> lord1234: That depends on the XPath level in the code.  XPath 2.0 added the matches() function, but I don't think it is supported in all browsers.

2011-09-12T08:21:34  <lord1234> so it would be //option[matches() = "lord12*4"] ?

2011-09-12T08:38:09  <arnlaugsson_> Has anyone appended a screenshot function for failing tests (exception handling) using python and selenium 2? I have a working screenshot handling on errors, but I find it to be a ugly solution to have a try catch clause for every test and re-throwing the error. Any suggestions how to integrate it into the existing exception handling?
2011-09-12T08:38:33  <Dude-X> i am trying to get firebug loaded in firefox in java Webdriver. I get an error stating that install.rdf is not found. I'm using a custom profile, where should install.rdf be located?
2011-09-12T08:46:29  <eranm> Dude-X,  FirefoxProfile.addExtension is much less of a hassle
2011-09-12T08:47:26  <arnlaugsson_> perhaps this is more of a python question that selenium.. :) I guess it is just a question of adding an exception class that wraps this and just takes a print screen before re-throwing the error.
2011-09-12T08:47:35  <arnlaugsson_> I'll try that.
2011-09-12T08:47:53  <Dude-X> eranm: i am using that : i have: profile.addExtension(profilePath + "firebug-1.7.3.xpi")
2011-09-12T08:48:02  <Dude-X> i get an exception stating that "install.rdf" is not found
2011-09-12T08:48:51  <eranm> where does profilePath come from? Are you creating a new FirefoxProfile object or do you have a directory on disk that you point your FirefoxProfile instance to?

2011-09-12T11:01:50  <jqp> lukeis: i could probably rewrite the application code to expose a different selector hooks for this set of elements, but does this seem like a bug in selenium/web driver?
2011-09-12T11:02:47  <jqp> $('span[name="foo_1"]').html() returns the expected content from IE9's console, so it doesn't seem like this is a browser bug
2011-09-12T11:02:50  <lukeis> jqp: not sure... maybe a bug in the underlying xpath locator library that is used... but ie9 might be dropping the invalid attribute from the element
2011-09-12T11:02:59  <lukeis> that's using jquery though
2011-09-12T11:03:25  <KBM> anyone here use testmaker?

2011-09-12T11:43:06  <lord1234> hi question, I have a frame inside my window, that when scrolled through changes the HTML(or thats what I can see based on firefox).  how would one get all possible elements inside that frame?
2011-09-12T11:43:08  <lukeis> berrada Ajay: looks like the DesiredCapabilities in java is setting the platform incorrectly for Android... passing "ANDROID" instead of "LINUX" to grid / remote... guess this only comes a problem when trying to use grid w/ android  (see recent conversation on mailing list... http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users/browse_thread/thread/da892c797ad15f79/9f7acb328921ea49) ... correct me if I'm wrong, think i'll log an issue

2011-09-12T11:46:34  <lord1234> i mean just do an action?
2011-09-12T11:46:40  <lukeis> can you try javascript... window.scrollTo(x)
2011-09-12T11:46:50  <lord1234> no its not a full window frame.
2011-09-12T11:46:51  <lukeis> or an action
2011-09-12T11:47:00  <lukeis> frames are windows ;)

2011-09-12T13:14:01  <selbot2_> luke.semerau@gmail.com half a minute ago - LukeIS: updating copyright date to 2011 in docs - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13833
2011-09-12T13:16:59  <lukeis> that really should be dynamic.... don't want to have to remember to do that next year ;)
2011-09-12T13:17:01  <nirvdrum> I'm not a copyright expert, but shouldn't that be a year range?
2011-09-12T13:17:32  <lukeis> .... do we need a copyright for our docs site?

2011-09-12T13:19:00  <lukeis> i think latest year is valid... old years just mean that from that timestamp till +30 or 40 years it becomes public domain... most other (big) sites just use current year

2011-09-12T13:19:48  <selbot> New news from builds: WEB-SEHQ-228 was SUCCESSFUL : Updated by luke.semerau@gmail.com <http://xserve.openqa.org:8085/browse/WEB-SEHQ-228>
2011-09-12T13:22:18  <lukeis> funny... the news sites (where copyright is cared for more) just use current year... but ebay and amazon use the range... to show how long they've been alive or something? ;)
2011-09-12T13:22:31  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-09-12T13:23:16  <Ajay> apache uses range
2011-09-12T13:24:13  <Ajay> the main page uses just the current year
2011-09-12T13:24:28  <Ajay> and the sub project pages uses range :)

2011-09-12T14:41:32  <nirvdrum> lukeis: Yeah, I think most other sites actually get it wrong.  Usually it's just some web dev that puts a dynamically generated value in the footer :-P  Although IANAL, I'm pretty sure you need to specify the date the work was created, thus the year range.
2011-09-12T14:41:47  <nirvdrum> You're also only supposed to update the date if the page was actually modified during that timeframe.
2011-09-12T14:42:02  <nirvdrum> But, so be it.
2011-09-12T14:42:28  <lukeis> nirvdrum: I don't mind putting the range... what year did sehq start? :)
2011-09-12T14:42:49  <nirvdrum> It's kind of a moot point anyway.  Unless you file with the US copyright office, it's extremely hard to press for copyright infringement.
2011-09-12T14:42:56  <nirvdrum> (Guess who got screwed by this once :-P)
2011-09-12T14:43:08  <nirvdrum> Alas, I'm not sure.  I'd have to take a look at the SVN log.
2011-09-12T14:43:21  <lukeis> isn't it pre-svn?

2011-09-12T14:45:01  <nirvdrum> It was SVN before that, too, I'm pretty sure.
