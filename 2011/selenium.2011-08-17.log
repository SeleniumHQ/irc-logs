2011-08-17T01:46:50  <AutomatedTester> if not, could you please run the linux tests?
2011-08-17T01:47:08  <AutomatedTester> eranm: Simon said you would be gracious enough to do that :)
2011-08-17T01:47:13  <eranm> Will do

2011-08-17T01:53:42  <AutomatedTester> eranm: can it be done this morning?
2011-08-17T01:53:49  <eranm> Yes
2011-08-17T01:54:06  <eranm> Actually it's only affecting the IE driver
2011-08-17T01:54:12  <AutomatedTester> does it require other language bindings to do stuff?
2011-08-17T01:54:40  <eranm> No

2011-08-17T05:45:34  <lord1234_> krosenvold1: what do u mean by raw downloads?
2011-08-17T05:45:39  <lord1234_> the screenscrape of the page?
2011-08-17T05:45:42  <lord1234_> or are you downloading files?
2011-08-17T05:46:09  <krosenvold1> The selenium build downloads some SDKs from mozilla
2011-08-17T05:46:20  <lord1234_> oh ok
2011-08-17T05:46:30  <krosenvold1> And when I check out a tag to release maven I always use a distinct "release" user.
2011-08-17T05:46:43  <krosenvold1> So I get to download the internet all the time.
2011-08-17T05:47:12  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold1: i believe if you have it in 3rd party then you dont have to worry
2011-08-17T05:47:40  <krosenvold1> AutomatedTester: I don't because I have a clean checkout
2011-08-17T05:47:53  <krosenvold1> And all these manual steps are a hassle
2011-08-17T05:48:01  <AutomatedTester> krosenvold1: not in any of your other checkouts?
2011-08-17T05:48:18  <krosenvold1> Probably yes, but are they the right versions ?
2011-08-17T05:48:40  <AutomatedTester> if you downloaded them then probably
2011-08-17T05:48:57  <krosenvold1> The script does it all automatically
2011-08-17T05:49:09  <AutomatedTester> or are you meaning we need our own versions on a server somewhere?
2011-08-17T05:49:21  <krosenvold1> AutomatedTester: Yes, but I'd also like a local cache
2011-08-17T05:49:27  <jarib> krosenvold: do you regularly do clean checkouts on the same machine?
2011-08-17T05:49:32  <krosenvold1> Yes
2011-08-17T05:49:38  <jarib> why?
2011-08-17T05:49:45  <krosenvold1> Because I want to publish to maven central

2011-08-17T05:50:46  <jarib> so you want the downloads cached in a ~/.crazyfun folder? :)
2011-08-17T05:51:01  <jarib> i'm not sure simon is going to like this :P
2011-08-17T05:51:04  <krosenvold1> Yes please;) MAybe add md5 to the downloads  file

2011-08-17T05:52:25  <krosenvold1> Yes, I can see simon throwing a fit as cfb starts looking more & more like maven ;)
2011-08-17T05:53:06  *** dave_miles has quit IRC
2011-08-17T05:53:24  <krosenvold1> And, as an example, the mozilla sdks we used 2 releases ago are no longer available for download. Which means we can't really reconstruct an old version.
2011-08-17T05:53:38  * krosenvold1 is unsure if we need to solve that one
2011-08-17T05:53:58  *** brettporter has quit IRC
2011-08-17T05:55:24  <krosenvold1> But alternately I can really easily end up copying an old/incorrect version of the mozilla sdk's to a new release

2011-08-17T05:58:20  <eranm> What we'd really want is that this binary component will be unnecessary - either because Firefox exposes the ability to send native events through an XPCOM component or because WebDriver support will be built in
2011-08-17T05:58:52  <krosenvold1> certainly, and in the meantime I'd just like to have a half-decent shot at making consistently correct releases ;)

2011-08-17T06:00:23  <eranm> I agree, it'd be a good idea to use cached downloads somehow
2011-08-17T06:01:08  <eranm> after all, the build system already expects the Android SDK  in '../android_sdk' which it outside the build tree.

2011-08-17T06:29:37  <AutomatedTester> but when my tests passed I was happy
2011-08-17T06:32:13  <eranm> getLocation is a very fundamental method, making the change there is too invasive (other code relies on getting the whole client rectangle)

2011-08-17T06:33:00  <jarib> eranm: looks like the 1.9.2 SDKs have disappeared? http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/
2011-08-17T06:33:02  <eranm> But such a change can go into click
2011-08-17T06:33:29  <eranm> jarib, I take them from here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko_SDK
2011-08-17T06:34:31  <eranm> In the case of 1.9.2 SDKs they live under '3.6.20', not the Gecko SDK version
2011-08-17T06:35:43  <jarib> ah, so the URL in the Rakefile is wrong
2011-08-17T06:36:34  <jarib> third_party/gecko-1.9.2 should really point to http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/3.6.20/sdk/xulrunner-3.6.20.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2 ?
2011-08-17T06:36:57  <AutomatedTester> eranm: so if I move that code into click, would that be better?
2011-08-17T06:37:37  <jarib> i also noticed we only download 1.9.2 for 32-bit linux
2011-08-17T06:38:01  <adamgoucher> ha! from twitter. 'The 11 in C++11 refers to the number of legs that have now been nailed onto the dog whilst attempting to build a better octopus.'
2011-08-17T06:38:56  <eranm> jarib,  the first Firefox version to officially support 64-bit is 4
2011-08-17T06:39:37  <jarib> ah, that's true
2011-08-17T06:39:56  <jarib> but why not mac/win?
2011-08-17T06:40:31  <eranm> For windows there's no separate 32/64 bit sdk
2011-08-17T06:41:38  <eranm> And since the native components do not work on Mac, the only reason to have the Gecko SDK on Mac is to compile the interfaces. That can be done with any Gecko SDK version and that probably won't matter much which (we default to version 2 for this)
2011-08-17T06:44:02  <eranm> AutomatedTester, it'd still be problematic in click - this is the code path used for clicking SVG elements, for example
2011-08-17T06:44:21  <eranm> I'm not sure about the solution myself
2011-08-17T06:44:54  <AutomatedTester> who cares about SVG
2011-08-17T06:44:57  <eranm> but one thing to try is to call elementFromPoint with the middle of the element and if we get the body / some other element, then pick the first rectangle.

2011-08-17T07:28:59  <crash82> Hello, I'm trying to use selenium ide to match this case id="a0idcontaservico135769" I whant to match id=a0idcontaservico* , but the target isn't found. any tips?
2011-08-17T07:30:02  <lord1234_> ummm
2011-08-17T07:30:07  <lord1234_> are there multiple id's that match that *?
2011-08-17T07:30:13  <lord1234_> also, you can't wildcard that way
2011-08-17T07:31:02  <crash82> this is the only ID like this, I tryed using //a[contains(@href, '*?accao=seleccionar&idcontaservico=*')]
2011-08-17T07:31:08  <crash82> also didn't work

2011-08-17T07:47:24  <lord1234_> firefox 6.0+build1+nobinonly-ubuntu0.10.04.1~mfs1 is what synaptic says
2011-08-17T07:49:20  <selbot2> eran.mes@gmail.com less than a minute ago - EranMes, on behalf of KenKania: Add getPageZoom Chrome-specific js atom and not trimming the result of getLocationInView. - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=13412
2011-08-17T07:50:19  <eranm> I'd suggest trying with 'vanilla' Firefox from mozilla.org
2011-08-17T07:50:52  <eranm> The only other reason I've seen for Firefox crashing is that it's running inside Xvnc and sometimes, Xvnc itself will crash, taking Firefox with it
2011-08-17T07:51:10  <lord1234_> ...i.t is running isde of vncserver
2011-08-17T07:51:22  <lord1234_> but the server stays up the entire time(i'm watchign firefox randomly shutdown mid-test)
2011-08-17T07:51:25  <eranm> (The first reason being binary incompatibility between WebDriver's binary components and the version on Firefox you have)

2011-08-17T09:01:58  <eranm> barancev, this element should be handled by the WebElementToJsonConverter. The real question is why it isn't.
2011-08-17T09:02:51  <barancev> eranm: look at the EventFiringWebElement constuctor
2011-08-17T09:03:01  <barancev> it creates a proxy, no-name class
2011-08-17T09:03:23  <AutomatedTester> eranm: I think my original code wasnt far off
2011-08-17T09:03:34  <AutomatedTester> I have fixed it, have a native event test failing
2011-08-17T09:03:43  <barancev> WebElementToJsonConverter can't work with it by name, only via interfaces that are implementd by the Proxy
2011-08-17T09:04:00  <AutomatedTester> testShouldFireClickEventWhenClicking
2011-08-17T09:04:05  <AutomatedTester> it caused an error
2011-08-17T09:04:08  <barancev> so, it _should_ implement WrapsElement
2011-08-17T09:04:32  <eranm> I see
2011-08-17T09:07:01  <AutomatedTester> eranm: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1302637 works now
2011-08-17T09:07:10  <eranm> barancev, the problem is that the RemoteWebElement is not an interface, it's an actual class. If it was an interface, then the WebElementToJsonConverter would have handled it
2011-08-17T09:07:38  <AutomatedTester> i ran all the tests on Linux and all passed except testShouldFireClickEventWhenClicking

2011-08-17T09:10:30  <barancev> eranm: WebElementToJsonConverter obtains as a parameter neither a RemoteWebElement, nor an EventFiringWebElement, but a Proxy object created in EventFiringWebElement constuctor. that's how it is implemented :) may be it is not the best solution, but I have no authority to change it
2011-08-17T09:11:42  <barancev> at the same time, there is a simple solution - let the Proxy object implement all the interfaces to look like a real WebElement
2011-08-17T09:11:48  <eranm> barancev, exactly. In a sense, the element sent to the listener is incomplete
2011-08-17T09:12:55  <barancev> eranm: yes, I agree, it is incomplete, it wraps a real element, but it does not implement WrapsElement, so nobody can access this locked element
2011-08-17T09:13:47  <barancev> that's what my patch does -- it adds an interface and a method to the Proxy
2011-08-17T09:14:23  <eranm> That's simple enough, what I'm trying to find out is why do we need this proxy in the first place
2011-08-17T09:14:49  <barancev> eranm: yes, I was thrilled too :)

2011-08-17T09:19:45  <simonstewart> How're things?
2011-08-17T09:19:59  <eranm> Not bad.  A flurry of fixes have gone in while you were asleep
2011-08-17T09:20:15  <simonstewart> Exciting
2011-08-17T09:20:19  <simonstewart> Anything important?
2011-08-17T09:20:25  <eranm> And we could use your help in solving a mystery: in EventFiringWebElement, why do we need the proxy element?
2011-08-17T09:20:42  <eranm> (the alternative would be to always use the underlyingElement)
2011-08-17T09:20:56  <eranm> Native events for Firefox 6, the usual stuff.
2011-08-17T09:21:06  <simonstewart> The proxy is the thing that has the listeners attached to it
2011-08-17T09:21:10  *** Ajay has joined #selenium
2011-08-17T09:21:27  <barancev> I've changed it to use the underlying element -- all the tests in EventFiringWebDriverTest passed
2011-08-17T09:21:36  <simonstewart> Line 306 in EventFiringWebDriver is the interesting one
2011-08-17T09:22:22  <simonstewart> If you do that, then you lose the "onException" calls when an exception is thrown
2011-08-17T09:22:26  <eranm> I see
2011-08-17T09:22:30  <simonstewart> We should probably write a test for that
2011-08-17T09:22:35  <eranm> The alternative would be to try/catch in every method
2011-08-17T09:22:39  <simonstewart> Right
2011-08-17T09:22:41  <simonstewart> Which is fugly
2011-08-17T09:22:53  <simonstewart> More importantly: why does the fact that it's a proxy matter?
2011-08-17T09:23:06  <eranm> The problem with this proxy object is that it's not serializable by the WebElementToJsonConverter

2011-08-17T09:23:21  <simonstewart> Then make it implement "WrapsElement"
2011-08-17T09:23:25  <eranm> barancev's solution was to add the WrapsElement interface to the list of interfaces supported
2011-08-17T09:23:27  <mydog2> hi.. can someone provide clarity for selectByVisibleText << i have a select/option list that i can find the select "id" of.. but the option list isn't displayed in the source code.. however, i do know the value/text for the option list from looking at firebug..

2011-08-17T09:23:39  <simonstewart> barancev's solution looks like the right one to me
2011-08-17T09:23:54  <eranm> But then it's necessary to special-case the 'getWrappedElement' method and return the real, underlying one.

2011-08-17T09:24:11  <simonstewart> Which I believe the converter already handles

2011-08-17T09:24:42  <eranm> I was trying to solve this issue by removing code rather than adding. Ah well.
2011-08-17T09:25:02  <simonstewart> If you remove the proxy you'll end up adding a ton of try/catch blocks, all identical

2011-08-17T11:49:25  <lukeis> ok... well, i just lost 1/3 of my plugins on one of my machines cause of the last update :)

2011-08-17T11:49:54  <Ajay__> lukeis: change the max version in the install.rdf of the plugins
2011-08-17T11:50:00  <Ajay__> it might work
2011-08-17T11:50:02  <mydog2> i can paste my short test code..
2011-08-17T11:50:09  <lukeis> eh, i didn't mind losing them ;)
2011-08-17T11:50:12  <mydog2> but this is a pain!
2011-08-17T11:50:12  <AutomatedTester> lukeis: if those addons were available from AMO, we auto bump the max version
2011-08-17T11:50:13  <ebass> mydog2, I am not sure why that wouldn't work.  Have you tried moving the mouse over the element and clicking it using the Actions object?

2011-08-17T13:06:29  <jarib> BenGrailsGuy: my point is there's no generic solution. webdriver can wait up until a point, but if the page has the equivalent of <body onload="setTimeout(buildThePage, 1000)">, we'll just be guessing at that point
2011-08-17T13:07:07  <jarib> so usually i wait for specific elements to be visible that indicates this particular page is loaded
2011-08-17T13:07:18  <jarib> usually the elements i want to interact with
2011-08-17T13:07:24  <jarib> (which is what i'd do when testing manually)
2011-08-17T13:07:31  <simonstewart> Anyone here know of a good sample set of tests using maven I can try to find out whether 2.4 is any good before pushing?
2011-08-17T13:08:17  <BenGrailsGuy> oh, darn, that's a downfall of selenium then. But I can see how you are right, I really don't know how there would be a set way of determining if the page has loaded
2011-08-17T13:08:45  <rmcauley1> (shameless copy/paste) hey jarib, how do I select a frame in ruby/selenium-webdriver?

2011-08-17T13:10:52  <rmcauley1> and some_frame should be formatted "name=[something]" or "id=[something]" or "relative=top"?
2011-08-17T13:11:24  <lukeis> it's usually the frame webelement (in other bindings)

2011-08-17T13:12:12  <lukeis> driver.switch_to.frame(driver.find_element(By.ID, "someid"))   ... looks a bit like ruby, but is actually python ;)

2011-08-17T13:32:35  <adamgoucher> reading the code, it 'looks' right, but there are enough reports of it being busted to think it is :)
2011-08-17T13:37:01  <adamgoucher> ah-ha! the reason why timeouts are in msâ¦ new Date().getTime() > timeoutTime. and timeouttime is a getTime() + parseInt() of your timeout value

2011-08-17T13:42:45  <dawagner> If you change what is selected, and then go to the URL bar and press enter again, that option is selected.

2011-08-17T14:07:29  <AutomatedTester> a company are asking for commercial support for Selenium to get bugs prioritised and fixed
2011-08-17T14:07:39  <AutomatedTester> willing to pay cash money
2011-08-17T14:07:56  <simonstewart> My contract with google doesn't allow me to do that

2011-08-17T14:08:12  <simonstewart> (would need to read and check)
2011-08-17T14:08:34  <AutomatedTester> my thought was that we could do it but the project decides on a charity of the month and they have to give money to them
2011-08-17T14:08:41  <AutomatedTester> if we did do that
2011-08-17T14:08:47  <simonstewart> That'd be a nice thing to do

2011-08-17T14:09:35  <jarib> do they say what bugs they want to see fixed?

2011-08-17T15:55:28  <lukeis> so, i'm asking this because potentially (depending on how mean your UI guys decided to be) the onclick or onWhatever can be over-ridden by javascript elsewhere ;)
2011-08-17T15:55:50  <sfbrian> does webdriver have a blur function like selenium rc does?
2011-08-17T15:56:14  <lukeis> blur usually means focusing on another item
2011-08-17T15:56:25  <lukeis> webdriver doesn't have an explicit blur
2011-08-17T15:57:36  *** QAGuy has quit IRC
2011-08-17T15:58:51  <lukeis> but you can do it in a few ways... if you want to just "blur"  then with most elements you should be able to do it with javascript -   executeScript("arguments[0].blur()", webElement)   ~ but that doesn't work always, i would suggest moving to (Actions class) or clicking on another element.
2011-08-17T15:59:23  <wanderso> Speaking of blur functions, does IE9 in Selenium 1 support selenium.fireEvent?

2011-08-17T16:19:32  <autojack> I need to have Selenium load a page, and then see a list of all http requests that were made (like to load images, etc). one way I can see to do this is via a pass-through proxy server. is there anything else I might want to consider?

2011-08-17T16:22:49  <lukeis> mydog2: maybe would be helpful... so I see the frame updates with a spinner and then loads the content, are you waiting for that to finish?

2011-08-17T16:25:46  <lukeis> autojack: I haven't had to do that before... but proxy would be one way, or if you can find a firefox plugin that has some sort of api to get that info (or write a ff plugin)

2011-08-17T16:26:15  <mydog2> feel free to change what i have..
2011-08-17T16:26:54  <autojack> lukeis: yeah, writing a FF plugin is probably beyond me :)  and I'm not sure how Selenium would access a plugin's API.
2011-08-17T16:27:10  <autojack> I suppose I could just fire arbitrary js and capture the result, if that worked.
2011-08-17T16:27:14  <lukeis> autojack: through javascript
2011-08-17T16:27:18  <autojack> nod
2011-08-17T16:27:22  <autojack> makes sense.
2011-08-17T16:27:38  <autojack> if I can find the right plugin, that might be easier than the proxy approach.
2011-08-17T16:27:51  <lukeis> would agree... sadly i don't know of one...
2011-08-17T16:28:02  <autojack> I'll look.
2011-08-17T16:28:03  <lukeis> mydog2: i see your issue, you're not switching to the frame
2011-08-17T16:29:32  <mydog2> I thought when I got the src of the frame. and did the click on that.. that I would have the frame..  within the browser.. i see that the term frame/select is on the page..
2011-08-17T16:30:09  <lukeis> yeah, you can get / interact with elements in frames but to get it's source and to have a proper effect you should switch to it
2011-08-17T16:31:56  <lukeis> let me get you a paste of what I did...

2011-08-17T17:37:32  <Mayank> wanderso: if you are free, ^
2011-08-17T17:37:46  <wanderso> Define "can be clicked".
2011-08-17T17:38:46  <Mayank> like - if you hover on the element the cursor changes to "hand" instead of the regular "pointer" - best way i could define it
2011-08-17T17:38:56  *** stephend has quit IRC
2011-08-17T17:39:23  <Mayank> wanderso: ^
2011-08-17T17:39:35  <wanderso> Um... I would have no idea. That sounds worryingly browser-specific.
2011-08-17T17:39:46  <mydog2> hey lukeis... still doesn't get me the depts..
2011-08-17T17:39:55  <wanderso> If there's a flag you can add or remove to an element to make it "hand"able, then you could test for the presence of that flag.
2011-08-17T17:40:37  <Mayank> wanderso: No flag actually. This element can be detected by CSS change
2011-08-17T17:41:00  <Mayank> i mean the click can be *
2011-08-17T17:41:13  <wanderso> I wouldn't know, then. Sorry.

2011-08-17T17:52:12  <dawagner> Mayank: Are you looking to check whether an email will throw if you try to click it, or whether clicking on it will actually do anything?
2011-08-17T17:52:46  <dawagner> Also, to detect whether an alert is present: driver.switchTo().alert() should throw if one is not present, or return an alert if one is present
2011-08-17T17:53:44  <dawagner> The workaround you describe ^^ is *definitely* not supported
2011-08-17T17:53:56  <dawagner> (And probably only works in firefox at the moment, and that's an accident)
2011-08-17T17:58:01  <Mayank> dawagner: Yes, just tested in IE, it does not work. Will add a try catch block then! thanks!

2011-08-17T20:35:59  <mydog2> hey lukeis !!! of course i'm on this!!
2011-08-17T20:36:16  <mydog2> i tried what you stated... didn't get the depts..
2011-08-17T20:36:26  <mydog2> let's see what you want me to try...
2011-08-17T20:36:33  <mydog2> i'll owe you on this!!
2011-08-17T20:36:55  <lukeis> you have a lovely .net application that is doing some ajax... need to wait for the ajax operation to complete after changing the select before you can click the go button
2011-08-17T20:36:58  <mydog2> checking it now..
2011-08-17T20:37:26  <mydog2> how the heck did you figure that??
2011-08-17T20:38:25  <lukeis> well, i used to work on .net... but also i saw that spinner after changing the select and saw it had an onchange
2011-08-17T20:38:46  <lukeis> i first put a small sleep in there, but figured i could find the real state change that it was waiting for
2011-08-17T20:39:24  <lukeis> so the key things in there are the first thing I do to the driver... implicitlyWait  and then that WebDriverWait
2011-08-17T20:40:22  <mydog2> ok.. on the .net..
2011-08-17T20:40:45  <mydog2> ok.. so i need to read up on the waits..
2011-08-17T20:41:02  <mydog2> what's the apply??
2011-08-17T20:41:03  <lukeis> http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html#explicit-and-implicit-waits
2011-08-17T20:41:35  <lukeis> apply is the method you have to implement for the ExpectedCondition class
2011-08-17T20:41:57  <lukeis> it gets called every 1/2 second to verify whatever condition you want to meet
2011-08-17T20:42:08  <lukeis> in your case i'm waiting for the spinner to disappear
2011-08-17T20:42:57  <mydog2> ok...
2011-08-17T20:43:01  <mydog2> are you in the us?
2011-08-17T20:43:04  <lukeis> sf

2011-08-17T20:47:45  <mydog2> cool... the 4743. is that for the course number?
2011-08-17T20:48:22  <lukeis> yeah... i just did that as a sample for you
2011-08-17T20:48:30  <lukeis> didn't know where you wanted to go from there...
2011-08-17T20:49:49  <mydog2> ao what's the apply for?
2011-08-17T20:49:53  <mydog2> so..
2011-08-17T20:50:19  <lukeis> it's the method that gets applied while waiting
2011-08-17T20:50:45  <mydog2> hmm... are you familiar eith htmlunit?
2011-08-17T20:50:47  <lukeis> if the method generic is a boolean, it keeps retrying until the timeout every 500ms  if the return is false
2011-08-17T20:50:49  <mydog2> with
2011-08-17T20:50:50  <lukeis> yes
2011-08-17T20:51:06  <mydog2> can this be accomplished using htmlunit?
2011-08-17T20:51:18  <lukeis> on a site like that, it won't work well... htmlunit doesn't do well with heavy javascript
2011-08-17T20:52:03  <mydog2> the crawler i'm working on.. will have to parse a number of sites..
2011-08-17T20:52:26  <mydog2> and the lighter the client fetch processes, the better..
2011-08-17T20:52:43  <mydog2> i was hoping for a completely headless solution..
2011-08-17T20:52:52  <lukeis> email me and I can send you a generic crawler i wrote with htmlunit... multithreaded etc...
2011-08-17T20:52:57  <lukeis> (tomorrow)
