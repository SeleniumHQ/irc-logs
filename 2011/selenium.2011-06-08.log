2011-06-08T02:04:12  <jarib> Binken: you can keep using the actions interface before you call .Build().Perform()
2011-06-08T02:04:40  <Binken> What do you mean to keep using the actions?
2011-06-08T02:05:11  <Binken> If I do not use the build and perform, the hover action will not implent

2011-06-08T02:07:05  <Binken> Yeah, I see this
2011-06-08T02:07:06  <jarib> it's a builder, it's rarely used to perform a single action
2011-06-08T02:08:07  <Binken> The issue for now is the MovetoElment only last brief time
2011-06-08T02:08:53  <jarib> i think that's a known bug, that it depends on where your actual mouse cursor is
2011-06-08T02:09:18  <Binken> I move the cursor out of the window, Still can not work
2011-06-08T02:09:44  <Binken> I see the similar issue in the Google group

2011-06-08T02:11:05  <yaf> for select_window_ok is there the possibility to select the window with xpath?
2011-06-08T02:11:40  <Binken> Yaf ,No
2011-06-08T02:12:32  <yaf> how can i select a popup window (from javascript)
2011-06-08T02:13:44  <Binken> you can user the             driver.SwitchTo().Window()
2011-06-08T02:14:10  <yaf> it's java, isn't it?
2011-06-08T02:14:25  <yaf> i'm using perl
2011-06-08T02:14:26  <Binken> yes, you can use java
2011-06-08T02:14:30  <jarib> select_window_ok is Selenium 1 / RC
2011-06-08T02:14:44  <jarib> while SwitchTo().Window() is Selenium 2 / WebDriver
2011-06-08T02:14:55  *** Binken has quit IRC
2011-06-08T02:15:03  <yaf> no it's sel2
2011-06-08T02:15:19  <yaf> it's from selenium ide
2011-06-08T02:15:20  <jarib> well it's the RC vs the WebDriver API
2011-06-08T02:15:38  <jarib> so you're talking about two different technologies
2011-06-08T02:15:46  <jarib> i'm not sure how you'd do it with RC
2011-06-08T02:17:11  <yaf> hm ok, i don't understand it right now
2011-06-08T02:17:30  <yaf> i have the selenium rc on a linux server installed
2011-06-08T02:17:43  <yaf> create perl-tests with selenium ide
2011-06-08T02:18:15  <yaf> and run this tests on units under tests against the rc
2011-06-08T02:18:20  <yaf> is it right?
2011-06-08T02:18:45  <yaf> i'm using selenium ide only to get the perl-code for tests
2011-06-08T02:19:50  <yaf> is it the correct way?
2011-06-08T02:21:21  <AutomatedTester> yaf: there should be a selectWindow or selectPop method
2011-06-08T02:21:32  <AutomatedTester> selectPopup
2011-06-08T02:22:16  <yaf> yes select_window_ok exists, but i don't know how to get the windowname
2011-06-08T02:22:53  <AutomatedTester> is it a popup or a window
2011-06-08T02:22:58  <AutomatedTester> they are different...
2011-06-08T02:23:00  <yaf> a popup
2011-06-08T02:23:38  <yaf> javascript
2011-06-08T02:24:02  <AutomatedTester> so there is a different browser window available?
2011-06-08T02:25:07  <AutomatedTester> yaf: does the javascript have a window name in the code creating the popup?
2011-06-08T02:25:21  <AutomatedTester> you may need to scrape that and then work it out
2011-06-08T02:25:47  <yaf> no there is no window name only the DOM is available
2011-06-08T02:26:19  <yaf> can i select the popup with a DOM Naming?
2011-06-08T02:26:34  <yaf> resp. the elements in the popup
2011-06-08T02:26:41  <AutomatedTester> what do you mean the DOM is available?
2011-06-08T02:26:44  *** vrockai_ has joined #selenium
2011-06-08T02:26:50  <AutomatedTester> is there another browser window or not?
2011-06-08T02:27:08  <yaf> no only 1 browserwindow
2011-06-08T02:27:29  <AutomatedTester> ok... so you dont need to "move" to that  popup
2011-06-08T02:27:48  <AutomatedTester> its just a DIV so you need to wait for it to appear and then carry on
2011-06-08T02:27:57  <yaf> no it's in the middle of the mainwindow
2011-06-08T02:28:19  <yaf> ok yes it's a div that's right
2011-06-08T02:29:55  <yaf> how can i wait for the div? wait_for_page_to_load_ok does not work (it seems to be only for the mainwindow)
2011-06-08T02:31:11  <yaf> should i use waitforpopup?
2011-06-08T02:40:33  <AutomatedTester> yaf: you will need to write code to check its present and then catch the exception when its not and then loop round again
2011-06-08T02:42:45  <yaf> i don't know how to check the popups is present
2011-06-08T02:43:04  <yaf> i don't know the name
2011-06-08T02:44:38  <yaf> popup and div are not the same, right?
2011-06-08T02:45:06  <yaf> i have somthing like: div class="popupData"...
2011-06-08T02:46:04  <AutomatedTester> ok so a Popup is a child window of the browser
2011-06-08T02:46:16  <AutomatedTester> you kill the browser and both windows die
2011-06-08T02:46:22  <yaf> yes
2011-06-08T02:46:39  <AutomatedTester> if you have a new window, you can kill the window, the other window isnt affected
2011-06-08T02:46:52  <AutomatedTester> a div is a DOM element and isn't a popup
2011-06-08T02:47:00  <AutomatedTester> you have the last item
2011-06-08T02:47:16  <yaf> ok no popup
2011-06-08T02:47:23  <AutomatedTester> so you need to use normal element locator strategies to find it
2011-06-08T02:47:45  <yaf> but xpath=//div... does not work, it can't find the element
2011-06-08T02:48:11  <yaf> but in selenium ide the element was founded
2011-06-08T02:48:35  <yaf> only perl-modul with rc won't find
2011-06-08T02:49:05  <AutomatedTester> maybe there is a bug in the way it is translated
2011-06-08T02:49:19  <yaf> the perlmodul?
2011-06-08T02:49:34  <yaf> i installed yesterday latest perlmodul 1.25

2011-06-08T03:01:40  <__mike> Hi all : ) I want to create a custom web driver which extends ChromeDriver but overrides a few of its handlers. For example screenshot functionality. I can do this just fine locally but I'm not sure how to go about doing it on the Grid. Presumably I'd have to modify it so the new main allows my browsername as an argument. However I can see a config/driver handler. Is this for adding a new driver dynamically ? Is it documented somewhe
2011-06-08T03:05:04  <AutomatedTester> __mike: for Grid I suggest waiting for freynaud
2011-06-08T03:05:06  <yaf> AutomatedTester: do you think it does not work because the perlmodul?
2011-06-08T03:05:14  <AutomatedTester> yaf: not sure
2011-06-08T03:05:50  <yaf> what's normaly used? java? python?
2011-06-08T03:05:50  <AutomatedTester> yaf: unfortunately perl isnt supported officially by the project
2011-06-08T03:06:15  <AutomatedTester> yaf: i use python, java has a huge backing as well as ruby and .NET
2011-06-08T03:06:46  <yaf> we won't install java on the units under test, that's the reason for using perl
2011-06-08T03:07:19  <AutomatedTester> yaf: um... are you using Selenium RC?
2011-06-08T03:07:27  <yaf> yes

2011-06-08T03:54:54  <__mike> I'm not quite sure what that path you wrote is but you can identify elements by xpath with driver.findElement( By.xpath( .... ) )
2011-06-08T03:55:13  <ato> A typical XPath expression would be "//div".

2011-06-08T04:09:08  <freynaud> __mike: hello
2011-06-08T04:09:25  <freynaud> first question
2011-06-08T04:09:43  <freynaud> why do you want to extend  the driver ?
2011-06-08T04:10:17  <freynaud> then i can try to answer the grid part :)
2011-06-08T04:12:06  <__mike> I want to emulate displaying a page of a certain size in a webkit renderer (iphone size). I think the way the current ChromeDriver screenshot works is it reads from some internal buffer because what you see is different to what is returned. For example if you went to google.co.uk and made the page very small, the text at the top overlaps. If I do this, the ChromeDriver will still take a screenshot as if it were normal. It seems how i
2011-06-08T04:12:31  *** adamgoucher has joined #selenium
2011-06-08T04:12:50  <__mike> So ideally I would override ChromeDriver's screenshotting code to use PrintWindow() or BitBlt() which would return what the user actually sees at that size.
2011-06-08T04:13:17  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: do you tend to make your py.test scripts inherit from unittest.TestCase to get all their asserts -- or do you just [re]create them?
2011-06-08T04:13:30  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: i use native asserts
2011-06-08T04:13:46  <AutomatedTester> but i also created a lightweight DSL for asserts
2011-06-08T04:14:20  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: https://github.com/AutomatedTester/unittest-zero
2011-06-08T04:14:42  <AutomatedTester> its the unittest asserts without all the bloat of the runner

2011-06-08T04:16:16  <adamgoucher> hmmm. how would you work soft asserts into that?
2011-06-08T04:16:59  <AutomatedTester> try except around the Assert.* method
2011-06-08T04:17:13  <freynaud> __mike: you can overwrite the driver, but if you want to see exactly what's happening, why not using vnc on your driver for instnace
2011-06-08T04:17:38  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher like you would with unittest
2011-06-08T04:17:40  *** csanchez has quit IRC
2011-06-08T04:18:07  <adamgoucher> sure, wasnt sure if you had a nice pattern for that in unittest-zero
2011-06-08T04:18:15  <KSG> Hi, I have a requirement of selecting a button in HTML page for more that 20 sec. Can any one help me to acheive that ?
2011-06-08T04:18:17  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: we dont do soft asserts
2011-06-08T04:18:25  <freynaud> __mike: then for the grid part, it's not really grid, it's remote webdriver. If you have a ChromeMikeDriver, you need the server to recognize that, so that when it recieves a desiredcapability with browserName=chomeMike, it knows what to start
2011-06-08T04:18:42  <freynaud> grid will do the forwarding only, the logic will be in the webdriver server
2011-06-08T04:18:49  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: if you like unittestzero and want that feature raise an issue on Github
2011-06-08T04:18:53  <AutomatedTester> and I will see about adding it
2011-06-08T04:19:37  <freynaud> adamgoucher: do we have soft assert for the java version ?

2011-06-08T04:20:09  <AutomatedTester> freynaud: in RC if you inherit from SeleneseTestCase I beleive you get it
2011-06-08T04:20:24  <AutomatedTester> actually if you extend it
2011-06-08T04:20:48  <freynaud> adamgoucher: i tried with testng, but there was 1 small issue left.
2011-06-08T04:21:21  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: is sorta what i have landed with http://pastebin.com/M1M1Lx0C
2011-06-08T04:21:59  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: what are you trying to do?
2011-06-08T04:22:27  <adamgoucher> be able to have exceptions thrown and then caught during setup -- which nose doesnt allow
2011-06-08T04:22:49  <AutomatedTester> adamgoucher: i would do setup and teardown in conftest
2011-06-08T04:23:00  <AutomatedTester> and then monitor things that way

2011-06-08T04:24:20  <__mike> Yep freynaud, I understand about having to add the logic to the desiredcapability. Is there somewhere documented the different parts I'd have to change to add a new WebDriver ? I'm not quite sure what you mean by using vnc on my driver.
2011-06-08T04:24:53  <freynaud> __mike: if you want to really see what happens on the node, VNC to it
2011-06-08T04:25:09  <freynaud> you will see what it looks like, independent from any magic selenium adds
2011-06-08T04:26:08  <__mike> i have the node running locally on my machine. when a screenshot is taken on chromedriver it doesn't seem like anything happens which is what led me to believe it was using some internal dc buffer

2011-06-08T04:26:50  <freynaud> __mike: i would start with src/org/openqa/selenium/remote/server/DefaultDriverFactory.java
2011-06-08T04:26:56  <freynaud> that's where you have the mapping
2011-06-08T04:27:06  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: conftest is 'global' then? so i could have it for the things that every script needs, but then class level setup_class for the specific variations (like logging in) that they require?

2011-06-08T04:28:00  <freynaud> np
2011-06-08T04:28:31  <freynaud> __mike: but  i would really try everything else before changing the driver :)

2011-06-08T04:29:47  <__mike> well i'm sort of out of ideas and this is the last resort. i did try androiddriver but it was very very very slow and didn't load some sites but did load others. although the loading problem is more likely due to firewall/proxy issues than a problem with the driver itself.

2011-06-08T04:30:40  <freynaud> Stuk: 1) Can I launch 2 driver on the same machine and have them isolated ? at the moment I can't it listen on the same port
2011-06-08T04:31:16  <Stuk> see ato ^, we currently don't have a way to tell opera to listen on different ports
2011-06-08T04:31:29  <ato> We're working on a fix for that which will come soon, but for the time being, no, unless you inject a different port number to your operaprefs.ini file.
2011-06-08T04:31:30  <freynaud> ato: 1 per OS limit will always be there? ( aka should I hardcode instance per browser to 1 for opera )

2011-06-08T04:31:51  <freynaud> ato: ok
2011-06-08T04:32:10  <ato> I'll ping a desktop developer again to speed it up (-:
2011-06-08T04:32:21  <freynaud> also, can you have the capability returning the correct version ?
2011-06-08T04:32:54  <ato> Version of what?
2011-06-08T04:33:06  <freynaud> ato: once the port is fixed, it will be ok ? no data shared between 2 opera on 2 different port ?
2011-06-08T04:33:34  <freynaud> I'd like capability.getVersion() to return opera --version
2011-06-08T04:33:36  <ato> That's correct.  In theory it should work that way.  Desktop might behave differently than our internal builds, though, so I'll verify that.
2011-06-08T04:33:48  <selvakumar> hi
2011-06-08T04:33:50  <adamgoucher> AutomatedTester: i think switching to conftest is going to be a 'step 2'
2011-06-08T04:34:00  <freynaud> at the moment if I do a getCapability on a remote driver, i have nearly nothing
2011-06-08T04:34:14  <selvakumar> how to configure  codecoverage plugin to take my selenium test cases?
2011-06-08T04:34:15  <ato> freynaud: I'm working on exposing that now.  You'll have to ability to return the user agent string and the core version (which is not the same as the desktop version number).

2011-06-08T06:34:02  <simonstewart> go on
2011-06-08T06:34:17  <barancev> I suggested to add waitForTitleChange("Page3") to testShouldBeAbleToFindElementAfterJavascriptCausesANewPageToLoad
2011-06-08T06:34:39  <barancev> but it was wrong idea :)
2011-06-08T06:35:01  <barancev> not I think we have to remove waits from other tests :)
2011-06-08T06:35:24  <simonstewart> There's a bug filed about waits being added too enthusiastically to our tests
2011-06-08T06:37:20  <barancev> it there? but I've seen your post in google-groups and it makes me rethink
2011-06-08T06:38:12  <barancev> almost all tests in JavascriptEnabledDriverTest have wait after click
2011-06-08T06:39:43  <XCulver> i have wait after all my clicks
2011-06-08T06:39:51  <XCulver> for ie in .net
2011-06-08T06:40:01  <simonstewart> the click happens asynchronously
2011-06-08T06:40:02  <jrock20041> So I am not sure why that cast error shows up
2011-06-08T06:40:08  <simonstewart> we don't know for sure when they actually happen
2011-06-08T06:40:49  <simonstewart> the cast is being caused by _something_ coming in that doesn't implement WebElement
2011-06-08T06:41:04  *** Ziranov has quit IRC
2011-06-08T06:41:09  <simonstewart> What method are you calling on WebElement?
2011-06-08T06:41:15  <barancev> so what's the common rule about waits in tests?
2011-06-08T06:41:41  <jrock20041> So I need to check my code to see if there is anything that is using rendered webelement
2011-06-08T06:41:48  <simonstewart> right
2011-06-08T06:41:56  <jrock20041> Ok will look and let you know
2011-06-08T06:42:07  <simonstewart> the common rule? If you expect a page load from a user interaction, add a wait

2011-06-08T06:42:50  <barancev> simonstewart: I mean tests for selenium :) I can try to find and clean out all waits, if you like this idea
2011-06-08T06:43:17  <barancev> but I want to know where to stop removing them :)
2011-06-08T06:43:33  <simonstewart> They've normally ended up being added because we've noticed test instability
2011-06-08T06:44:17  <barancev> hacking tests is not the best way to make tests green :)
2011-06-08T06:44:39  <barancev> they ary lying
2011-06-08T06:44:49  <cdan> hello
2011-06-08T06:44:51  <simonstewart> There's only one place I'm aware of them lying
2011-06-08T06:45:03  <simonstewart> the nature of the interactions has shifted over time
2011-06-08T06:45:19  <simonstewart> so whereas we once implemented everything in js, quite often we now use native events
2011-06-08T06:46:56  <barancev> and with native events we have less knowledge about "to wait or not to wait"?

2011-06-08T06:48:32  <barancev> ok, then - what about JavascriptEnabledDriverTest - should this tests be driven to the same style of waits?
2011-06-08T06:48:38  <AutomatedTester> can we no longer support Maven?
2011-06-08T06:48:41  <barancev> and what style - wait or not?

2011-06-08T08:00:30  <barancev> simonstewart: then, if webdriver is async, why waitForPageToLoad does not exist anymore?
2011-06-08T08:00:52  <simonstewart> because you can't tell when a page is loaded reliably
2011-06-08T08:03:05  <simonstewart> I appear to have brought my machine to its knees
2011-06-08T08:03:09  <barancev> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#Q:_fails_to_find_elements_/_Does_not_block_on_page_loads
2011-06-08T08:03:09  <simonstewart> Oh well
2011-06-08T08:03:23  <barancev> "WebDriver has a blocking API, generally."
2011-06-08T08:03:41  <simonstewart> The interactions api isn't blocking
2011-06-08T08:03:51  <simonstewart> but when we detect that a page is loading we do rty and block
2011-06-08T08:04:14  <simonstewart> so, say you do a click. We return instantly.
2011-06-08T08:04:43  <simonstewart> you then perform a "findElement". I think that all the drivers will check for a page load before executing that
2011-06-08T08:04:49  <simonstewart> but we're fast
2011-06-08T08:04:59  <simonstewart> so quite often the page load _hasn't started_
2011-06-08T08:05:09  <simonstewart> We're a "mostly blocking" API
2011-06-08T08:06:56  <barancev> non-reliable blocking :)
2011-06-08T08:07:04  <simonstewart> sadly, right :)
2011-06-08T08:07:48  <jimevans> comes with the territory of asynchronous user interactions (read: native events)
2011-06-08T08:08:00  <barancev> then why you told about adding waits to test as "too enthusiastic"? :)
2011-06-08T08:08:13  <simonstewart> Because "get" _should_ be blocking
2011-06-08T08:08:21  <simonstewart> and there's a test to confirm that
2011-06-08T08:08:27  <simonstewart> which had a "wait" thrown into it

2011-06-08T08:44:07  <AutomatedTester> interesting...
2011-06-08T08:45:02  <simonstewart> I wonder....
2011-06-08T08:45:15  <AutomatedTester> ok so its not reporting for me
2011-06-08T08:45:39  <simonstewart> You need to have imported the utils first
2011-06-08T08:48:35  <jimevans> so, 2.0rc3? i'm inclined to say yes.
2011-06-08T08:48:39  <simonstewart> OK. So that bad certificate server is the thing standing in our way
2011-06-08T08:48:49  <simonstewart> I'd love to get (at least basic) firefox 5 support in

2011-06-08T08:50:50  <simonstewart> As long as it works with other versions of Firefox, sure
2011-06-08T08:51:07  <AutomatedTester> simonstewart: according to the docs I will be adding more support with this approach

2011-06-08T09:17:52  <aivaturi> Hi guys
2011-06-08T09:19:15  <simonstewart> hi
2011-06-08T09:20:04  <aivaturi> So got back to Perl driver development after a while & I noticed something weird with rc2
2011-06-08T09:20:34  <aivaturi> on Mac I get a 500 error for a new session request but on windows it works as expected
2011-06-08T09:20:53  <aivaturi> is it just me?
2011-06-08T09:22:13  <freynaud>  aivaturi do you have the same settings on both machine ?
2011-06-08T09:22:13  <simonstewart> which driver are you trying to create?
2011-06-08T09:22:58  <aivaturi> Remote & all I did was dowload standalone jar & just run it
2011-06-08T09:23:12  <aivaturi> pretty much defaults for both machines
2011-06-08T09:23:34  <simonstewart> Is there anything on the console of the server?
2011-06-08T09:23:44  <simonstewart> A 500 is an internal error, and we'd expect to see _something_
2011-06-08T09:24:01  <freynaud> i remember having something like that for grid, because i had the wrong settings for follow redirect
2011-06-08T09:24:14  <freynaud> the new session requt is a 2 step one
2011-06-08T09:24:48  <aivaturi> There is no error on the console of server - which is the weird part but I see it on the Perl output
2011-06-08T09:25:06  <aivaturi> freynaud: I'm using it on windows & Ubuntu - they worked fine
2011-06-08T09:25:15  <aivaturi> I guess something is messed up on my Mac

2011-06-08T10:43:38  <L4nce0> so my boss really wants me to try to find a way to get Selenium to download a file. (I'm telling him I could more quickly just parse the page, and turn it into an excel sheet.. and that I already have that done..), ahem, but when you click download selenium seems to fail as it's well, now a windows issue.. can I download without a popup? or any clever ideas?
2011-06-08T10:46:22  <autojack> I'm using Ruby and selenium-webdriver too. I have an element that has an onClick event associated with it, so I think I need to click it with a mouse event to fire it. but when I try to do mouse.click, I get: undefined method `mouseMoveTo' for #<Selenium::WebDriver::Driver:0x10192f2a0 browser=:firefox>
2011-06-08T10:46:35  <autojack> I get the impression mouse events like this aren't supported yet?
2011-06-08T10:47:12  <autojack> L4nce0: is the goal to use Selenium to verify that the file was downloaded? e.g. that it wasn't a 404?
2011-06-08T10:47:23  <autojack> L4nce0: or is the goal just to use Selenium to automatically download files?
2011-06-08T10:47:35  <autojack> i.e. are you actually trying to TEST something or just automate something?
2011-06-08T10:47:47  <L4nce0> autojack, well I click download and windows says where to download! .. and the program can't continue
2011-06-08T10:47:51  <L4nce0> automate ;)
2011-06-08T10:48:04  <autojack> I get that part.
2011-06-08T10:48:11  <autojack> I'm asking what your boss is trying to accomplish.
2011-06-08T10:48:15  <autojack> by using Selenium.
2011-06-08T10:48:33  <autojack> there's no way to get Selenium to interact with that download window.
2011-06-08T10:48:41  <L4nce0> I choose selenium, as HTMLunit failed to navigate javascript
2011-06-08T10:48:43  <autojack> I can suggest a couple of solutions depending on what you're trying to do.
2011-06-08T10:48:53  <L4nce0> oh yeah?
2011-06-08T10:48:58  <autojack> yeah.
2011-06-08T10:49:09  <autojack> OK so you just want to download files.
2011-06-08T10:49:34  <L4nce0> I have a website, it provides excel sheets I need for a database. I need to download them. I need to go through a page and enter 3 links, and hit download on each
2011-06-08T10:49:41  <autojack> OK.
2011-06-08T10:49:53  <autojack> what browser are you using? Firefox?
2011-06-08T10:49:56  <L4nce0> yes
2011-06-08T10:50:16  <autojack> I'm pretty sure there is a Firefox preference that will let you tell it to always automatically download files to a default location.
2011-06-08T10:50:26  <autojack> then it won't show you the popup "save file" dialog.
2011-06-08T10:50:30  <autojack> that might be one solution.
2011-06-08T10:50:49  <L4nce0> hmm true, though selenium uses a blank profile.. but thats fixable
2011-06-08T10:51:01  <L4nce0> all I would have to do is rename it.
2011-06-08T10:51:11  <autojack> nod.
2011-06-08T10:51:16  <autojack> so
2011-06-08T10:51:32  <autojack> I'm on a Mac. my FF preferences, on the General pane, has the settings you would want.
2011-06-08T10:51:41  <autojack> set "Save files to:" to a location you want.
2011-06-08T10:51:51  <autojack> instead of using "Always ask me where to save files"
2011-06-08T10:52:05  <L4nce0> that a really good idea autojack  =)
2011-06-08T10:52:07  <autojack> and then yeah, get that setting to stick in the profile Selenium uyses.
2011-06-08T10:52:17  <autojack> thanks. I'm full of them ;)
2011-06-08T10:52:28  <L4nce0> all this extra work because my boss is stuborn, got to love software
2011-06-08T10:52:35  <autojack> yeah I hear you.
2011-06-08T10:52:41  <autojack> that's the quick solution.
2011-06-08T10:53:06  <autojack> another thing you could do is use Selenium to navigate the page, fill in the form and so on, and then grab the URL to the file all in your program.
2011-06-08T10:53:21  <autojack> then pass that URL to some sort of HTTP library in your program and use that to download, save the file, name it, whatever.

2011-06-08T10:53:40  <autojack> I don't know what language you're using with Selenium...
2011-06-08T10:53:52  <L4nce0> the site uses some nasty cookie system, which I've been batteling for a day now.
2011-06-08T10:53:54  <autojack> but that should be do-able.
2011-06-08T10:53:54  <L4nce0> java
2011-06-08T10:54:01  <autojack> ok. I don't really know Java at all.
2011-06-08T10:54:11  <autojack> but you can see what I'm getting at.
2011-06-08T10:54:12  <L4nce0> which ones do you know?
2011-06-08T10:54:14  <L4nce0> yep
2011-06-08T10:54:26  <autojack> Ruby is my current language of choice. I also know Perl.
2011-06-08T10:54:42  <autojack> I "know" Java but I have never used it with Selenium.
2011-06-08T10:55:00  <autojack> but yeah if you wanted to have some more control over the process you could do it that way.
2011-06-08T10:55:11  <L4nce0> I want to learn perl, it seems fun

2011-06-08T11:02:17  *** esteele has left #selenium
2011-06-08T11:02:40  <autojack> however, I'm not really experienced enough to make blanket statements about stuff like that so I avoid really advocating for one language over another :)
2011-06-08T11:03:11  <autojack> Perl is just super useful when you need to do some fast text processing/regexing etc.
2011-06-08T11:03:22  <autojack> compared to the Java regex engine which I consider really clunky.
2011-06-08T11:04:20  <L4nce0> don't talk about regex system /shudder some of the crap it pulls

2011-06-08T11:05:03  <L4nce0> string.relpaceAll("  "," "); would fail

2011-06-08T11:16:52  <kenkoontz> While looking at the python bindings for selenium, I noticed that the click_and_wait methods don't exist. Are the bindings being updated?
2011-06-08T11:17:15  <simonstewart> click and wait isn't implemented on the web_element
2011-06-08T11:17:22  <simonstewart> or webdriver interfaces
2011-06-08T11:18:03  <kenkoontz> Sorry I meant selenium 1.
2011-06-08T11:18:17  <simonstewart> The bindings won't be updated
2011-06-08T11:18:27  <simonstewart> We're pretty close to 2.0 final
2011-06-08T11:18:47  <AutomatedTester> kenkoontz: i dont believe any of the other bindings have that command
2011-06-08T11:20:13  <autojack> I remember having this problem sometimes in Selenium 1/RC. now I'm seeing it sometimes with 2/webdriver: my script starts a Firefox session, the browser loads but shows a blank page, and the script hangs forever, presumably waiting for something from Firefox. anyone else seen this?
2011-06-08T11:20:27  <kenkoontz> @simonstewart Sweet!
2011-06-08T11:20:47  <jarib> autojack: element.click in ruby should trigger js click handlers just fine
2011-06-08T11:20:58  <autojack> "in `connect_until_stable': unable to obtain stable firefox connection in 60 seconds"
2011-06-08T11:21:03  <simonstewart> autojack: take a look in the error console (Tools -> Error Console)
2011-06-08T11:21:15  <autojack> jarib: yeah, I looked at the code again and it actually isn't an onClick event.
2011-06-08T11:21:25  <jarib> so problem solved?
2011-06-08T11:21:37  <autojack> not exactly but I'm working on another approach.
2011-06-08T11:21:56  <autojack> the goal was to click one of those 'select all' checkboxes which has the effect of checking all the other boxes in a list.
2011-06-08T11:22:09  <autojack> when I just used element.click, only the 'select all' box would check.
2011-06-08T11:22:21  <autojack> I assumed it was because it was an onClick box that fired the others.
2011-06-08T11:22:29  <jarib> that should work
2011-06-08T11:22:45  <autojack> yeah now I'm looking at maybe needing to wait for the page to fully render/AJAX/whatever
2011-06-08T11:23:01  <autojack> because even directly clicking the other boxes seems to fail with an 'element not found' error.
2011-06-08T11:23:08  <autojack> even though the element has an ID which I'm using.

2011-06-08T11:25:18  <autojack> how do I check installed extensions?
2011-06-08T11:25:39  <autojack> the error console mentions webdriver.

2011-06-08T11:27:52  <autojack> is there any way I can copy all these at once? it looks like I have to copy each event one at a time.

2011-06-08T11:28:12  <autojack> only the warnings.

2011-06-08T11:34:46  <autojack> and also right now I'm seeing this while testing my tests
2011-06-08T11:35:00  <autojack> so the system is idle and I fire one test, it starts the browser and gets in this state
2011-06-08T11:35:07  <autojack> weird. I assumed everyone had this problem sometimes :)
2011-06-08T11:35:21  <autojack> guessing it's a FF problem
2011-06-08T11:35:53  <autojack> and once again when I kill it from the Ruby side I get:

2011-06-08T11:56:50  <simonstewart> inevitably
2011-06-08T11:57:03  <simonstewart> is this the sort of crash that nukes the server?
2011-06-08T11:57:18  <jimevans> in remote? occasionally.

2011-06-08T13:28:19  <jarib> if you're looking for a higher level api, you could look at watir-webdriver

2011-06-08T13:29:39  <autojack> it's funny, 2 years ago I picked Selenium RC over Watir because I didn't know Ruby and was trying to set something up for non-coders to write tests.
2011-06-08T13:29:51  <autojack> now I'm kind of in the opposite position.
2011-06-08T13:31:51  <jarib> hehe
2011-06-08T13:32:42  <jarib> watir-webdriver wraps the selenium-webdriver gem in the watir api - so it's all the same tech under the hood

2011-06-08T14:57:26  <autojack> heh re HUGE PAIN since it's java :)
2011-06-08T14:57:30  <__mike> okay this is weird. the grid stopped working now too. the same thing happens
2011-06-08T14:57:46  <autojack> cosmic rays.
2011-06-08T14:58:00  <__mike> did one of the latest commits break remotewebdriver ?
2011-06-08T15:01:28  <jarib> works fine for me with java as well
2011-06-08T15:01:33  <jarib> i'm on linux though.
2011-06-08T15:02:05  <jarib> do you have any anti-virus/firewalls installed that may interfere with the network comm.?
2011-06-08T15:02:07  <__mike> just updated to current trunk and gonna rebuild
2011-06-08T15:02:20  <__mike> nope. i've definitely used grid before and it worked fine
2011-06-08T15:02:29  <__mike> if i use grid, i can see the node getting the request
2011-06-08T15:02:54  <__mike> it also gets the get() request but the browser is just shutting

2011-06-08T15:08:13  <__mike> what version chrome are you using ?
2011-06-08T15:08:29  <jarib> chromedriver disables crash reporting etc, so it may just quitely shut down

2011-06-08T15:35:57  <__mike> that was a pretty schoolboy error..
2011-06-08T15:35:58  <JakeSays> so i'm trying to understand webdriver. if i'm using the .net webdriver, do i still need anything java?
2011-06-08T15:36:15  <__mike> JakeSays: afaik, no

2011-06-08T15:37:53  <polm> OK, I've managed to write a short script that causes the crash - looks like it's happening in chromedriver
2011-06-08T15:38:00  <freynaud> but i'd still go for a vnc kind of solution for the layout checks

2011-06-08T15:39:10  <__mike> freynaud : i don't think i could use that solution. it has to be as lightweight as possible. it's more of a library sort of thing :/

2011-06-08T15:39:27  <__mike> btw i wondered.. someone told me earlier you're in london. where do you work ?
2011-06-08T15:39:28  <JakeSays> freynaud: where would vnc fit in?
2011-06-08T15:39:41  <polm> Some of the variable names and at least one print statement don't make sense because I changed it
2011-06-08T15:39:48  <freynaud> JakeSays: on the side really, as a reporting mechanism for the tests
2011-06-08T15:39:52  <polm> But attempting to select by class reliably causes a crash for me

2011-06-08T15:40:17  <JakeSays> freynaud: ah ok. does vnc record?

2011-06-08T15:41:16  <freynaud> __mike: yes, Richmond.
2011-06-08T15:41:23  <JakeSays> but vnc might be a lighter solution
2011-06-08T15:41:29  <__mike> oh cool

2011-06-08T15:42:15  <JakeSays> freynaud: yeah but we already run some of our tests inside vms.
2011-06-08T15:42:24  <polm> Has anyone been comfortably testing using chromedriver lately?
2011-06-08T15:42:29  <polm> On Linux, that is.
2011-06-08T15:42:37  <freynaud> i run all my tests in VM
2011-06-08T15:42:57  <__mike> btw there's another small flaw with using the vnc method. if i were to integrate it into the current jar i could only patch the chromedriver. if i wanted to use the original one as well (which i do) i'd still need to add a new custom webdriver so no way around that i guess
2011-06-08T15:42:59  <freynaud> but i keep the VM stuff minimal = revert snapshot , save etc

2011-06-08T16:56:22  <JakeSays> ok so if i understand things correctly, i fire up chromedriver.exe, then i can run tests written in c# against it?
2011-06-08T16:56:34  <jarib> you don't need to fire it up
2011-06-08T16:56:45  <jarib> just make sure it's on your PATH
2011-06-08T16:56:49  <JakeSays> ah ok
2011-06-08T16:57:03  <JakeSays> so WebDriver launches it?
2011-06-08T16:57:11  <jarib> then instantiate a ChromeDriver (or whatever the equiv. is in .NET) and it will handle the rest
2011-06-08T16:57:14  <jarib> yep
2011-06-08T16:57:24  <JakeSays> ok cool
2011-06-08T16:57:29  <jarib> you *can* of course launch it manually if you want to
2011-06-08T16:57:37  <jarib> and then connect to it using a RemoteWebDriver
2011-06-08T16:57:45  <jarib> (since it implements the same protocol)
2011-06-08T16:58:03  <jarib> this is all explained on the link i gave
2011-06-08T16:58:15  <__mike> and that's the difference between 'client' when language bindings launch it. and 'server' when it's launched seperately
2011-06-08T16:59:06  <JakeSays> that link talks about python - so python is using the remote driver in that case?

2011-06-08T17:41:29  <L4nce0> hey guys, so I made a custom firefox profile.. can I load it from my java code, or must I edit something the the sel server?
2011-06-08T17:44:35  *** stepheneb has quit IRC
2011-06-08T17:52:44  <L4nce0> oka, I got the profile all set up.. but sel deletes the cookieson exit!

2011-06-08T18:00:51  *** miker2 has joined #selenium
2011-06-08T18:04:28  <L4nce0> got it all to work! so ignore all that.
2011-06-08T18:05:03  <L4nce0> so in the old one I could do seleniem.click("link=Server").. but in the new one that doesn't work the same?
2011-06-08T18:05:51  <L4nce0> So I'll need to use findelementbylinktext?
2011-06-08T18:07:27  <L4nce0> that fails... I would really prefer to keep it working with link text, makes my gode sooo much more clear

2011-06-08T18:52:19  <Binken> Hi, Anyone?
2011-06-08T18:52:29  <rpk> hello?
2011-06-08T18:52:49  <L4nce0> this isn't eclipse channle...
2011-06-08T18:53:09  <rpk> L4nce0, trying to reproduce a bug...
2011-06-08T18:53:30  <L4nce0> I think you need to give us more detail ;)
2011-06-08T18:54:38  <rpk> L4nce0, last weekend I was helping someone write a script, and one of the exceptions thrown indicated the OS was VISTA, as opposed to Windows 7, which the os.name string returns correctly.  However, I fixed their script and cleaned it up for them when they got close enough to the correct solution.
2011-06-08T18:55:07  <rpk> The pastebins apparently have expired, and win 7 didn't have previous versions for the file, so I have no way to reproduce :/
2011-06-08T18:55:29  <L4nce0> pastebin? I got screwed once as google cashed my pastebins ;)
2011-06-08T18:55:38  <rpk> hmm, worth a try
2011-06-08T18:55:42  <L4nce0> got accused of cheating in my class
2011-06-08T18:56:35  <L4nce0> but n eclipse you have to configure that I believe, but I'm not an expert in it
2011-06-08T18:58:11  <rpk> oh sweet, I think google cached his pastebins
2011-06-08T18:58:17  <rpk> now to try and reproduce ...
2011-06-08T18:58:25  <L4nce0> =)
2011-06-08T19:01:10  <rpk> Oh, crap.  Hmm, apparently the one I need is from fpaste, which google doesn't cache.  :/  oh well
2011-06-08T19:02:10  <rpk> Binken: you wanted something?

2011-06-08T19:16:41  <rpk> yes?
2011-06-08T19:16:52  <Binken> rpk, I have issue on Advanced interaction API
2011-06-08T19:17:04  <Binken> I am finding a workaround
2011-06-08T19:17:05  <rpk> oh, sorry, can't help you there :/
2011-06-08T19:17:15  <Binken> http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=1791
2011-06-08T19:17:43  <Binken> Aha, So can help me others :)
2011-06-08T19:18:09  <Binken> rpk, Have you designed any framework base on selenium 2?
2011-06-08T19:18:22  <rpk> my company is in the process
2011-06-08T19:18:36  <rpk> right now its a lot of boring stuff with page components
2011-06-08T19:18:58  <Binken> Me too :)
2011-06-08T19:19:49  <rpk> we did build this really nice tool to provide a web interface to launch tests from, deploy new builds, and then push the test results into BI though.
2011-06-08T19:20:18  <rpk> which IMO is one of the biggest things Grid is missing
2011-06-08T19:20:32  <Binken> IMO? what's that
2011-06-08T19:20:42  <rpk> in my opinion?
2011-06-08T19:21:18  <Binken> you mean the Grid 2?
2011-06-08T19:21:20  <rpk> Grid is great, but theres no ability to manage parallel execution of tests, gathering results, pushing new builds to workers
2011-06-08T19:21:20  <rpk> yeah
2011-06-08T19:21:44  <Binken> for now, We are running the tests one by one.
2011-06-08T19:22:00  <Binken> I am still finding the best way do it parallelly
2011-06-08T19:22:06  <rpk> ah, lucky.  our test base will be too big to not use grid
2011-06-08T19:29:26  <Binken> You are using the pageobject pattern?
2011-06-08T19:29:35  <rpk> loadable component
2011-06-08T19:29:37  <rpk> but yeah
2011-06-08T19:30:16  <Binken> You are using the Java bings?
2011-06-08T19:30:59  <rpk> yep
2011-06-08T19:31:03  <rpk> We're kind of a java shop
2011-06-08T19:31:32  <Binken> :-)
2011-06-08T19:32:07  <Binken> I am using our own pageobject framwork
2011-06-08T19:32:20  <Binken> .net
2011-06-08T19:32:42  <Binken> .net bings do not have the loadable componet yet
2011-06-08T19:33:08  <rpk> Ah ok.  Why not just write it yourself from the java code?
2011-06-08T19:33:19  <rpk> You can pretty much just copy and paste the java ...
2011-06-08T19:34:08  <Binken> I'll try it :)
2011-06-08T19:37:46  <rpk> work?
2011-06-08T19:38:07  <Binken> not yet :)
2011-06-08T19:40:48  <Binken> you are using the remotedriver one or firefoxDriver one?
2011-06-08T19:41:01  <rpk> Remote, running against a grid
2011-06-08T19:41:22  <Binken> I met a issue to run the grid on my localmachine
2011-06-08T19:41:46  <Binken> first step , I use java command to run the grid
2011-06-08T19:41:49  <Binken> it's ok
2011-06-08T19:42:00  <Binken> Java ¨Cjar selenium-server-2.0rc1.jar ¨Crole rc  -hub http://localhost:4444/grid/register -port 5555
2011-06-08T19:42:11  <Binken> when I register, I get error message
2011-06-08T19:48:21  <rpk> and the error message is ...

2011-06-08T23:24:01  <yg> hi
2011-06-08T23:24:41  <yg> i'm trying to build a testscript in java, do i need webdriver and RC?
2011-06-08T23:25:12  <yg> if not how can i tell the testscript where RC is located/running
2011-06-08T23:25:54  <Binken[A]> you could go to the wiki site
2011-06-08T23:25:54  *** Binken[A] is now known as Binken
2011-06-08T23:25:54  * Binken is no longer away : Gone for 3 hours 15 minutes 21 seconds
2011-06-08T23:26:31  <yg> yes i found it but the examples does not include an ip-adress for RC like perlscript
2011-06-08T23:27:48  <Binken> have you start the webdriver server using the java -jar command
2011-06-08T23:28:07  *** eghm has joined #selenium
2011-06-08T23:28:12  <yg> not the webdriver, sel rc2

2011-06-08T23:28:37  *** reddeviL is now known as red^
2011-06-08T23:31:07  <Binken> you can use the remotedriver instead of firefoxdriver etc..
2011-06-08T23:31:33  <Binken> the class called remotewebdriver
2011-06-08T23:33:06  <yg> the example shows driver=Selenium::WebDriver... for ruby can you point me to an example for java?
2011-06-08T23:33:53  <yg> what I'mm looking for: how to tell the client where the server is located
2011-06-08T23:34:27  <Binken> I think something similar like this   driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub"),DesiredCapabilities.InternetExplorer())
2011-06-08T23:34:46  <yg> ok, i'll try it, thanks
