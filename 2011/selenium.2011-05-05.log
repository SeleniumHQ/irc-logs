2011-05-05T04:07:11  <admc1> done
2011-05-05T04:07:59  <shudder> Thanks. My question: When I start the test-case on the vServer via CLI, the Firefox
2011-05-05T04:08:01  <shudder> instance(s) are opening up on my local machine due to X-Forwarding.
2011-05-05T04:08:26  <shudder> When I shutdown my local machine, the test-case also stops.
2011-05-05T04:08:27  <shudder> Is there a way to let the test run fully automatized without the
2011-05-05T04:08:29  <shudder> dependence of another platform where the Firefox instance has to be
2011-05-05T04:08:29  *** zmijunkie has joined #selenium
2011-05-05T04:08:30  <shudder> opened up all the time?
2011-05-05T04:09:18  <shudder> btw, I am using Selenium RC 2.0b3 together with PHPUnit
2011-05-05T04:12:17  <AutomatedTester> shudder: I dont understand, if the calls are being forwarded to your machine, shouldnt you stop that and that would solve the issue?
2011-05-05T04:13:20  <shudder> When I don't use x-forwarding it gives me an error messages that selenium wasn't able to initialize a browser session
2011-05-05T04:14:15  *** stepheneb has joined #selenium
2011-05-05T04:14:44  <shudder> So I would really love to stop forwarding, but i don't know how. Anyway, I don't want to disable x-forwarding in total because it's useful from time to time to check if the test-case is still running properly

2011-05-05T07:13:30  <DarkRift> probably the same answer as me ... using js to scroll the page
2011-05-05T07:13:58  <schweizer> AutomatedTester: yes, but i the page is in a html popup
2011-05-05T07:14:16  <AutomatedTester> schweizer: and?

2011-05-05T07:50:34  <DarkRift> -s
2011-05-05T07:52:47  <DarkRift> or anyone else ... is there any way to have the grid dispatch a class to the right machines before executing it ? like if I wanted to test a class on multiple different configurations of browser/os so it sends the WebDriver class to the registered node so they execute on that machine instead ? Isn't it what it's supposed to do with WebDriver ?

2011-05-05T11:27:43  <jleyba> no
2011-05-05T11:28:01  <jleyba> but you can grab it's src attribute, then fetch the data yourself using a HTTP client library

2011-05-05T11:29:42  <jleyba> melter: isn't the metadata stored in the png header?  you shouldn't have to download the whole file a second time

2011-05-05T11:53:07  <jleyba> jimevans: Looks fine to me.   I'd change the resource URLs a bit, but you documented what's already in place for Firefox and the DriverServlet
2011-05-05T11:53:19  <jimevans> and IE.
2011-05-05T11:53:48  <jimevans> i was documenting the current implementation, pretty much. we can always change it round.
2011-05-05T11:53:53  <jleyba> We need to document on that wiki somewhere what happens with unhandled alerts
2011-05-05T11:54:47  <jimevans> i don't disagree, but i'm not volunteering to do it either. :)
2011-05-05T11:55:28  <jleyba> I do have a request while you're here :)

2011-05-05T11:56:17  <jleyba> FindElementCommandHandler.h is using a busy-loop for implicit waits
2011-05-05T11:56:35  <jimevans> so it is.
2011-05-05T11:56:39  <jleyba> Would you mind inserting a sleep between iterations so the thread yields?
2011-05-05T11:57:04  <jimevans> no worries. that's easy. :)

2011-05-05T12:02:10  <jleyba> 100 should be good

2011-05-05T12:04:12  <jimevans> i'll start it at 250, and make it a constant in session.h. we can adjust as required.

2011-05-05T13:08:01  <jimevans> well then you should check the commit logs. that's just about the only change I can think of that would have a performance implication in the code that's not specific to a single language binding.
2011-05-05T13:08:57  <barancev> it is not IE itself -- java eats ~50% CPU when runs tests in IE
2011-05-05T13:09:57  <barancev> when I run go test_firefox, java eats ~10% CPU and FF eats ~40%
2011-05-05T13:10:04  <jimevans> ok, i don't run the java bindings very often.

2011-05-05T13:59:00  <barancev> it must be something on my PC that causes IE to work slow

2011-05-05T14:00:01  <barancev> IE itself works as usually, fast enough, when run manually
2011-05-05T14:02:28  <jimevans> i don't know. installing an add-in or toolbar might do it, if the add-in is listening inefficiently to events.
2011-05-05T14:02:45  <jimevans> we're doing pretty straightforward COM stuff under the covers.
