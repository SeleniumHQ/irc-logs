2011-06-17T02:23:20  <WavingDavid> ok, we developed an api for our customers, and want to autmatically test it. Api call http://blah/planNumberMap returns an xml document: view-source gives:

2011-06-17T02:24:54  <WavingDavid> Selenium gets this far great. I now want to storeValue <Number> and <numberRange>, and use them to build the URL of the next call, http://blah/mapNumber/0706?number=3124752
2011-06-17T02:25:24  *** zmijunkie has joined #selenium
2011-06-17T02:26:20  <WavingDavid> storeValue xpath=/root/data/Number seems not to work.
2011-06-17T02:26:24  <WavingDavid> any advice?
2011-06-17T02:26:33  <freynaud> WavingDavid: why are you using selenium for a webdriver for a web service ?
2011-06-17T02:26:53  <freynaud> WavingDavid: it adds the overhead of controlling a browser, when it's not needed
2011-06-17T02:27:05  <WavingDavid> um, becuase I'm a noob, I just discovered it and it looks useful ?
2011-06-17T02:27:23  <freynaud> webdriver will help you testing web pages, JS etc
2011-06-17T02:27:31  <freynaud> but for a web service, it's overkill
2011-06-17T02:27:50  <WavingDavid> yeah, but it's visual and lets me see if I'm heading in right direction !
2011-06-17T02:28:23  <freynaud> :)

2011-06-17T02:33:04  *** nirvdrum has quit IRC
2011-06-17T02:33:50  <freynaud> as I said, selenium is great to test web pages
2011-06-17T02:34:07  <freynaud> you have an xml document, this is not really a web page
2011-06-17T02:34:49  <freynaud> it will be faster and easier to send the request manually and parse the xml with an xml parser
2011-06-17T02:35:50  <WavingDavid> any suggestion of good tools to automate testing an api then ? Api returns either xml or JSON, so either will do . Personally prefer json as easier to read, but YMMV.

2011-06-17T03:37:06  <__mike> hi simonstewart do you know what's wrong with this code ? i'm trying to scroll a list in sencha touch http://pastebin.com/8TvvB2Zu
2011-06-17T03:37:43  <simonstewart> I'm not sure
2011-06-17T03:37:48  <simonstewart> method 1 should work
2011-06-17T03:38:04  <simonstewart> (provided, he says, that the chrome driver has the user interactions api)
2011-06-17T03:38:10  <simonstewart> what happens when you run it?
2011-06-17T03:38:16  <__mike> it moves the list a tiny bit
2011-06-17T03:38:23  <__mike> all 3 methods moves the list a tiny bit
2011-06-17T03:38:29  <__mike> but definitely not scrolling is as you'd expect
2011-06-17T03:38:40  <simonstewart> And how far do you expect it to move
2011-06-17T03:38:43  <simonstewart> ?
2011-06-17T03:39:04  <__mike> well it's scrolling the bottom one up to where the top one is so i'd expect it to move the list 1 page down
2011-06-17T03:39:24  <simonstewart> Sounds reasonable
2011-06-17T03:39:28  <simonstewart> eranm: yt?

2011-06-17T03:41:09  <__mike> how does the draganddrop work ? does it take the coordinates of when it's called and work off that or does it keep updating the coordinates ?

2011-06-17T03:41:23  <__mike> if it updates then maybe that's why it's screwing up since the top one goes off the screen

2011-06-17T03:41:42  <eranm> Hi
2011-06-17T03:41:52  <Lumbendil> hi eranm
2011-06-17T03:41:58  <__mike> do you know why my code for scrolling a list in sencha touch isn't working ? ; )
2011-06-17T03:42:30  <__mike> http://pastebin.com/8TvvB2Zu i tried 3 different methods. you should just be able to stick that in eclipse and hit ctrl-alt-o and test it if you have time : )
2011-06-17T03:42:48  <__mike> but basically i am expecting the list to be scrolled down one page but it scrolls it like 5 pixels
2011-06-17T03:44:48  <eranm> __mike, I see you're using Chrome
2011-06-17T03:45:48  <__mike> yep. i think sencha touch is only supposed to be used with chrome for time being because it has superior support for html5
2011-06-17T03:45:57  <eranm> I'm not familiar enough with the implementation of the interactions API in the Chrome driver to know why it doesn't work.
2011-06-17T03:46:34  <__mike> hm let me try with ff and ie and see if it does anything different
2011-06-17T03:46:49  <eranm> At the moment I'm solving issues with mouse movements requiring scrolling on Firefox. I will look at chrome afterwards.
2011-06-17T03:46:57  <__mike> cheers eranm
2011-06-17T03:47:00  <eranm> But this example should work with the FirefoxDriver, as no scrolling of the page takes place
2011-06-17T03:47:37  <simonstewart> thanks eranm
2011-06-17T03:48:01  *** ivog has joined #selenium
2011-06-17T03:48:44  <__mike> yeah eranm the page does not load up properly in ff3 which is what i'm using. i think it's because of the lack of support for html5
2011-06-17T03:49:52  <__mike> so do you know who i'd talk to about getting it to work in chrome ?
2011-06-17T03:50:06  <eranm> __mike, how about Firefox 4?
2011-06-17T03:50:31  *** nirvdrum has joined #selenium
2011-06-17T03:50:46  <__mike> let me try firefox 4 now
2011-06-17T03:51:01  <eranm> You'll have to build Selenium yourself from trunk, though, as I've committed a fix to mouse clicking on Firefox that is required for your example to work
2011-06-17T03:51:04  *** dave_miles has joined #selenium
2011-06-17T03:51:19  <eranm> Actually, I see you don't use the click action directly, so it should be OK with RC2

2011-06-17T03:53:03  <Stuk> simonstewart: sure, I can start doing that

2011-06-17T03:53:18  <__mike> okay i'll build from trunk
2011-06-17T03:53:18  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-06-17T03:53:27  <simonstewart> Thank you
2011-06-17T03:56:51  <jarib> __mike: wouldn't you want to drag in the other direction to scroll?
2011-06-17T03:57:46  <__mike> surely you want to drag the bottom one to the position of the top one
2011-06-17T03:57:55  <__mike> if you drag top to bottom then it's gonna try to scroll up
2011-06-17T03:58:03  <jarib> ah, misread
2011-06-17T03:58:34  <jarib> though in the moveByOffset case it looks like you're dragging to the right, not up
2011-06-17T03:59:59  <__mike> why is that ? the first param is x and second is y. so if i want to scroll it up then 0, 100 is okay, right ?
2011-06-17T04:01:24  <jarib> IIRC you want (-100, 0)
2011-06-17T04:01:34  <jarib> i may be wrong
2011-06-17T04:01:52  <__mike> let me try that : )

2011-06-17T04:04:14  <__mike> jarib : it does the same thing. ie. scrolls it down by about 5 pixels

2011-06-17T06:01:44  <jarib> __mike: i did it in ruby, but should be the same: https://gist.github.com/1031384
2011-06-17T06:02:10  <jarib> __mike: oh.. this machine may actually have a newer chromedriver build
2011-06-17T06:02:52  <jarib> let me try the released build with the same script real quick
2011-06-17T06:02:57  <__mike> do you know how i can get hold of one of those.. ? i don't want to download chromium source again. i nearly died last time i did that
2011-06-17T06:03:01  <__mike> thanks : )
2011-06-17T06:05:46  <jarib> right, no scrolling with the old build
2011-06-17T06:06:03  <jarib> if you're on x86_64 linux i can give you the build i have, otherwise you'll have to build from source yourself
2011-06-17T06:06:11  <jarib> or wait for a new release
2011-06-17T06:07:13  <__mike> i don't think i'm going to try building again.. too painful opening up the project. takes forever
2011-06-17T06:07:20  <__mike> do you know when a release might be out ? same time as rc3 ?
2011-06-17T06:07:24  <__mike> or is it completely separate ?
2011-06-17T06:07:35  <jarib> i have no idea
2011-06-17T06:07:52  <jarib> last one was in sync with rc2, not sure if that's the plan forward
2011-06-17T06:08:07  <jarib> perhaps jleyba could tell us ^
2011-06-17T06:08:08  <simonstewart> the release of the chromedriver is independent of the selenium releases
2011-06-17T06:08:11  <simonstewart> But we chat
2011-06-17T06:08:28  <__mike> do any of you guys have a current chromedriver.exe ? : D

2011-06-17T06:12:36  <jarib> it seems small compared to the released version though

2011-06-17T06:37:55  <__mike> hey jarib. using the new chromedriver.exe it keeps polling with the heartbeat (healthz) but chrome never launches so it times out eventually. i'm using the trunk of selenium
2011-06-17T06:38:20  <simonstewart> They may have changed the health URL
2011-06-17T06:39:51  <__mike> is there a patch i can quickly make to trunk for that ?
2011-06-17T06:40:17  <simonstewart> If you pull in the latest selenium source for the chromedriver you should be okay
2011-06-17T06:40:41  <__mike> cool. just updated. i'll build and get back to you
2011-06-17T06:40:48  <simonstewart> tahsnk
2011-06-17T06:40:52  <simonstewart> thanks
2011-06-17T06:41:04  <jarib> trunk still checks /healthz
2011-06-17T06:41:18  <jarib> they've changed it to /status (http://codesearch.google.com/codesearch#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/chrome/test/webdriver/server.cc&type=cs&l=67)
2011-06-17T06:41:47  <__mike> do you know which source i should patch for that ? or are you guys gonna patch that and update the trunk ?
2011-06-17T06:42:04  <jarib> __mike: ChromeDriverService.java
2011-06-17T06:42:21  <simonstewart> I'll do it now
2011-06-17T06:43:10  <jarib> simonstewart: i assume you'll make a change that also works with the latest release
2011-06-17T06:43:43  <simonstewart> I wish they'd keep that url stable
2011-06-17T06:44:05  <jarib> and, can we get a codesearch like chromium for selenium as well, kthxbye
2011-06-17T06:44:17  *** schweizer has left #selenium

2011-06-17T06:44:37  <__mike> can't you do a codesearch in the browser on the online svn ?
2011-06-17T06:44:48  <jarib> not as nice as this one
2011-06-17T06:45:00  <jarib> this one has magic powers

2011-06-17T07:01:34  <rpk> no
2011-06-17T07:02:07  <simonstewart> Though here's a great place to hang out to find out
2011-06-17T07:02:17  <rpk> Theres a roadmap, but its not up to date.  the release schedule is "kept in simonstewart's head"
2011-06-17T07:02:51  <simonstewart> The next release is RC3
2011-06-17T07:03:00  <rpk> speaking of, I thought someone two days ago mentioned RC3 was due yesterday?
2011-06-17T07:03:05  <simonstewart> Yeah
2011-06-17T07:03:11  <rpk> I was in the channel, but didn't notice any major bugs preventing release?
2011-06-17T07:03:15  <rpk> or people just didn't get to it?
2011-06-17T07:03:16  <jrock20041> simonstewart: You need to start your ssh server in your brain so we can connect to it
2011-06-17T07:03:22  <simonstewart> We delayed it because jarib pointed out that it wasn't possible to replace the deprecated "setSelected" yet
2011-06-17T07:03:31  <simonstewart> I'm on IRC :)
2011-06-17T07:03:38  <rpk> oh, I remember that.  what was the decision?
2011-06-17T07:03:43  <simonstewart> I need to make some time to do it (or, rather, someone does)
2011-06-17T07:03:47  <simonstewart> yeah
2011-06-17T07:03:51  *** Ivog_ has quit IRC
2011-06-17T07:04:01  <simonstewart> We wait until setSelected works on Firefox without native events
2011-06-17T07:04:04  <simonstewart> Then we push
2011-06-17T07:04:09  <simonstewart> I have "Sunday" scheduled to do that
2011-06-17T07:04:12  <rpk> ah ok, cool
2011-06-17T07:04:13  <simonstewart> If no-one beats me to it
2011-06-17T07:04:41  <simonstewart> I want RC3 out ASAP
2011-06-17T07:06:23  <rpk> all the cool kids are building from source though.  =)
2011-06-17T07:06:51  <jrock20041> simonstewart: Yeah that means more refactoring for me :)
2011-06-17T07:07:21  <simonstewart> That's part of the reason it's taking me a while.
2011-06-17T07:07:32  <simonstewart> I'm updating the version of selenium we use at work to "rc3"
2011-06-17T07:07:41  <simonstewart> And there's a terrifying amount of code to delete
2011-06-17T07:08:02  <jrock20041> simonstewart: are there gonna be more depreciations?
2011-06-17T07:08:04  <simonstewart> Or rather, fix up
2011-06-17T07:08:09  <simonstewart> From what's there?
2011-06-17T07:08:10  <rpk> what are you updating from?
2011-06-17T07:08:13  <simonstewart> Now? In source?
2011-06-17T07:08:30  <simonstewart> r12430 right now
2011-06-17T07:08:37  <selbot2> simon.m.stewart 7 days ago - SimonStewart: Not all drivers implement HasCapabilities. Make the WebDriverCommandProcessor robust against this fact - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=12430
2011-06-17T07:08:42  <simonstewart> But I'll be bumping that up before I check in
2011-06-17T07:08:48  <barancev> is it possible to set FirefoxDriver to use custom webdriver.xpi instead of the one included in java-client.jar?
2011-06-17T07:09:16  <simonstewart> It's a Really Bad Idea
2011-06-17T07:09:36  <barancev> I want to add some logging to debug :)
2011-06-17T07:09:50  <__mike> hi jarib i'm using the new chromedriver.exe and i patched the status url but it exhibits the same behaviour when attempting the scroll. any ideas ?
2011-06-17T07:10:03  <barancev> #1868 - I've beat by this bug too and want to fix it

2011-06-17T07:10:50  <simonstewart> Put the debugging into the driver itself
2011-06-17T07:11:20  <barancev> how come? I want to add logging to js code
2011-06-17T07:11:30  <barancev> firefoxDriver.js
2011-06-17T07:12:06  <simonstewart> Sorry: in the extension itself
2011-06-17T07:12:10  <simonstewart> Logger.dumpn is your friend
2011-06-17T07:12:39  <rpk> is there a component level architecture diagram anywhere?
2011-06-17T07:12:58  <simonstewart> The AOSA book chapter has the most detail

2011-06-17T07:13:29  <simonstewart> yes
2011-06-17T07:13:30  <barancev> do you mean: start FirefoxDriver, wait while it unpacks extention and add loggind to it? good, thanks!
2011-06-17T07:13:32  <freynaud> it makes FF4 not testable
2011-06-17T07:14:03  <simonstewart> No: I mean "add your logging in the JS file by calling "Logger.dumpn""
2011-06-17T07:14:12  <barancev> freynaud: a workaround is "click berfore sendKeys"
2011-06-17T07:14:26  <simonstewart> ernam: ^^ is that on your radar?
2011-06-17T07:14:33  <freynaud> barancev: how elegant :)
2011-06-17T07:15:07  <barancev> simonstewart: but where to find this JS on disk??? I thought it is packed inside webdriver.xpi and it is packed inside java-client.jar
2011-06-17T07:15:17  <simonstewart> have you got the source?
2011-06-17T07:15:22  <barancev> yes

2011-06-17T07:15:29  <barancev> you suggent to rebuild?

2011-06-17T07:28:08  <rpk> its all ambient. its really made to be listened to as an album mostly, the songs kind of flow together and have light and dark themes.
2011-06-17T07:28:43  <Stuk> for ambient I really like Solar Fields

2011-06-17T08:35:25  <__mike> i don't think javascript can be used to size chrome ?
2011-06-17T08:35:26  <jarib> sorry, bad connection :)
2011-06-17T08:35:37  <jarib> that's right
2011-06-17T08:35:42  <jleyba> (in java) ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("window.moveTo(0, 0); window.resizeTo(window.screen.availWidth, window.screen.availHeight);")
2011-06-17T08:35:50  <__mike> resizeTo won't work in chrome
2011-06-17T08:35:54  <jleyba> Yup
2011-06-17T08:35:59  <jarib> chrome only supports that for popup windows
2011-06-17T08:36:00  <jleyba> there's been a bug against chromium for that since 2008
2011-06-17T08:36:09  <__mike> yep 2091
2011-06-17T08:36:16  <__mike> any other way ?
2011-06-17T08:36:24  <jarib> __mike: anyway, it's not java - your code worked fine
2011-06-17T08:36:37  <jleyba> __mike: using the new chromedriver?
2011-06-17T08:36:41  <__mike> jarib : you didn't change anything ?
2011-06-17T08:36:55  <__mike> yes i'm using the prebuilt one for 17/06. also updated the url /healthz > /status
2011-06-17T08:37:04  <__mike> otherwise i'm building from trunk
2011-06-17T08:37:11  <jarib> i had to recompile to change the path to the driver
2011-06-17T08:37:31  <jarib> and now i'm running on OS X... (no java set up on my win7 vm)
2011-06-17T08:37:32  <__mike> you mean the webdriver.chrome.driver system property in my code ?
2011-06-17T08:37:39  <jleyba> I haven't tried this myself, but you could try sending chrome into full screen mode

2011-06-17T08:38:23  <jleyba> driver.findElement(By.tagName("body")).sendKeys(Keys.CONTROL, Keys.SHIFT, "f");

2011-06-17T08:39:00  <__mike> jarib: it could be a problem with chromedriver.exe. since on mac it wouldn't be using that one

2011-06-17T09:09:14  <jarib> probably since it's a snapshot build
2011-06-17T09:09:20  <jarib> gah, this is getting hairy
2011-06-17T09:09:34  <jarib> but it does work (had to manually resize the window to make the menu appear)
2011-06-17T09:10:09  <__mike> i'm not sure if i installed chrome correctly. i downloaded chrome and it popped up some box which let me put chrome in applications. dragged that, deleted the .dmg then i can run chrome
2011-06-17T09:10:15  <__mike> did i do something wrong ?
2011-06-17T09:10:40  <__mike> yes jarib, not sure why sometimes i have to size it too. on smaller resolutions it was fine. probably some issue with sencha touch
2011-06-17T09:11:23  <jarib> __mike: that sounds like the right way to install, but looks like the snapshot builds look for chromium

2011-06-17T09:59:13  <__mike> basically some way to size the client area of the browser. you don't need it for firefox but for chrome and ie the javascript either doesn't allow you to size the browser or it allows it but very inaccurately and unreliably

2011-06-17T11:38:26  <rpk> the rest of the SE tools are all packaged together, bromine isn't included in that as well

2011-06-17T11:38:39  <algard> well bromine is not really an Se tool
2011-06-17T11:38:42  <rpk> also bromine doesn't have a compatible license with Selenium

2011-06-17T13:57:49  <jleyba> In the rakefile, there are two definitions for version (line 41 & 576).  the def on 576 appears to be ignored - just curious why that is

2011-06-17T14:00:33  <jarib> looking
2011-06-17T14:02:29  <jarib> jleyba: if there's a local variable and a method with the same name, ruby will use the lvar
2011-06-17T14:03:48  <jarib> unlike python or js doing    foo   as opposed to    foo()   doesn't actually return a method object, it calls the method
2011-06-17T14:03:59  <jarib> (since parentheses are optional)

2011-06-17T15:48:56  <dhackner> is there any need to still use jquery selectors w/webdriver?
2011-06-17T15:49:37  <jarib> dhackner: what do you mean?
2011-06-17T15:49:44  <dhackner> w/SE1
2011-06-17T15:49:54  <dhackner> I had added the jquery library to enable jquery selectors
2011-06-17T15:50:11  <dhackner> and to enable us to run some jquery stuff like w/autocomplete
2011-06-17T15:50:13  <jarib> SE1 injects sizzle
2011-06-17T15:50:41  <jarib> so you're able use anything sizzle supports with SE1

2011-06-17T15:56:29  <dhackner> so how can i do things in SE2 like ""jquery=.alert_yellow:visible""
2011-06-17T15:59:29  <jarib> just do the filtering on the client, e.g. in ruby: driver.find_elements(:class => "alert_yellow").select { |e| e.displayed? }
2011-06-17T16:02:47  <dhackner> gotcha
