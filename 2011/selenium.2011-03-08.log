2011-03-08T01:08:22  <aikie> Hi all, can somebody explain me how selenium handles character encoding in java tests and the page content in different drivers.
2011-03-08T01:09:01  <aikie> my test all run fine in firefox, but when running them against internet explorer they all fail because of encoding issues

2011-03-08T01:26:34  <jarib> aikie: interesting - using Se2?
2011-03-08T01:27:27  <aikie> yes
2011-03-08T01:27:28  <jarib> i have noticed the firefox driver "just works" when it comes to encodings (i.e. returns UTF-8 regardless of the SUT)
2011-03-08T01:27:42  <jarib> let me do a quick test in IE
2011-03-08T01:29:21  *** rbalent has joined #selenium
2011-03-08T01:30:56  <jarib> it seems to return something ISO-8859-1ish even for UTF-8 pages
2011-03-08T01:31:07  <jarib> so probably depends on some more general encoding setting
2011-03-08T01:31:21  <jarib> aikie: we should ask jimevans when he's around.
2011-03-08T01:31:26  <jarib> (he wrote the IE driver)
2011-03-08T01:31:52  <jarib> aikie: how do your tests fail in java?

2011-03-08T01:52:13  <andreasfruhen> Hi all, I am new to Selenium but since I needed some functionality to modify the Useragent and add or modify also other headers I have modified the ProxyHandler. Now I am running into some issues while building a new server. I am running into an issue with the go. It breaks always when I am getting to the ruby tests (F  should be able to get and set speed (FAILED - 1)). Is there any chance just to build the server and the java client?
2011-03-08T01:55:15  <jarib> andreasfruhen: you should update your checkout, that test doesn't exist anymore AFAIK
2011-03-08T01:55:30  <jarib> run `./go -T` to list the available tasks
2011-03-08T01:56:13  <andreasfruhen> ah, great. thanks
2011-03-08T01:56:30  <jarib> ./go selenium-java maybe
2011-03-08T01:56:50  <jarib> ./go selenium-server-standalone
2011-03-08T01:57:30  <jarib> i'm surprised if Se1 doesn't already have a mechanism to modify the user agent though
2011-03-08T01:57:54  <andreasfruhen> that's what I have implemented

2011-03-08T05:50:00  <jon135246> Hi, all.  Maybe I'm lacking Google-fu, but: what's the name of the WebDriver property which controls auto-retries of element-finding operations and failing only after a timeout?
2011-03-08T05:50:27  <jon135246> I'm looking to avoid sleep/wait operations, as usual, and remembered seeing something somewhere about a WebDriver-global setting which helps.
2011-03-08T05:50:28  <jimevans> jon135246: implicit waits.
2011-03-08T05:50:42  <jon135246> Ah - that looks like it.  Thanks, jimevans

2011-03-08T06:06:13  <jimevans> jarib: looking at the native code, we're not doing anything special in IE.
2011-03-08T06:06:28  <jimevans> everything is unicode up until we have to send things back over the wire, and we translate to UTF-8 for transmission.
2011-03-08T06:07:01  <jarib> hmm
2011-03-08T06:07:39  <jarib> i'm definitely getting ISO-8859-1 chars from the text on google.no
2011-03-08T06:07:43  <jarib> but in both browsers
2011-03-08T06:08:08  <jimevans> now, it's possible that for the text, IE returns iso-8859-1 as unicode text, but we're just reporting what we get from the browser.

2011-03-08T06:34:49  <Frankie-T> Hi. Can someone please help me with a problem, which seems to be IE related? I'm getting "Access denied" when trying to execute the command "selectFrame"
2011-03-08T06:35:12  <jimevans> are your frames hosting content from different domains?
2011-03-08T06:35:55  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-03-08T06:36:02  <Frankie-T> that's a possibility
2011-03-08T06:36:10  <Frankie-T> in FF it's working
2011-03-08T06:36:12  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-08T06:36:27  <Frankie-T> I can't really tell if it's the same domain
2011-03-08T06:36:48  <jimevans> if so, and particularly if the domains are in different zones (one an "intranet" site, one an "internet" site), you'll likely run into problems.
2011-03-08T06:37:21  *** Archdude has quit IRC
2011-03-08T06:37:26  <Frankie-T> is there any way to work around this problem
2011-03-08T06:37:40  <Frankie-T> like "-ignoreDiffrentDomains" :)
2011-03-08T06:37:43  <jimevans> this is selenium 1, right?
2011-03-08T06:37:54  <Frankie-T> it's actually vaadin testbench
2011-03-08T06:38:06  *** Archdude has joined #selenium
2011-03-08T06:38:52  <jimevans> yes, but the script you're running is using the Se1.x (or "Selenium RC") api, right? (If the script was recorded using Selenium IDE, the answer is "yes").
2011-03-08T06:39:38  <Frankie-T> then yes :)
2011-03-08T06:40:07  <jimevans> okay, then someone who knows more about Se1 is going to have to chime in here. adamgoucher?
2011-03-08T06:42:12  <adamgoucher> if you change it from *iexplore to *iehta does it work?
2011-03-08T06:50:01  <Frankie-T> in test.xml
2011-03-08T06:50:03  <Frankie-T> ?
2011-03-08T06:50:16  <Frankie-T> instead of winxp-ie8?

2011-03-08T07:47:39  <xirkus_> anyone know if the WebDriver API exposes newly created window handles through events? I would like to have a way to catch the generated window handles and associate them with some of my own test objects.
2011-03-08T07:48:13  <jimevans> xirkus_: not through events. sorry.
2011-03-08T07:56:19  <xirkus_> jimevans: thanks for the info. My problem is that when I use the getWindowHandle()/getWindowHandles() methods, it is difficult to distinguish between the existing window from which another is openned. It would be nice if there was a way to get the newly created window handle without having to iterate over all open windows.
2011-03-08T07:58:00  <jimevans> i don't necessarily disagree. having said that, finding a cross-browser, cross-language mechanism for that i think would be challenging.

2011-03-08T07:59:26  <xirkus_> jimevans: true enough.

2011-03-08T08:04:14  <xirkus_> jimevans: care to elaborate?
2011-03-08T08:05:26  <jimevans> it's been a couple of weeks since i've had a chance to dig into it, and i'm heads-down trying to fix the automation atoms problems introduced by the scoping fix
2011-03-08T08:05:59  <jimevans> if memory serves, the main problem was targeting differing versions of the msbuild tools via the albacore framework.
2011-03-08T08:06:14  <xirkus_> jimevans: np. I thought I give it a wack this weekend. Any pointers would be helpful.
2011-03-08T08:06:20  <jimevans> i'm sure the problems can be overcome, but fixing crashes and functionality in the ie driver has to be the top priority.
2011-03-08T08:06:31  <xirkus_> jimevans: understood.

2011-03-08T11:18:24  <jimevans> g'day simonstewart.
2011-03-08T11:18:30  <simonstewart> hi jimevans
2011-03-08T11:18:54  <rethus> simonstewart: k, try this.
2011-03-08T11:19:26  <jimevans> what does anyone know about the "location in view" atom?
2011-03-08T11:19:47  <simonstewart> Other than "not much"?
2011-03-08T11:19:48  <rethus> i didn't found this "RenderedWebElement" on command list.
2011-03-08T11:20:18  <simonstewart> http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/RenderedWebElement.html#isDisplayed()
2011-03-08T11:20:20  <simonstewart> It's there
2011-03-08T11:20:21  * jimevans thinks rethus is probably using SeIDE
2011-03-08T11:20:48  <rethus> right
2011-03-08T11:20:56  <simonstewart> Ah. That's different
2011-03-08T11:21:15  <rethus> is there also a selenium server-application for doing debugging jobs?
2011-03-08T11:21:30  <simonstewart> Use "isVisible" to check the particular span you're interested in
2011-03-08T11:21:30  *** sara_ has joined #selenium
2011-03-08T11:22:00  <rethus> k, but how can i loop to all span which inside <div id=content> ?
2011-03-08T11:22:08  <adamgoucher> you dont
2011-03-08T11:22:25  <rethus> problem is, the id of the span-element is a random-string
2011-03-08T11:22:32  <adamgoucher> se-ide doesnt do loops
2011-03-08T11:22:33  <rethus> so i didn't know it before
2011-03-08T11:22:56  <adamgoucher> how random? random random or a-part-is-static-but-a-part-is-random random?

2011-03-08T11:23:11  <rethus> no, completly random random :)
2011-03-08T11:23:34  <adamgoucher> export to a rc/webdriver language
2011-03-08T11:24:16  <simonstewart> WebDriver if you want to find multiple elements
2011-03-08T11:24:42  <adamgoucher> rc can do that too :P
2011-03-08T11:25:42  *** sara_ has quit IRC

2011-03-08T11:32:57  <jqp> i'm having trouble getting a simple testng class to run in eclipse (actually springsource tools suite).  i've got 'selenium-java-2.0.jar', 'testng-5.14.1.jar', and 'selenium-server-standalone-2.0b2.jar' all in my java project's build path, but when i run foo.xml as a TestNG Suite i get the error message "Couldn't contact the RemoteTestNG client.  Make sure you don't have an older version of...
2011-03-08T11:32:58  <jqp> ...testng.jar on your class path.  Reason: Timeout while trying to contact RemoteTestNG."
2011-03-08T11:34:40  <jqp> any ideas on how i could fix this?  i'm new to selenium 2, running selenium servers via eclipse and selenium-in-java generally
2011-03-08T11:38:33  <simonstewart> This sounds more like a testng problem
2011-03-08T11:38:55  <simonstewart> Or a java one, with too many copies of test ng on the path
2011-03-08T11:39:16  <simonstewart> If you're not using the remote server, you can probably just do with the sleneium-java-2.0b2.jar in the classpath
2011-03-08T11:39:29  <simonstewart> (that is, drop the selenium-server one unless you need it)
2011-03-08T11:39:51  <simonstewart> If you keep the selenium-sever-standalone you can drop the selenium-java jar, because the former includes the latter
2011-03-08T11:54:11  <Archdude> anyone here use python?

2011-03-08T12:26:28  <antlong> Archdude, the only way to effectively do it, is to write the logic in do_command, to run on_error if on_error exists, otherwise your code will be filled with try: some_command: except: on_error()

2011-03-08T13:08:45  <jimevans> it's not a critical bug to me, i've just avoided ignoring the test in the .NET bindings just to make sure I remember to bug someone about it.

2011-03-08T19:22:19  <caine607> Hello.
2011-03-08T19:24:32  <caine607> I'm trying to get Selenium set up and I'm thoroughly confused.  Where I work we have a lab with something like a dozen linux boxes running redhat of some sort (a few ubuntu), mostly headless (no monitors).  I'm trying to use them to loadtest a GWT based web app.  The boss types want me to test via a browser (i.e. not via htmlUnit).  What Selenium tools/components SHOULD I be using?
2011-03-08T19:25:10  <caine607> It's a fairly simple webapp.
2011-03-08T19:25:46  <caine607> So basically user clicks on a map graphic, waits 5 to 10 seconds, maybe clicks a button, enters a message to another user and clicks a button, repeat.
2011-03-08T19:26:28  <caine607> I'd love to be able to run multiple 'users' per machine.  (Some of these machines are quad cores with lotsa RAM.)
2011-03-08T19:26:58  <caine607> I've created a selenium user and installed Selenium Grid on three machines (so far) and also am trying to use the IDE to create an initial script.
2011-03-08T19:27:12  <caine607> This is where I kinda run into mass confusion about what exactly is what and what I need to use/do.
2011-03-08T19:28:39  <caine607> I've been wondering if maybe I should set up some kind of VMware instances, for instance.
2011-03-08T19:30:18  <ian_mac> you probably don't need VMware instances
2011-03-08T19:30:24  <ian_mac> though you could go that route
2011-03-08T19:30:49  <caine607> ko.
2011-03-08T19:31:02  <caine607> So I'm confused about WebDriver vs Selenium RC and all that.
2011-03-08T19:31:07  <ian_mac> ahhh
2011-03-08T19:31:11  <caine607> I mean, literally confused.
2011-03-08T19:31:13  <ian_mac> well
2011-03-08T19:31:16  <ian_mac> it can be confusing
2011-03-08T19:31:20  <ian_mac> so
2011-03-08T19:31:23  <ian_mac> Selenium RC
2011-03-08T19:31:28  <ian_mac> is the original selenium
2011-03-08T19:31:45  <ian_mac> and it basically controls your browser by getting it to load a javascript page that proxies requests
2011-03-08T19:31:58  <ian_mac> Webdriver is supposed to be a more direct interface to the browser
2011-03-08T19:32:24  <ian_mac> I've not done much with webdriver
2011-03-08T19:32:30  <ian_mac> whatl anguage to you plan on writing tests in?
2011-03-08T19:32:45  <caine607> Ahhhhhh
2011-03-08T19:32:49  <caine607> I never got tha part.
2011-03-08T19:32:55  <ian_mac> so
2011-03-08T19:32:56  <caine607> Java probably.
2011-03-08T19:33:01  <ian_mac> I write in PHP
2011-03-08T19:33:04  <ian_mac> which means that
2011-03-08T19:33:07  <ian_mac> I have a PHP script
2011-03-08T19:33:08  <caine607> That is, I never got that 1.0 still ran from inside the browser.
2011-03-08T19:33:14  <ian_mac> right
2011-03-08T19:33:15  <caine607> I do know php too.
2011-03-08T19:33:16  <ian_mac> so that means
2011-03-08T19:33:17  <ian_mac> in my case
2011-03-08T19:33:37  <ian_mac> I run a PHP script (in phpunit), it talks over a socket to the Selenium RC server
2011-03-08T19:33:48  <ian_mac> the Selenium RC server opens up a browser on the machine it is running on
2011-03-08T19:33:51  <ian_mac> and runs the tests
2011-03-08T19:34:13  <ian_mac> in your case, phpunit (or Java or whatever) would talk to Selenium Grid
2011-03-08T19:34:23  <ian_mac> which would then proxy those requests to Selenium RC servers
2011-03-08T19:34:41  <caine607> OK, now I'm starting to see.
2011-03-08T19:34:51  <caine607> So I can still go pre-webdriver.
2011-03-08T19:34:56  <caine607> And I guess maybe I should.
2011-03-08T19:35:13  <ian_mac> IIUC a selenium RC server can only run one browser at a time (though I could be wrong), so you'd have to load multiple RC servers using different ports
2011-03-08T19:35:16  <ian_mac> and attach those to your grid
2011-03-08T19:35:24  <caine607> Ahh.
2011-03-08T19:35:31  <ian_mac> if you're using Java Webdriver is fairly well supported
2011-03-08T19:35:33  <caine607> Do they need to have a 'head'?
2011-03-08T19:35:36  <ian_mac> for PHP, at this point, not too much
2011-03-08T19:35:44  <caine607> WebDriver via selenium grid you mean?
2011-03-08T19:35:44  <ian_mac> well, they don't
2011-03-08T19:35:50  <ian_mac> well
2011-03-08T19:35:50  <caine607> Or webdriver outside of selenium?
2011-03-08T19:36:06  <ian_mac> well
2011-03-08T19:36:10  <ian_mac> so the projects merged
2011-03-08T19:36:11  <ian_mac> sec
2011-03-08T19:36:13  <caine607> Yeah.
2011-03-08T19:36:56  <puff> If I understand correctly, webdrive is kinda like the java robot class, i.e. the browser app thinks it's recieving input events mediated by the OS.
2011-03-08T19:37:39  <ian_mac> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/selenium$20developers$20docs$20naming/selenium-developers/4f0MSk09UOw/discussion
2011-03-08T19:38:02  <ian_mac> there's a whole thread on the naming conventions
2011-03-08T19:38:28  <ian_mac> of Selenium vs. Webdriver
2011-03-08T19:39:18  <caine607> Ok. I'll read that.
2011-03-08T19:40:02  <caine607> Ok, so, webdriver is well supported by/in selenium?
2011-03-08T19:40:39  <ian_mac> well
2011-03-08T19:40:53  <ian_mac> basically the Selenium project and Webdriver project merged
2011-03-08T19:41:05  <puff> Damn, I hate it when sites use embedded frames.
2011-03-08T19:42:09  <caine607> ian_mac:  I read the "brief history" in the docs but I couldn't figure out what was what, i.e. where to start.
2011-03-08T19:42:43  <ian_mac> as a Java user you're probably best to start with webdriver
2011-03-08T19:42:50  <ian_mac> and use remote
2011-03-08T19:42:52  <ian_mac> though
2011-03-08T19:43:04  <ian_mac> I don't know how well Grid supports webdriver
2011-03-08T19:43:08  <caine607> Aieeee.  RC is now "RC + RemoteWebDriver" and being called Selenium Server... that explains THAT bit of confusion.
2011-03-08T19:43:08  <ian_mac> so if that is important to you
2011-03-08T19:43:20  <caine607> well do I really need grid to scale  up?
2011-03-08T19:43:26  <caine607> I can fake it with shell scripts if needed.
2011-03-08T19:43:30  <ian_mac> yeah
2011-03-08T19:43:35  <ian_mac> if you're willing to do that, you don't
2011-03-08T19:43:39  <caine607> I.e. have N machines all run the thign at the same time from one script.
2011-03-08T19:43:53  <caine607> Cause it's the same exact script almost. (just different  user logins.)
2011-03-08T19:44:13  <caine607> Ok, cool.
2011-03-08T19:44:30  <caine607> So I wantn webdriver + remote.. which would be Selenium Server?
2011-03-08T19:44:34  <caine607> Hmm
2011-03-08T19:45:08  <caine607> Doh, I JUST noticed that the thread you posted the URL to is like 6 days ago.
2011-03-08T19:52:37  <puff> Man, now I'm just more confused from reading that thread :-).

2011-03-08T19:54:45  <caine607> Heh.  Me too.
2011-03-08T19:56:47  <caine607> ian_mac: You've been very helpful, thanks.  The last thing I'm worried about is about whether I can do this with linux boxes without monitors.
2011-03-08T19:58:08  <ian_mac> yes
2011-03-08T19:58:45  <ian_mac> your browser will need an X server
2011-03-08T19:58:53  <ian_mac> but you can use Xvfb or something like that to do it
2011-03-08T19:59:08  <caine607> Thanks!
2011-03-08T20:05:01  <puff> ian_mac: So, if you're testing a google-maps like app, i.e. you have lots of images and you're dragging the view around and clicking on icons on the map... does webdriver work for that?

2011-03-08T20:05:17  <puff> I'm reading this now http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#firefox-driver
2011-03-08T20:05:33  <puff> ... and it seems to imply that webdrive actions mostly take place via xpath on the dom.
2011-03-08T20:11:44  <antlong> javascript xpath

2011-03-08T20:13:14  <ian_mac> I haven't really used webdriver, so couldn't say
2011-03-08T20:13:36  <puff> Cool, thanks anyway.
2011-03-08T20:13:46  <puff> Ah, neat: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html#getting-visual-information-and-drag-and-drop
2011-03-08T20:14:13  <caine607> Buh, can you believe the hacked up local version of linux at this school doesn't include xvfb?  Why the heck...
2011-03-08T20:14:56  <caine607> So I'm getting it from xfree86.org.
2011-03-08T20:22:00  *** cpg is now known as cpg|away
2011-03-08T20:26:42  <puff> I'm not sure what's going on here, but I'm trying to use selenium IDE to record and then play back a sequence of actions.  It seems like every time I hit the "Play the test suite" button, the first thing it does is reload the page.
2011-03-08T20:26:48  <puff> Which messes things up.
2011-03-08T20:31:12  <antlong> yeah because your first action is probably open.
2011-03-08T20:31:25  <antlong> p.p
2011-03-08T20:40:08  <puff> I deleted the open action, it still happens.
