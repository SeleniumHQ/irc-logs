[2014-08-04 00:27:46] Timvde: Hi. I am using Python. I have defined an element in an @property method (its implementation is just |self.driver.find_element_by_id("...")|). Isn't it possible to use this element in |expected_conditions.visibility_of(self.elem)|? I'm getting NoSuchElementException :(
[2014-08-04 00:27:53] Timvde: (But that's the whole point, of course)

[2014-08-04 02:10:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Joe_____: eclipse has nothing to do with how to write code. I assume you mean using java, and to retrieve an element using java you can use the WebDriver's findElement method
[2014-08-04 02:11:23] WhereIsMySpoon: if you want to actually check whether an element is present without throwing an error if it is not, you can use WebDriver's findElements (notice the 's') method, and check that the length of it is greater than 0
[2014-08-04 02:12:25] Dave_B_: Timvde: if the menu is the same I'd personally jsut create one, but you could make a second one if you like. As for submenus - it's more a code style question than a webdriver question but you could always think about how you'd like to interact with it - would submenu objects make a clearer flow, or just make it messy?
[2014-08-04 02:12:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: you're using the page object model right?

[2014-08-04 02:13:16] WhereIsMySpoon: If so, I think what I'd do is make your menu page object with all of the common items, then maybe make getters for those items that only appear when logged in so that when you create your menu Page Object it doesnt try to retrieve them

[2014-08-04 02:14:31] WhereIsMySpoon: what you could do is create a BaseMenuPage
[2014-08-04 02:14:37] WhereIsMySpoon: then a sub object that inherits it
[2014-08-04 02:14:41] Joe_____: Thanks, <WhereIsMySpoon>.
[2014-08-04 02:14:43] WhereIsMySpoon: which is LoggedInMenuPage
[2014-08-04 02:14:51] WhereIsMySpoon: that way you dont have to duplicate items

[2014-08-04 05:32:06] [1]JP: Selenium Webdriver "drives" the browser. The testing aspect comes from the framework beneath it (JUnit, NUnit etc - even your own)

[2014-08-04 05:32:31] Reddy: how to store objects in Selenium
[2014-08-04 05:32:37] barancev|2: and a framework usually includes: a CI server (e.g. jenkins), a builder (e.g. maven or ant), a testing framework (e.g. junit or testng), and selenium as a cherrypick
[2014-08-04 05:33:02] barancev|2: you can't store objects with selenium. you can only automate browsers. that's it
[2014-08-04 05:33:52] Reddy: means everything here is Descriptive
[2014-08-04 05:34:05] barancev|2: if you want a combined solution that provides anything out of the box you'd better consider commercial tools
[2014-08-04 05:34:21] barancev|2: opensource tools are like a lego bricks
[2014-08-04 05:34:31] barancev|2: that you can use to build a robot

[2014-08-04 05:34:55] [1]JP: Yep, they give you the parts but you have to build it yourself
[2014-08-04 05:36:20] Reddy: fire bug is enough or IDE also required to get object properties
[2014-08-04 05:36:42] barancev|2: firebug is better
[2014-08-04 05:37:01] barancev|2: but firebug is not a recorder
[2014-08-04 05:37:22] barancev|2: selenium ide is a recorder, but its "inspector" is far from excellent

[2014-08-04 06:03:33] barancev: jimevans: hi! can we add a registry check for Ie11 settings (FEATURE_BFCACHE) like it is implemented already for protected mode and scale?
[2014-08-04 06:03:50] jimevans: barancev: we could. i'm not going to though.
[2014-08-04 06:04:08] barancev: otherwise, we have to ask everybody in the tracker "have you tuned the registry for IE11"
[2014-08-04 06:04:38] barancev: or do we expect Microsoft to fix this?
[2014-08-04 06:04:43] jimevans: i understand why you're asking. i just don't have time to do it. it's not as simple as the other checks, because it involves casing on 32- vs 64-bit.
[2014-08-04 06:04:50] jimevans: (which isn't trivial to discover)
[2014-08-04 06:04:58] barancev: oh!
[2014-08-04 06:05:09] dale_fukami, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-04 06:05:23] jimevans: plus it's more complicated than that.
[2014-08-04 06:05:48] jimevans: it's not just "is your OS 32-bit". it's also "is your executable 32-bit, running on a 64-bit OS"
[2014-08-04 06:06:51] rodrigomartin, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-04 06:08:58] jimevans: but when the MSFT implementation goes live and fully released (not just in a dev channel), that will obviate the fix. i'm spending as little time fixing IE11-only issues as possible, because a better solution is coming.

[2014-08-04 06:35:37] spacebarbarian: is there any way with chromedriver to get the http status / whether a page loaded or not ?
[2014-08-04 06:36:06] jimevans: spacebarbarian: those are mutually exclusive things.
[2014-08-04 06:36:33] jimevans: well maybe not mutually exclusive, but certainly orthoginal
[2014-08-04 06:37:00] spacebarbarian: jimevans, right, lets say i want to just know if a page loaded(200/302 etc) or just was a 404 / 403 etc ?
[2014-08-04 06:37:17] jimevans: the webdriver api doesn't give you any direct way to do that, no.
[2014-08-04 06:37:53] jimevans: see http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/07/webdriver-y-u-no-have-http-status-codes.html

[2014-08-04 09:01:21] WhereIsMySpoon: if its safaridriver why would you be testing it for other browsers
[2014-08-04 09:01:28] WhereIsMySpoon: how would you even test it for other browsers
[2014-08-04 09:01:37] WhereIsMySpoon: or is this a change to the selenium core

[2014-08-04 09:02:53] jimevans: jleyba made several changes over the last little while. one of them included changes in the safari driver. another of them had to do with promises flow in the javascript code.
[2014-08-04 09:03:20] jimevans: and the latter gets tested on all browsers.
[2014-08-04 09:03:42] WhereIsMySpoon: ah ok ^^

[2014-08-04 11:58:37] KaibutsuX: does anyone here use phantomJS? I'm looking into as a way to speed up our pre-commit tests so we can run a script locally without having to submit a test remotely and wait for it to come back. I'm really wondering what the primary difference between webdriver and PhantomJS is? I realize that webdriver allows a test in Firefox/IE while Phantom is only webkit, but outside that, is there any other real differnence in the end results?
[2014-08-04 12:01:27] Timvde: PhantomJS does the same thing, but without opening a GUI

[2014-08-04 12:03:25] lukeis: so "what's the difference between webdriver and PhantomJS"  doesn't make sense as a question :)

[2014-08-04 12:47:26] AutomatedTester: but... if your JS is simple then phantomjs should be fine
[2014-08-04 12:47:35] AutomatedTester: KaibutsuX: you could have a look at SlimerJS

[2014-08-04 12:50:20] KaibutsuX: so you still have to have firefox installed?

[2014-08-04 13:14:12] lukeis: i think when i've been in that area it's been to MSP
[2014-08-04 13:14:40] lukeis: AutomatedTester: where ya goin? :)
[2014-08-04 13:14:46] AutomatedTester: lukeis: PDX
[2014-08-04 13:14:56] AutomatedTester: but apparently there are no direct flights :(
[2014-08-04 13:15:08] AutomatedTester: at least from London
[2014-08-04 13:15:21] lukeis: seems like overshooting, but LHR -> LAX -> PDX would be decent? (except I hate LAX customs…)
[2014-08-04 13:15:30] lukeis: or maybe Ontario
[2014-08-04 13:15:40] lukeis: *california ;)
[2014-08-04 13:16:00] AutomatedTester: well the travel site I must use is suggesting LHR -> SFO -> PDX
[2014-08-04 13:16:11] lukeis: wouldn't be horrible
[2014-08-04 13:16:38] lukeis: SFO -> PDX is like 1.5 hours? maybe 2
[2014-08-04 13:16:48] AutomatedTester: yea, plus a 2 hrs layover
[2014-08-04 13:17:05] AutomatedTester: but when I am travelling nearly half the world I prefer to go direct
[2014-08-04 13:17:13] lukeis: yes, me too
[2014-08-04 13:18:36] lukeis: most direct from LHR as layovers go, seem to be MSP or Denver, but I'm not sure if you can get those as one stop hops :)
[2014-08-04 13:19:39] lukeis: can't believe there's no PDX -> LHR
[2014-08-04 13:20:06] AutomatedTester: nope

[2014-08-04 13:21:15] AutomatedTester: anyway...
[2014-08-04 13:21:28] AutomatedTester: might just do via SFO
[2014-08-04 13:21:33] AutomatedTester: I know that place backwards
[2014-08-04 13:22:02] lukeis: i'll wave high in proximity when you're there ;)
[2014-08-04 13:23:21] lukeis: AutomatedTester: oh, had a thought about LHR -> SEA -> PDX :)
[2014-08-04 13:23:31] AutomatedTester: could do that too
[2014-08-04 13:23:48] lukeis: the last bit you could drive ;)
[2014-08-04 13:24:01] garndt: ORD is not bad (reading back mesages)
[2014-08-04 13:24:09] garndt: but people living near ORD might be crazy :)
[2014-08-04 13:24:14] AutomatedTester: garndt: have you been drinking again?
[2014-08-04 13:24:17] lukeis: but then you'd be close to hugs ;)
[2014-08-04 13:24:35] AutomatedTester: garndt: everyone knows not to fly through ORD
[2014-08-04 13:25:22] garndt: AutomatedTester: I didn't think it's been *that* bad.  Of course I haven't had to deal with it being a connection point
[2014-08-04 13:25:32] garndt: I dont' think I trust them to transfer my stuff from one plane to another or get me there on time
[2014-08-04 13:25:33] AutomatedTester: lukeis: I found a direct flight LHR -> PDX
[2014-08-04 13:25:36] AutomatedTester: but its US Airways
[2014-08-04 13:25:46] AutomatedTester: AND it's at 07:45
[2014-08-04 13:26:00] garndt: AutomatedTester: is this for December?
[2014-08-04 13:26:03] AutomatedTester: no way I can get to LHR for doing security
[2014-08-04 13:26:08] AutomatedTester: garndt: no september
[2014-08-04 13:26:19] AutomatedTester: garndt: in December I wont have to book my flights :)
[2014-08-04 13:26:32] lukeis: yeah, you'd have to spend the night in london ;)
[2014-08-04 13:26:33] AutomatedTester: there are people who will do that for me ;)
