[2014-08-05 08:26:40] jimevans: it's legacy. used to be the way to create an array variable in basic. was overloaded in vb to be the way to declare any variable.

[2014-08-05 10:55:48] jleyba: IIRC, Ken was trying to solve the problem of a user wanting to click on a menu item that was in motion
[2014-08-05 10:56:04] jleyba: and the computed click coordinates were no longer accurate when it went to execute the click
[2014-08-05 10:56:16] jimevans: which they eventually punted on, saying, "we just can't do that".

[2014-08-05 10:57:21] jleyba: Pretty sure it's a problem common to all driver implementations, Chrome just returns an error rather than blindly clicking
[2014-08-05 10:58:13] jleyba: actually, it might not be a problem for Safari since coordinates+click are all executed in the ui thread
[2014-08-05 10:58:39] jimevans: jleyba: or clicking on the obscured element, like firefoxdriver does with native events disabled
[2014-08-05 11:00:05] jleyba: you could argue that violates the spirit of the isDisplayed precondition

[2014-08-05 11:20:06] AutomatedTester: jleyba: no they dont
[2014-08-05 11:20:23] jimevans: jleyba: if they do, they don't expose it to the developer in any meaningful and consistent way.
[2014-08-05 11:20:53] AutomatedTester: they dont expose it (currently) because they change how things are rendered to make pages load faster
[2014-08-05 11:21:07] AutomatedTester: if we only cared about the viewport things might be different
[2014-08-05 11:21:19] AutomatedTester: but there are edge cases
[2014-08-05 11:21:20] AutomatedTester: literally
[2014-08-05 11:22:24] AutomatedTester: jleyba: the other issue is if browsers start doing parallel rendering, as shown in servo, we then go into a world of race conditions
[2014-08-05 11:22:47] AutomatedTester: "is it rendered? not at this precise moment but I am still downloading so who knows"

[2014-08-05 11:24:06] AutomatedTester: jleyba: because our JS is run like all other JS and we hope we are blocking any JS running
[2014-08-05 11:24:22] AutomatedTester: but now that CSS does things that required JS we are already struggling

[2014-08-05 11:26:44] goosemo: via the changelog it should
[2014-08-05 11:26:49] goosemo: that went out in 2.41.0
[2014-08-05 11:26:54] jleyba: jimevans: I'm being serious. We should try to leverage the full power of the useragent instead of constantly playing catch up with increasingly complicated algorithms
[2014-08-05 11:27:21] jimevans: jleyba: i know you're being serious. it's a serious problem. i was just trying to inject a little levity.
[2014-08-05 11:27:58] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I spoke to one of the module owners about this in gecko and he suggested we just walk away
[2014-08-05 11:28:00] jimevans: the problem is, that to get consistent behaviour across user agents, you have to specify the algorithm that says "this is visible"
[2014-08-05 11:28:16] jimevans: s/visible/displayed/
[2014-08-05 11:28:35] AutomatedTester: jleyba: the web perf WG is trying to describe this because Google want to know if ads are displayed or not
[2014-08-05 11:28:37] jimevans: it's not enough to just say "if a user can see it, it's displayed"
[2014-08-05 11:28:44] jleyba: jimevans: that algorithm exists as part of HTML
[2014-08-05 11:28:55] AutomatedTester: jleyba: link?
[2014-08-05 11:29:07] jimevans: yes, link please.
[2014-08-05 11:29:24] goosemo: AutomatedTester: where is the supported version mapping kept, since the changelog seems to conflict what you're saying?

[2014-08-05 11:29:57] AutomatedTester: goosemo: um... good question
[2014-08-05 11:30:00] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ^
[2014-08-05 11:30:10] jimevans: and does it handle elements being obscured/outside overflow areas/etc. because the expectation of "isDisplayed" is that "i can see it on the screen"
[2014-08-05 11:31:02] jimevans: 2.42.x should support native events for firefox 29, 28, 24, and 17.
[2014-08-05 11:31:03] AutomatedTester: jleyba: also remember that from an a11y point of view, an element not displayed might still be interactable
[2014-08-05 11:31:17] jleyba: goosemo: yeah probably should be supported https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/selenium-2.42.2/javascript/firefox-driver/extension/chrome.manifest#L63
[2014-08-05 11:31:33] jimevans: (because we haven't released native events libs for 30 or 31 yet)
[2014-08-05 11:31:56] AutomatedTester: jleyba: but from a spec point of view we need to rely on hit testing definition which every WG goes "Not me"

[2014-08-05 11:41:57] AutomatedTester: at that precise point
[2014-08-05 11:41:58] jimevans: because sometimes you can't scroll the element into view manually, but can using scrollIntoView.
[2014-08-05 11:42:20] AutomatedTester: also... what if the center of the element is covered but the corners arent
[2014-08-05 11:42:20] jleyba: another issue, which we don't handle now, is "is element X displayed if it's within the viewport yet completely obscured by another element with a greater z-index"

[2014-08-05 11:43:09] jleyba: and do what instead?
[2014-08-05 11:43:17] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-05 11:43:21] jimevans: AutomatedTester: so, just let people click on an element, and if another element is in the way, dem's da berries?
[2014-08-05 11:43:49] jleyba: two issues then: (1) isDisplayed as a manipulation precondition
[2014-08-05 11:43:50] jimevans: (that's what i meant by "how would that work?")
[2014-08-05 11:43:54] AutomatedTester: jimevans: at which point... do we really care about displayed?
[2014-08-05 11:44:01] jleyba: (2) isDisplayed as an independent query
[2014-08-05 11:44:39] jleyba: we could get rid of (1) and change click/etc to "get location of element, click at that point, regardless of whether element would receive click"
[2014-08-05 11:45:12] AutomatedTester: i'm ok with that
[2014-08-05 11:45:19] jleyba: i am too
[2014-08-05 11:45:29] jleyba: for (2), do we tell users to check CSS properties and size on their own?
[2014-08-05 11:46:01] AutomatedTester: properties... are you trolling? :D
[2014-08-05 11:46:03] jimevans: AutomatedTester: time to play devil's advocate. if i say "click on this element that i've searched for and gotten the reference to" and another element gets the click and potentially goes to some entirely different page than i expect, are we really okay with telling users tough luck?
[2014-08-05 11:46:37] jleyba: jimevans: "The user-agent SHOULD check that the target element will actually receive the click"

[2014-08-05 11:47:13] jleyba: AutomatedTester: yes I will troll on that. I think the current behavior of WebElement.getAttribute is shit
[2014-08-05 11:47:19] AutomatedTester: a user would click in that area and get the wrong page
[2014-08-05 11:47:26] jleyba: And our users need to educate themselves if they don't know the difference b/w an attribute and a property
[2014-08-05 11:47:39] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I agree and fought your corner
[2014-08-05 11:47:51] AutomatedTester: iirc we are still waiting on usage data

[2014-08-05 11:48:04] jimevans: AutomatedTester: then i would advocate creating a scroll method above scrollIntoView. the javascript method isn't sufficient.

[2014-08-05 11:49:01] AutomatedTester: jimevans: and css transforms would be handled how?
[2014-08-05 11:49:22] jleyba: jimevans: how is it any different from the current native event approach? compute (x,y) - click
[2014-08-05 11:50:45] jimevans: jleyba: it's not. and it's a source of *HUGE* frustration and confusion to users. pretending it's not confusing is disingenuous at best, and telling people they just need to educate themselves is horribly rude.
[2014-08-05 11:50:45] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I'm deeply troubled by a w3c spec potentially keeping an incorrect API just b/c it has high usage :(
[2014-08-05 11:51:03] AutomatedTester: jleyba: and this is why I would want to remove it

[2014-08-05 11:57:25] goosemo: jimevans: this "native events not supported" issue is a regresion in my grid setup after upgrading to 2.42.2+FF28. I found a related ticket, but it's been marked closed :/
[2014-08-05 11:57:41] jimevans: jleyba: okay. consider this use case: fixed-position footer element. user calls scrollIntoView(false). element scrolls into the viewport, but only enough to be in the viewport, and still obscured by the footer element. click will fail. if your answer is "use scrollIntoView(true)", substitute a fixed-position header instead.
[2014-08-05 11:58:28] jimevans: goosemo: i have no idea what the issue is. and if it's firefox we're talking about i'm going to be pretty useless in trying to troubleshoot it. especially today.
[2014-08-05 11:59:52] goosemo: ok, no worries there, I'm going to revert the FF -> 27.0 and see if there is any change. In regards to a ticket about this issue, I can't reopen this one https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=5891

[2014-08-05 12:07:22] jimevans: AutomatedTester: ^^
[2014-08-05 12:07:33] jimevans: i just laid out the use case
[2014-08-05 12:07:39] jleyba: doesn't account for fixed position
[2014-08-05 12:07:51] jimevans: fixed-position footer element. user calls scrollIntoView(false). element scrolls into the viewport, but only enough to be in the viewport, and still obscured by the footer element. click will fail. if your answer is "use scrollIntoView(true)", substitute a fixed-position header instead
[2014-08-05 12:08:10] AutomatedTester: but I want to click on an element that is position:fixed
[2014-08-05 12:08:30] AutomatedTester: because it has a support contacts (for example)

[2014-08-05 12:11:47] lukeis: typically the effect is limited to the plane(s) jim is on ;)
[2014-08-05 12:12:07] AutomatedTester: anyway... where we saying that that jleyba's algorithm cant work on position:fixed?
[2014-08-05 12:12:16] AutomatedTester: or did I misunderstand?
[2014-08-05 12:12:28] jimevans: yes, that's it in general.
[2014-08-05 12:12:43] AutomatedTester: ok, so what happens when I want to click on it
[2014-08-05 12:13:10] AutomatedTester: because it has, and i am spitballing, a link to the support site
[2014-08-05 12:13:45] jleyba: jimevans: devil's advocate: #evil-div { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width:100%; height:100%}
[2014-08-05 12:13:51] AutomatedTester: ok, kids I have ~15 mins left before I need to walk to the plane
[2014-08-05 12:13:55] jleyba: should webdriver try to account for scrolling other elements into view?
[2014-08-05 12:14:32] jimevans: AutomatedTester: clicking on the fixed position element isn't the problem. clicking the one obscured by the fixed position element is.
[2014-08-05 12:14:54] AutomatedTester: ok... change clicking on it, to under it... what should we do
[2014-08-05 12:14:59] AutomatedTester: error?
[2014-08-05 12:15:10] AutomatedTester: if we call isDisplayed... what should we do
[2014-08-05 12:15:14] AutomatedTester: is it interactable
[2014-08-05 12:15:46] jleyba: why don't we fail and direct users to the interactions api where they can control scrolling?
[2014-08-05 12:15:58] jleyba: make webelement.click() a best effort that may fail in certain scenarios
[2014-08-05 12:16:20] AutomatedTester: re: api for scrolling we agreed to add a scroll method iirc
[2014-08-05 12:16:29] AutomatedTester: just for scrolling
[2014-08-05 12:16:42] jimevans: jleyba: i really dislike that, but i don't see any other clear way to make it work.
[2014-08-05 12:16:57] AutomatedTester: why do you dislike it?
[2014-08-05 12:17:15] AutomatedTester: we are emulating humans which, from what Turing has shown us, is fucking hard
[2014-08-05 12:17:23] jleyba: jimevans: we can't handle the fixed position footer case without handling my #evil-dev scenario above
[2014-08-05 12:17:40] jleyba: and #evil-div indicates there are cases where things will just not be clickable
[2014-08-05 12:18:09] jimevans: which is why i said "i don't see any other clear way". i should've said "but if that's the best we can do, i'll live"
[2014-08-05 12:18:28] AutomatedTester: :)
[2014-08-05 12:18:54] jimevans: i'm not disagreeing with the approach. it's just a pretty big departure from "just make it work"
[2014-08-05 12:19:03] jimevans: which again, is fine.
[2014-08-05 12:19:14] jimevans: but not what (our) users generally expect.
[2014-08-05 12:19:25] AutomatedTester: so the people who said... just make it work dont actually work on a UA
[2014-08-05 12:19:36] jleyba: this is where proper error messaging comes into play
[2014-08-05 12:20:02] jleyba: so the operation fails but users are directed to the api they can use to make it work
[2014-08-05 12:20:05] AutomatedTester: this is P vs NP hard
[2014-08-05 12:20:17] jimevans: great discussion today, though. very thought-provoking and i think we've gotten some good work done.

[2014-08-05 12:20:56] jleyba: kind of implied at this point
[2014-08-05 12:20:59] AutomatedTester: its implied

[2014-08-05 12:38:37] AutomatedTester: rebelagentm: don't
[2014-08-05 12:38:47] lukeis: heh :)

[2014-08-05 12:38:54] *jleyba agrees'
[2014-08-05 12:39:20] lukeis: the only other one I would say, is to expose a javascript api in the flash app that you can use to 'test' it
[2014-08-05 12:39:26] AutomatedTester: rebelagentm: you could trying flexpilot but... its a hack
[2014-08-05 12:39:26] rebelagentm: Unfortunately, this isn't a matter of whether I want to :)
[2014-08-05 12:39:45] AutomatedTester: you need to instrument the app to make it work
[2014-08-05 12:39:57] jleyba: unit test the hell out of the app
[2014-08-05 12:40:02] lukeis: but then again, this sounds like a non-mobile friendly site :)
[2014-08-05 12:40:20] jleyba: integration testing flash requires hacks, so long term just rely on really strong unit testing
[2014-08-05 12:40:42] rebelagentm: Agreed with everyone
[2014-08-05 12:40:54] AutomatedTester: mobile is the main one for me

[2014-08-05 15:24:27] lukeis, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-05 15:24:39] jimevans: mostly because of the way the driver manages the profile.

[2014-08-05 15:25:15] linuxR: whats the problem with just creating one profile per instance?
[2014-08-05 15:25:47] dborin, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2014-08-05 15:26:08] linuxR: will it work when I manually create the profiles and specify these for each instance?
[2014-08-05 15:26:09] jimevans: there's no problem, except that the capability exists to use an existing profile as a "template", which means it must be copied over to the tmp directory, and launched to "clean up" the profile and verify that it's valid.
[2014-08-05 15:26:46] jimevans: so, if two driver instances attempt to use the same "template" profile, there might be conflicts.
[2014-08-05 15:27:17] linuxR: but I don't need any existing profile
[2014-08-05 15:27:32] jimevans: and there's no way to a priori know which method you're using.
[2014-08-05 15:27:42] jimevans: i'm not sure what the issue is.
[2014-08-05 15:28:01] jimevans: if you're doing *actual* stuff with your driver instances, the launch should be a small part of it.
[2014-08-05 15:28:22] jimevans: (assuming how you're running the code supports parallelization)
[2014-08-05 15:28:54] linuxR: all I would like to do is to run my webdriver-program multiple times, as completely distinct processes
[2014-08-05 15:29:14] jimevans: okay. does it do anything other than launch firefox and exit it?
[2014-08-05 15:29:54] linuxR: currently it's just the webdriver example from documentation which launches a query at google and prints the result
[2014-08-05 15:30:25] jimevans: alright. and how are you starting it?
[2014-08-05 15:30:42] linuxR: by executing the program from command line
[2014-08-05 15:30:53] jimevans: (i'm assuming since you refer to it as a "program" that you're doing this standalone instead of from some testing framework)
[2014-08-05 15:31:00] linuxR: thats correct
[2014-08-05 15:31:28] jimevans: and what happens if you launch it simultaneously from, say, two terminal windows?
[2014-08-05 15:31:49] linuxR: that's what I'm trying to do
[2014-08-05 15:31:52] jimevans: or are you trying to launch multiple instances of firefox from the same command line?

[2014-08-05 15:32:37] linuxR: I'm trying to open two instances of the test program with one instance of firefox each
[2014-08-05 15:32:58] jimevans: okay so here's what's happening when you launch firefox with webdriver. this'll take me a bit, so be patient as i type it in.
[2014-08-05 15:33:04] linuxR: I don't understand how program A can even know about a firefox instance already being present
[2014-08-05 15:33:21] jimevans: let me describe it. please be patient with me.
[2014-08-05 15:33:35] linuxR: okay, thanks in advance :)
[2014-08-05 15:34:12] jimevans: the driver lays down a profile in the temp directory, and attempts to open a socket on a known port.
[2014-08-05 15:34:47] jimevans: once it's successfully opened that socket, it launches firefox once pointed to the profile in the tmp directory with a -silent command line switch
[2014-08-05 15:35:03] jimevans: this fixes up anything in the profile that might not be exactly what firefox expects in its profile.
[2014-08-05 15:35:14] jimevans: that instance of firefox exits silently.
[2014-08-05 15:35:35] jimevans: then the driver relaunches firefox, again pointing to the profile in the tmp directory.
[2014-08-05 15:35:57] jimevans: note that this profile will contain a firefox extension that includes the webdriver code needed to drive firefox.
[2014-08-05 15:36:36] jimevans: the firefox extension starts an HTTP server running on a port specified by the profile (this is done behind the scenes by the firefox driver code when it first lays down the profile)
[2014-08-05 15:37:11] jimevans: then the firefox driver code in whatever language bindings you're using attempts to connect to that HTTP server, since that's how the bindings communicate with the actual driver.
[2014-08-05 15:37:17] lukeis, quitting. (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
[2014-08-05 15:37:46] jimevans: once it either correctly connects to the HTTP server, or times out, the driver then releases the socket opened way back at the beginning.
[2014-08-05 15:38:18] jimevans: now, to get socratic for a moment, what happens if two instances try to open that initial socket on the same (known) port?
[2014-08-05 15:39:00] jimevans: one of those will fail to open the socket, so it falls into a retry loop until it can successfully open the socket.
[2014-08-05 15:39:24] jimevans: essentially, the driver is using the socket on a known port as a mutex, only allowing one instance to be running while that socket is open.
[2014-08-05 15:39:59] linuxR: but why can't just each driver instance create a profile with a different socket?
[2014-08-05 15:40:34] jimevans: the alternative is that when two instances launch at the same time, both driver instances may try to have their internal HTTP servers try to listen on the same port. this is incredibly important, and simply can't be allowed to happen.
[2014-08-05 15:40:57] jimevans: and there's no random number generator in the world that can guarantee that there won't be some occasional overlap.
[2014-08-05 15:41:27] jimevans: remember, there are two ports involved.
[2014-08-05 15:41:44] jimevans: one is the port the HTTP server listens on, the other is simply used as a locking mechanism.
[2014-08-05 15:43:54] jimevans: so, to turn our attention to your specific example, because launching firefox is a fairly expensive operation (because profiles need to be written to disk, which can include any number of firefox extension [and in fact *must* include at least one]), it might be that the second instance has started launching firefox while the first is navigating to google and getting the results, and just not completing the (visible) launch of firefox before the first i
[2014-08-05 15:44:50] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-05 15:45:12] jimevans: the fact of the matter is that the firefox driver needs exclusive (to other instances of firefox) to the system while it's launching firefox to avoid port selection clashes
[2014-08-05 15:46:24] linuxR: I don't understand what the problem with forking a firefox process is
[2014-08-05 15:46:39] jimevans: it's not the process. you're entirely missing the point.
[2014-08-05 15:47:39] jimevans: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriverInternals#Flow_of_Control:_Starting_Firefox
[2014-08-05 15:48:29] jimevans: it's the need to make sure that the firefox driver's HTTP server listens on a unique port.

[2014-08-05 15:50:57] linuxR: I don't yet understand why this is designed this way
[2014-08-05 15:51:34] linuxR: but I really hope that it is somehow possible to run multiple test/browser instances simultanously
[2014-08-05 15:53:01] jimevans: it absolutely is possible. people do it all the time. there are integration tests in the project's test suite that do so without issue.
[2014-08-05 15:54:02] linuxR: so why doesn't it work in my (simple) case?
[2014-08-05 15:56:04] linuxR: usually there is nothing that prevents me of starting multiple instances of an app and have these be executed in parallel
[2014-08-05 15:56:05] jimevans: i don't know. if i had to guess, i suspect it's because launching firefox is a fairly expensive operation. remember that the profile needs to be written to disk, which can include any number of firefox extension (and in fact *must* include at least one), and firefox has to launch twice. my guess would be that the second instance has started launching firefox while the first is navigating to google and getting the results, and the first instance just ha
[2014-08-05 15:56:34] jimevans: no, there's usually nothing that prevents it.
[2014-08-05 15:57:02] jimevans: if you really wanted to test the theory out, switch your test to use chrome instead of firefox.
[2014-08-05 15:57:09] linuxR: but the webdriver design doesn't seem to support this
[2014-08-05 15:57:32] jimevans: we seem to be talking past each other. what gives you that impression?
[2014-08-05 15:58:12] Neo--_, quitting. (Quit: My MacBook Pro has gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
[2014-08-05 15:58:26] linuxR: I don't understand why there just can't be two webdriver instances with one browser instance each (with a different profile each)
[2014-08-05 15:58:34] jimevans: there can be.
[2014-08-05 15:58:39] linuxR: that can start and run at the same time, in parallel
[2014-08-05 15:58:46] linuxR: independent of each other
[2014-08-05 15:59:15] jimevans: the design of the firefox driver doesn't allow the launch to be exactly simultaneous, but that's unique to the firefox implementation.
[2014-08-05 15:59:55] jimevans: and the firefox implementation is certainly capable of manipulating two instances of firefox in parallel, independently of each other.
[2014-08-05 16:00:34] linuxR: so you're basically saying if my tests would run longer, I would see two firefox instances running in parallel?
[2014-08-05 16:00:47] jimevans: yes. that's exactly what i'm saying.
[2014-08-05 16:01:13] linuxR: okay..going to try that.
[2014-08-05 16:01:26] linuxR: why can't firefox be started in parallel?

[2014-08-05 16:02:14] jimevans: dear $deity, i've been going on for about 20 minutes describing why.
[2014-08-05 16:02:25] jimevans: it's because the driver needs to select a unique port to listen on.
[2014-08-05 16:02:38] jimevans: if two instances launch at the same time, they will select the same port.
[2014-08-05 16:03:05] jimevans: if you'd like to change that behavior you're welcome to submit a patch (pull request via github) to that effect.
[2014-08-05 16:03:21] linuxR: why not just check if the port is already taken and select another one if necessary?
[2014-08-05 16:03:22] jimevans: just be aware that it must work (and be tested) on multiple desktop OSes
[2014-08-05 16:03:30] jimevans: because there's a race condition
[2014-08-05 16:04:49] jimevans: instance 1 starts -> sees port 7055 available, instance 2 starts -> sees port 7055 available, instance 1 grabs port 7055, instance 2 tries to grab port 7055, and is denied. now scale that to an arbitrary number of instances.
[2014-08-05 16:05:30] linuxR: why can't instance 2 just use port 7056 when finding 7055 is denied?
[2014-08-05 16:05:31] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-05 16:06:05] jimevans: because suppose instance 3 is launched in between? you can have a cascading effect, whereby you starve certain instances.
[2014-08-05 16:07:05] linuxR: after a number of retries each instance would end up with a free port (as long as there are any), no?
