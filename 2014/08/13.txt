[2014-08-13 02:05:20] ricepuddin: I have a relatively trivial <a> which contains some text and an empty span (which bootstrap turns into a pretty, pretty caret)... using the WebDriverJS bindings (selenium-webdriver in npm) I can select this element but calling getText on it returns undefined. The selector that I'm using works fine (tested in the browser) and returns the correct number of elements.. but all of them give "undefined" when getText is called on them, rather than the
[2014-08-13 02:05:20] ricepuddin: text content of the <a>... has anyone encountered this issue? could the <span> be causing me problems?
[2014-08-13 02:11:14] WhereIsMySpoon: ricepuddin: yes, you need to do getText on the span
[2014-08-13 02:11:32] ricepuddin: WhereIsMySpoon: the span contains no text.
[2014-08-13 02:11:44] WhereIsMySpoon: er
[2014-08-13 02:11:50] WhereIsMySpoon: does the <a> contain any?
[2014-08-13 02:12:14] ricepuddin: the nesting is thus: <a>My Text Here<span class="caret"></span></a>
[2014-08-13 02:12:21] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-13 02:12:49] lampd1, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-08-13 02:12:58] ricepuddin: from getText docs: "Get the visible (i.e. not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing whitespace."
[2014-08-13 02:13:23] ricepuddin: so I would expect getText on the <a> to work regardless of whether the text were in the span or not, tbh
[2014-08-13 02:13:47] ricepuddin: but that's a purely intellectual issue at this stage... the text is in the <a> :)
[2014-08-13 02:13:59] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry, I misunderstood what you read
[2014-08-13 02:14:07] WhereIsMySpoon: yea that woudl make sense
[2014-08-13 02:14:39] WhereIsMySpoon: ricepuddin: and if you try and grab the element with normal js and do innerText on it?
[2014-08-13 02:14:42] WhereIsMySpoon: it returns the text right?
[2014-08-13 02:14:57] WhereIsMySpoon: say you have <a id="asd">My Text Here<span class="caret"></span></a>
[2014-08-13 02:15:02] ricepuddin: forced to admit, not sure how to do that.. I'm relatively new to this...
[2014-08-13 02:15:04] WhereIsMySpoon: then do document.getElementById("asd").innerText
[2014-08-13 02:15:10] WhereIsMySpoon: in your browser console
[2014-08-13 02:15:13] ricepuddin: ah
[2014-08-13 02:15:24] WhereIsMySpoon: make sure your a has an id
[2014-08-13 02:15:55] WhereIsMySpoon: ricepuddin: there arent any iframes are there?
[2014-08-13 02:16:16] WhereIsMySpoon: this <a> isnt in an iframe is it? or..
[2014-08-13 02:17:07] WhereIsMySpoon: if you could :gist the whole page and your selenium code I think it would help..
[2014-08-13 02:17:07] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com

[2014-08-13 02:17:49] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-08-13 02:18:00] ricepuddin: <a> had no id so I added one manually using dev console
[2014-08-13 02:18:00] WhereIsMySpoon: i understand that
[2014-08-13 02:18:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ya
[2014-08-13 02:18:07] ricepuddin: and then did as you asked
[2014-08-13 02:18:16] ricepuddin: innerText returned the correct text, as expected
[2014-08-13 02:18:19] WhereIsMySpoon: right
[2014-08-13 02:18:44] ricepuddin: previously I had been selecting with a css selector... but wouldn't have thought that would make a difference?
[2014-08-13 02:19:07] WhereIsMySpoon: no that shouldnt unless your css selector isnt actually selecting that element
[2014-08-13 02:19:09] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-08-13 02:20:23] ricepuddin: WhereIsMySpoon: I get the right number of undefineds ;)
[2014-08-13 02:20:36] WhereIsMySpoon: whatever that means :p
[2014-08-13 02:20:49] WhereIsMySpoon: i cant really help you unless you provide me with more information about your test code or your html
[2014-08-13 02:20:53] ricepuddin: and using the selector inside $$() on the developer console yields the correct elements
[2014-08-13 02:21:01] operatiay, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-08-13 02:21:11] WhereIsMySpoon: can you provide a skeleton structure of your html maybe?
[2014-08-13 02:21:12] ricepuddin: I understand.. I'll see if I can distill the html down a little to gist it :)
[2014-08-13 02:21:15] WhereIsMySpoon: yea
[2014-08-13 02:21:20] ricepuddin: thanks for now
[2014-08-13 02:21:23] WhereIsMySpoon: basically just what the nesting of that element is like
[2014-08-13 02:23:23] WhereIsMySpoon: ricepuddin: dont forget that $$() is not the same as a webdriver css selector
[2014-08-13 02:23:29] WhereIsMySpoon: just fyi
[2014-08-13 02:24:24] WhereIsMySpoon: document.querySelector is what webdriver uses
[2014-08-13 02:24:40] WhereIsMySpoon: which should be pretty much the same, but is not guaranteed to be the same
[2014-08-13 02:24:45] ricepuddin: WhereIsMySpoon, I know... but getElements() returns the correct number of elements in the array (tested with different datasets, same page)... and then I getText them all and promise.all the resulting promise array
[2014-08-13 02:25:16] WhereIsMySpoon: it returning undefined is a bit weird though
[2014-08-13 02:25:22] WhereIsMySpoon: if they had no text id expect ""
[2014-08-13 02:25:32] WhereIsMySpoon: though im no js expert
[2014-08-13 02:25:58] ricepuddin: I wonder if there's a method to get it to dump the dom of what it selected..?
[2014-08-13 02:27:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ricepuddin: you can do driver.getPageSource
[2014-08-13 02:27:33] WhereIsMySpoon: yea if I have <a id="asd"><span class="caret"></span></a>
[2014-08-13 02:27:38] WhereIsMySpoon: then do document.getElementById("asd").innerText
[2014-08-13 02:27:42] WhereIsMySpoon: the console returns ""
[2014-08-13 02:27:53] WhereIsMySpoon: so something odd is going on I think
[2014-08-13 02:28:10] ricepuddin: that'll bare no fruit... surely that's the static source of the page when it started?
[2014-08-13 02:28:21] ricepuddin: the dom is live edited as you fill out the form...
[2014-08-13 02:28:32] ricepuddin: I'm onto automatic stage 3 of 7 :(
[2014-08-13 02:28:41] ricepuddin: automating*

[2014-08-13 09:12:32] dimacus: you start x11vnc with sudo so it's running as root

[2014-08-13 09:21:52] dude-x: the first thing that happens is that it creates a profile, loads the webdriver extension, and then terminates, and then restarts firefox so that it can load the changes

[2014-08-13 09:33:40] dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: well setting a timeout only exposed that the tests that fail seem to do some file writing
[2014-08-13 09:34:06] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: maybe the problem is with those tests then :)

[2014-08-13 09:36:30] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, your tests
[2014-08-13 09:36:35] WhereIsMySpoon: I thought you meant some selenium tests
[2014-08-13 09:36:36] lukeis: dude-x: not sure i understand… they hang cause the response never comes back?
[2014-08-13 09:36:39] dude-x: i added a timeout to the HTTPConnection in remote_connection.py and see that those tests that fail seem to some file handling (opening a file for upload)
[2014-08-13 09:36:44] dude-x: yes
[2014-08-13 09:36:58] dude-x: although i think the file thing is a coincidence
[2014-08-13 09:37:14] dude-x: started happening around with the last 2 releases of selenium
[2014-08-13 09:37:15] WhereIsMySpoon: oh do you
[2014-08-13 09:37:21] lukeis: sounds like a bug in the driver, rather than the bindings
[2014-08-13 09:37:28] dude-x: yeah
[2014-08-13 09:37:43] WhereIsMySpoon: you shouldnt really be messing with files with selenium :D

[2014-08-13 09:39:42] dude-x: i realy suspect a bug in the ff extension; which is bad because that was usually reliable in not hanging.
[2014-08-13 09:40:54] jleyba: dude-x: if you want to be terrified, look at httpd.js in the firefox extension
[2014-08-13 09:41:13] dude-x: just say javascript and i am already cringing
[2014-08-13 09:41:14] jleyba: and that will also explain why if there's a socket level bug in the http handling, it's likely not going to be fixed by us

[2014-08-13 12:15:04] jeana: i have selenium ide 2.5.0. i just uninstalled and reinstalled it. my problem is that while it records just find and shows data in the table tab, the source tab shows nothing.
[2014-08-13 12:16:03] jeana: i'm using it in firefox 31. this used to work fine. i'm using the side bar option. i've tried looking in the wiki, the group, and the bugs and all i found was bug 7731 which doesn't have a whole lot in it.
[2014-08-13 12:16:16] jeana: i'm sure sure this is user error on my part. what am i missing?
