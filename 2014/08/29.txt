[2014-08-29 05:43:29] lionmancat: Any reccomendations on dealing with apps that frequently crash or will occasionally never complete HTTP requests? I notice on Safari sometimes the web site fails and the browser stales it. I am also noticing it on Firefox now (albiet much less)
[2014-08-29 05:44:35] lionmancat: I have set timeouts at the testng level & selenium grid level and they don't seem to do anything it looks like Selenium thinks the browser is closed but won't let me run another browser session on the machine and my tests won't run until I kill the browser.

[2014-08-29 05:46:23] WhereIsMySpoon: sounds like your app sucks
[2014-08-29 05:46:45] WhereIsMySpoon: your tests will only produce as good a results as your app can respond with
[2014-08-29 05:47:17] WhereIsMySpoon: I cant test whether an apple I throw will get 20miles to the gallon if it doesnt burn any fuel

[2014-08-29 05:48:06] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe I should have said car chassis instead of apple
[2014-08-29 05:48:15] WhereIsMySpoon: in any case
[2014-08-29 05:48:19] lionmancat: WhereIsMySpoon: you are right they do.... :'(
[2014-08-29 05:48:57] WhereIsMySpoon: lionmancat: if your app is only sometimes going to do certain things and other times do other things, on the same action, with no consistency, then your tests are worthless
[2014-08-29 05:49:19] WhereIsMySpoon: fix your app so it's consistent and works, then make automated tests
[2014-08-29 05:49:29] WhereIsMySpoon: or even make the tests before
[2014-08-29 05:49:35] WhereIsMySpoon: but dont expect them to give you useful results
[2014-08-29 05:49:40] WhereIsMySpoon: until your app is fixed
[2014-08-29 05:51:29] lionmancat: So the solution to bad HTTP requests that occur 1/10th of the time is to tell the developers to fix their app?
[2014-08-29 05:52:06] WhereIsMySpoon: lionmancat: let me be a bit more clear maybe. Take this simplified view:
[2014-08-29 05:52:20] WhereIsMySpoon: lionmancat: your test is to click a button that sends a form and updates something, for example
[2014-08-29 05:52:20] lionmancat: If I can't reproduce it consistently my opinion won't be valid.
[2014-08-29 05:52:51] WhereIsMySpoon: 1/10 times this doesn't work, because the app doesn't respond. This means that the thing you're checking to appear doesn't appear, and the test times out and gives you a failure
[2014-08-29 05:53:04] WhereIsMySpoon: You have successfully identified a failure in the app, log a bug and mvoe on
[2014-08-29 05:53:05] WhereIsMySpoon: move*
[2014-08-29 05:53:15] lionmancat: okay.
[2014-08-29 05:53:29] lionmancat: thats an interesting perspective as it makes logical sense :)
[2014-08-29 05:53:38] lionmancat: thanks for the guidance.
[2014-08-29 05:53:53] WhereIsMySpoon: That's how testing works :p

[2014-08-29 14:45:33] jimevans: so you don't need to compile the driver into your app
