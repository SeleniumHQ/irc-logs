[2014-04-01 04:39:07] addiks: hi, we use selenium with the magento-taf (phpunit). When each test runs seperate for its own, everything is fine. But when all tests run in the same process, i get the following error for two tests (always the third and ninth test): "sessionId d6181e0472a24724a1cb1663164e1a89 doesn't exist; perhaps this session was already stopped". The tests (and selenium and the browser/firefox) runs on a local debian stable server. Does anybody has any
[2014-04-01 04:39:07] addiks: help on how to fix these errors?

[2014-04-01 12:50:37] jimevans: what i strongly suspect is happening is that you have some kind of fixed element on the page (like an absolute header or footer), and the element you really want to click on can't be scrolled into view to be clicked because it's being obscured by another element. that, or it's contained in a div with an absolute minimum size with overflow hidden, and the resolution of your remote machine is less than that of your local machine, which won't let the elem
[2014-04-01 12:51:08] jimevans: and until i receive a sample page that disproves each of those theories, i'm going to go under that assumption.
