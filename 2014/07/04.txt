[2014-07-04 01:43:15] Timvde: Hi. I'm using the Selenium IDE for Firefox to create Selenium test cases. What does the "clickAndWait" feature (in Python: wait_for_page_to_load) wait for exactly?
[2014-07-04 01:45:13] Dave_B_: a good question!
[2014-07-04 01:45:15] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: dont use the ide
[2014-07-04 01:45:26] WhereIsMySpoon: Im sure I said this to someone yesterday too
[2014-07-04 01:45:26] Dave_B_: that is the best answer :)
[2014-07-04 01:45:55] Timvde: WhereIsMySpoon: Oh. So I should set up my tests manually? :(
[2014-07-04 01:46:00] Dave_B_: and when waiting for a page to load, you should pick what you need to be loaded & explicitly wait for that - generically telling if a pages has finished loading is very hard
[2014-07-04 01:47:14] Timvde: When doing it manually, waiting for <body> to load has been working until now
[2014-07-04 01:47:43] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: you should write your tests using webdriver in code
[2014-07-04 01:47:55] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: the IDE is outdated, legacy and buggy
[2014-07-04 01:48:06] Timvde: But setting up Selenium tests manually is a lot of work finding out all the IDs :(
[2014-07-04 01:48:16] WhereIsMySpoon: :|
[2014-07-04 01:48:20] WhereIsMySpoon: Not really
[2014-07-04 01:48:32] WhereIsMySpoon: But if you want sub-par tests that dont work reliably then you can do manual testing
[2014-07-04 01:48:41] WhereIsMySpoon: no need to invest effort into using the ide
[2014-07-04 01:48:45] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-07-04 01:48:53] Dave_B_: finding locators is pretty quick once you get used to it
[2014-07-04 01:48:57] Timvde: Go to browser > Inspect element > Copy id > go to IDE > paste ID
[2014-07-04 01:49:02] WhereIsMySpoon: the horror!
[2014-07-04 01:49:04] Timvde: All the time
[2014-07-04 01:49:10] rananda, quitting. (Ping timeout: 244 seconds)
[2014-07-04 01:49:10] WhereIsMySpoon: such clicks!
[2014-07-04 01:49:12] Dave_B_: well, once per element
[2014-07-04 01:49:14] WhereIsMySpoon: many effort!
[2014-07-04 01:49:20] Dave_B_: then you reuse it in code
[2014-07-04 01:49:21] Timvde: Compared to just interacting with the IDE/web browser and saving
[2014-07-04 01:49:36] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: nobody here is going to have sympathy for you if you arent willing to put in the effort to make good quality tests
[2014-07-04 01:49:39] Dave_B_: yes, but at the end your tests work and are maintainable
[2014-07-04 01:49:46] Timvde: But maybe it just looks annoying because the first thing I'm testing is a registration form :P
[2014-07-04 01:50:16] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: THE biggest advantage to automating tests is that they are much more reliable
[2014-07-04 01:50:29] Dave_B_: you can also make much more robust location strategies than auto-generated locaters often manage, so page changes cause less of a problem
[2014-07-04 01:50:37] WhereIsMySpoon: if you invalidate that by using something someone has said is not fit for purpose, you may as well not bother
[2014-07-04 01:50:54] Dave_B_: ok, if every element has an id anyway then it's not too bad as auto-generators tend to use that too, but that won't always be the case
[2014-07-04 01:50:57] WhereIsMySpoon: the IDE uses xpath a lot of the time, which is prone to breaking if your DOM changes
[2014-07-04 01:51:03] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: the IDE isnt that clever
[2014-07-04 01:51:10] WhereIsMySpoon: even if stuff has IDs it doesnt generally use them
[2014-07-04 01:51:14] Dave_B_: really? hah
[2014-07-04 01:51:17] Timvde: Dave_B_: The maintainability is actually what I'm afraid of by not having an automated way to create them.
[2014-07-04 01:51:18] Dave_B_: idiotic tool
[2014-07-04 01:51:41] Timvde: WhereIsMySpoon/Dave_B_: It seems to be using IDs all right...
[2014-07-04 01:51:51] WhereIsMySpoon: well you got lucky then
[2014-07-04 01:51:56] alko, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-04 01:51:59] Timvde: That's possible :)
[2014-07-04 01:52:08] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: nobody in here is going to help you use the IDE really
[2014-07-04 01:52:27] WhereIsMySpoon: get some simple code-based tests running and we'll start talking
[2014-07-04 01:52:45] WhereIsMySpoon: sorry if that seems harsh but it's just the reality
[2014-07-04 01:52:50] WhereIsMySpoon: it really should be added to the channel topic
[2014-07-04 01:53:01] Dave_B_: Timvde: If you build an object that looks like how the user views the page and then write your tests against that (page object model) then it becomes quite easy to maintain - page dom changes = update the model but no tests, behaviour changes then update tests, and lots of tests hitting one page all share the same understanding of the page rather than each having a generated view of it
[2014-07-04 01:53:04] Timvde: WhereIsMySpoon: But the thing is, live browser test cases are prone to change flow. If you can just record the new flow in some way, that's awesome. If you have to manually retype it every time, that's a lot of overhead.
[2014-07-04 01:53:27] Timvde: WhereIsMySpoon: Btw, I was exporting and manually checking the generated code to Python
[2014-07-04 01:53:35] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: but you dont need to "manually retype it every time" if you set up well-documented, well-formed tests
[2014-07-04 01:53:36] Dave_B_: also, you can iron out the weird bugs with race conditions etc which with generated tests will jsut cause 'random' failures forever
[2014-07-04 01:54:06] WhereIsMySpoon: Timvde: much like you dont need to rewrite code every time for tiny little changes if you write good code for an application
[2014-07-04 01:54:14] Timvde: Dave_B_: That sounds like an interesting approach :)
[2014-07-04 01:54:56] Dave_B_: it's nice, just don't go crazy with turning every little thing into an object…. lazy implementations are the best I feel ;)
[2014-07-04 01:55:17] Dave_B_: the first test that uses a certain page is a bit of a pain, but after that the other tests take moments
[2014-07-04 01:55:43] Dave_B_: also, you can share common bits like maybe navigation elements between all your pages easily

[2014-07-04 01:56:43] Timvde: Btw, sorry if it looked like I was trying to be lazy by using the IDE, I'm just looking for the easiest way to maintain tests. If I need a bigger initial effort for that, it's fine for me :)

[2014-07-04 01:57:10] Dave_B_: aye, it's cool, maintenance is a massive issue faced by browser automation
[2014-07-04 01:57:37] Dave_B_: we all try different stuff to see if it works, so most of us have learned the hard way what dsoes and doesn't work
[2014-07-04 01:57:39] Timvde: Although the idea of the IDE still looks pretty cool in my head, it's a pity it's not developed anymore
[2014-07-04 01:58:21] WhereIsMySpoon: its a nice idea in principle

[2014-07-04 01:59:11] Dave_B_: (an example of where generated tests can go wrong: imagine you have a 'home' button on every page. Now it's locator gets changed. Every generated test that uses it would need regenerated. While in a page object model approach you change the locator in one place once and all is well again)
[2014-07-04 01:59:26] WhereIsMySpoon: Zeukkari: :)
[2014-07-04 01:59:56] Timvde: Dave_B_: Well, I extracted the tests to Python, so I could use sed to change all locators :P
[2014-07-04 02:00:07] WhereIsMySpoon: !
[2014-07-04 02:00:10] Timvde: But that's of course error prone :P
[2014-07-04 02:00:22] WhereIsMySpoon: very
[2014-07-04 02:00:23] Timvde: Will "probably" work in "most" of the cases
[2014-07-04 02:00:25] Timvde: That sort of stuff
[2014-07-04 02:00:34] Dave_B_: indeed :)
[2014-07-04 02:00:45] wilhelm: Sounds like you want page objects.
[2014-07-04 02:00:52] WhereIsMySpoon: wilhelm: that's what we've been saying :)
[2014-07-04 02:00:53] Timvde: Anyway, the page object view looks like a great idea
[2014-07-04 02:01:04] Dave_B_: IDE is like that - probably mostly works, but then people think tests are just inherantly flakey which is not the case at all

[2014-07-04 02:01:48] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: no worries :)
[2014-07-04 02:01:55] Timvde: Wow, I thought this was just an idea of yours. But there actually is a general implementation of it :o

[2014-07-04 06:14:12] Neo--: hey guys
[2014-07-04 06:14:33] Neo--: why does chrome driver on windows only allow local connections?
[2014-07-04 06:14:37] Neo--: and how do I enable it for remote?
[2014-07-04 06:15:25] p_l: Neo--: the drivers in general only accept local connections, afaik.
[2014-07-04 06:15:36] p_l: I used to run an instance of selenium server
[2014-07-04 06:15:49] p_l: which also took care of starting and stopping browser instances
[2014-07-04 06:15:56] Neo--: erm, I regularly connect from my VM to my host machine via remotely accessible IPs?
[2014-07-04 06:16:14] Neo--: host machine is running chromedriver
[2014-07-04 06:16:26] Neo--: though host is osx
[2014-07-04 06:16:35] AutomatedTester: Neo--: its a security feature
[2014-07-04 06:16:36] Neo--: and ATM i'm trying to configure it on windows
[2014-07-04 06:16:48] Neo--: AutomatedTester, is there a way to disable it?
[2014-07-04 06:16:53] p_l: Neo--: setup the drivers you need, then run Selenium Server (it's available as single jar, or at least was), and point to Selenium Server's port + specify which browser you want in code
[2014-07-04 06:16:57] AutomatedTester: yes, use the Java Server
[2014-07-04 06:17:28] p_l: Neo--: this will also take care of things like starting Chrome/chromedriver whenever you start a test
[2014-07-04 06:17:39] AutomatedTester: Neo--: we recommend that servers provided by vendors only allow connections from localhost in the spec for security reasons
[2014-07-04 06:18:02] AutomatedTester: Neo--: adding more layers of in direction that must be manually started keep people somewhat safe

[2014-07-04 06:32:27] WhereIsMySpoon: I wouldnt want to do that full time either
[2014-07-04 06:32:34] WhereIsMySpoon: its ok but being a dev is much better

[2014-07-04 06:33:34] p_l: at least when it came to testing web applications, it sucks

[2014-07-04 06:33:54] p_l: expensive as fuck, useless for Web Testing
[2014-07-04 06:34:06] p_l: hilariously shitty when it comes to Web, even
[2014-07-04 06:34:14] Neo--: really?
[2014-07-04 06:34:16] p_l: really
[2014-07-04 06:34:18] Neo--: we considered it with perfecto
[2014-07-04 06:34:25] Neo--: but went with selenium implementation
[2014-07-04 06:34:40] plushwork: WhereIsMySpoon: devs usually do unit testing not integration testing
[2014-07-04 06:34:41] p_l: Arguably, it might be good for native win32 apps, or TN3270 stuff, Telnet etc.
[2014-07-04 06:34:54] p_l: plushwork: depends on stuff being worked on
[2014-07-04 06:35:05] WhereIsMySpoon: plushwork: depends how big the company is :)
[2014-07-04 06:35:13] p_l: that too
[2014-07-04 06:35:38] plushwork: WhereIsMySpoon: integration tests are too expensive to have devs do them imho
[2014-07-04 06:35:50] WhereIsMySpoon: I see
[2014-07-04 06:35:56] WhereIsMySpoon: Well I do both here
[2014-07-04 06:36:07] WhereIsMySpoon: as part of dev
[2014-07-04 06:36:08] p_l: plushwork: not necessarily... make them well automated, "distributed", and it might work
[2014-07-04 06:36:35] p_l: though dedicated QA team would still be useful even with devs writing all kinds of tests
[2014-07-04 06:36:47] Dave_B_: if things need int tests written for them i'll get devs to help out as needed here - integration is too important to not do just cause it's hard/slow :p

[2014-07-04 09:18:26] nirvdrum: Nah.
[2014-07-04 09:18:38] nirvdrum: I hold a minority opinion on most of this stuff.
[2014-07-04 09:18:59] nirvdrum: I'll leave it at I've done an awful lot of testing for a lot of different sites, and IEDriver is hands down the most reliable.
[2014-07-04 09:23:24] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: really? I've literally just started to run my tests on IE, and I cant run my first test because of the flickering issue with hover
[2014-07-04 09:23:53] nirvdrum: I guess I do a different type of testing.
[2014-07-04 09:24:04] nirvdrum: But ChromeDriver crashes all the time.
[2014-07-04 09:24:09] WhereIsMySpoon: o.o
[2014-07-04 09:24:13] WhereIsMySpoon: ive never had chromedriver crash
[2014-07-04 09:24:21] WhereIsMySpoon: and thats what I started my dev with (and still use)
[2014-07-04 09:24:23] nirvdrum: Lucky you.
[2014-07-04 09:24:33] nirvdrum: ChromeDriver is the least reliable driver from my experience.
[2014-07-04 09:25:06] nirvdrum: And it shits all over the filesystem and refuses to clean up after itself.  So I had to add a sweeper process to clean that up.
[2014-07-04 09:25:13] nirvdrum: I filled up a few hard drives figuring that one out.
[2014-07-04 09:25:17] WhereIsMySpoon: O.o
[2014-07-04 09:25:38] nirvdrum: And then there's the fun game of matching up the self-updating version of Chrome with the version of ChromeDriver that'll actually work with it.
[2014-07-04 09:25:47] nirvdrum: And just pray that ChromeDriver didn't introduce a new regression.
[2014-07-04 09:25:57] WhereIsMySpoon: well thats the same with firefox driver too
[2014-07-04 09:26:06] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt with IE purely because it isnt updated that often
[2014-07-04 09:26:30] nirvdrum: Well, the Firefox driver is included in Selenium.
[2014-07-04 09:26:42] WhereIsMySpoon: doesnt mean its any less likely to have bugs
[2014-07-04 09:26:45] JamesPrescott, quitting. (Quit: Logging off)
[2014-07-04 09:26:47] nirvdrum: But it's not a problem with IE because MS actually does a remarkable job of supporting published APIs.
[2014-07-04 09:27:13] nirvdrum: No, they're not guaranteed to.  But FirefoxDriver has a lot fewer bugs.
[2014-07-04 09:27:57] WhereIsMySpoon: that'd be why the VS c++ compiler is always way behind the other ones then?
[2014-07-04 09:27:59] nirvdrum: I have a plugin that works on IE 6 -> IE 11.  The browser has changed substantially in that time.  But the API still works.
[2014-07-04 09:28:02] WhereIsMySpoon: because of the remarkable job
[2014-07-04 09:28:07] nirvdrum: Software engineering 101 stuff there.  It's amazing.
[2014-07-04 09:28:08] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-07-04 09:28:25] WhereIsMySpoon: and implements stuff differently
[2014-07-04 09:28:32] nirvdrum: You've a) just changed the discussion, and b) it no longer has anything to do with their published APIs.
[2014-07-04 09:28:45] nirvdrum: But if you want to engage in general MS bashing, have at it.
[2014-07-04 09:28:55] WhereIsMySpoon: heh, sorry
[2014-07-04 09:29:06] WhereIsMySpoon: but I just always have issues with IE and its non compatibility with specs
[2014-07-04 09:29:16] WhereIsMySpoon: it does a lot of things differently to the other browsers
[2014-07-04 09:29:19] WhereIsMySpoon: usually owrse
[2014-07-04 09:29:20] WhereIsMySpoon: worse*
[2014-07-04 09:29:41] WhereIsMySpoon: especially with CSS and JS dom manipulation
[2014-07-04 09:30:04] nirvdrum: Chrome really seems like the outlier on a lot of this stuff.
[2014-07-04 09:30:35] nirvdrum: Obviously IE 8 and such are bad. But modern IE are pretty good at sticking to the specs.
[2014-07-04 09:30:35] WhereIsMySpoon: if you take a look at how closely browser follow the specs, chrome is usually the leader :)
[2014-07-04 09:30:50] WhereIsMySpoon: IE is still behind on html5
[2014-07-04 09:30:55] nirvdrum: Chrome is doing exactly what MS was vilified for.
[2014-07-04 09:31:18] nirvdrum: They're not waiting for the standards body, shipping the browser, forcing others to play catch up and now the de facto spec becomes the real spec.
[2014-07-04 09:31:28] WhereIsMySpoon: except it's doing it and it's working
[2014-07-04 09:31:30] nirvdrum: HTML 5 isn't even really a spec anymore.  And it's still in draft.
[2014-07-04 09:31:39] WhereIsMySpoon: instead of trying to do it and it being different from what is documented
[2014-07-04 09:31:44] nirvdrum: Except your argument was not adhering to the spec . . .
[2014-07-04 09:32:04] nirvdrum: This is a silly discussion.  I knew I shouldn't have gotten drawn into it.
[2014-07-04 09:32:10] nirvdrum: You're right.  Google is awesome and Microsoft sucks.
[2014-07-04 09:32:21] WhereIsMySpoon: you know I never said anything about google or microsoft
[2014-07-04 09:32:27] WhereIsMySpoon: just about IE and chrome
[2014-07-04 09:32:52] WhereIsMySpoon: with an accidental detour to c++ which wasnt really relevant
[2014-07-04 09:33:06] WhereIsMySpoon: but go ahead :)
[2014-07-04 09:33:08] nirvdrum: Okay.  IE sucks and Chrome is awesome.

[2014-07-04 09:33:46] WhereIsMySpoon: I find that difficult to say anything to except to agree
[2014-07-04 09:34:02] nirvdrum: Of course.  I just gave you the answer you wanted :-)
[2014-07-04 09:34:16] WhereIsMySpoon: except you're trying to be condescending
[2014-07-04 09:34:23] WhereIsMySpoon: and make me out to be a fanboy
[2014-07-04 09:34:25] nirvdrum: No.
[2014-07-04 09:34:54] nirvdrum: I'm trying to say you've formulated your opinion and seemingly have no interest in changing it.  On two separate points you changed what you were saying.
[2014-07-04 09:35:16] WhereIsMySpoon: nirvdrum: from my experience with using both, I'm afraid that there is no way I can change my opinion
[2014-07-04 09:35:31] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe we've both just been lucky/unlucky from that perspective
[2014-07-04 09:36:00] nirvdrum: WhereIsMySpoon: That's fine.  But that has nothing to do with adherence to standards.  Or published APIs.  Or stability of the web driver implementation.
[2014-07-04 09:36:43] WhereIsMySpoon: well it does, considering that I expect certain things to work in certain ways put down by standards, and with regards to my experience with other browsers using webdriver
[2014-07-04 09:36:51] nirvdrum: If you like Chrome the best, there's nothing wrong with that.  You're certainly not alone.  I'm a Firefox fan myself.  I absolutely hate what they've done to APIs though.
[2014-07-04 09:37:52] WhereIsMySpoon: my experience with IE in webdriver is even echoed by jim
[2014-07-04 09:37:55] WhereIsMySpoon: http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/revisiting-native-events-in-ie-driver.html
[2014-07-04 09:37:57] WhereIsMySpoon: :)
[2014-07-04 09:37:58] nirvdrum: Are you talking about published standards or draft standards.  The latter not really being standard yet :-P
[2014-07-04 09:42:37] nirvdrum: FYI: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=494

[2014-07-04 09:43:08] nirvdrum: If you don't do a ton of tests or have a massive hard drive, you probably won't even notice.  But it happens, unfortunately.
[2014-07-04 09:45:03] WhereIsMySpoon: i have 0 folders named "scoped_dir"
[2014-07-04 09:45:14] WhereIsMySpoon: i usually use chromedriver
[2014-07-04 09:46:10] WhereIsMySpoon: but there are plenty of issues for all browsers, its just that its very frustrating that in the very first test I try out on IE, its just completely broken
[2014-07-04 09:46:18] WhereIsMySpoon: it just reinforces my opinion

[2014-07-04 23:38:43] wlp|tab: Any one in?
[2014-07-04 23:40:46] wlp|tab: Those of us working with Pale Moon (a Firefox fork) have a problem.  Starting with the next major version of PM, Version 25 (PM versions will no longer match FF versions), PM will no longer share any browser code with FF.
[2014-07-04 23:41:39] wlp|tab: So it might be a good idea if you were to copy the FirefoxDriver to a Pale Moon specific class in case Mozilla changes the stuff inside FF relevant to WebDriver.

[2014-07-04 23:43:05] wlp|tab: Basically, for the time being, as long as that class remains compatible with FF 24.* ESR, you shouldn't have a problem.
