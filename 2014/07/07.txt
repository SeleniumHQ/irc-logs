[2014-07-07 00:09:04] Timvde: Not a real Selenium question, but being new to this: when using the page object model to test a registration process that takes multiple steps, would it be a good idea to create just one object, or should I use an object per page?
[2014-07-07 00:09:35] AndreiH, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 00:09:50] Timvde: It looks like the first one would be simpler for further testing (the other still being tied to the registration steps), but a lot harder and messier to code
[2014-07-07 00:11:16] Timvde: Because you would have to make it find the IDs on the different pages itself and fill in "as much as possible" on each page

[2014-07-07 02:02:28] defuex: hi all, what would be a good way of testing with multiple browsers. the way im testing in multiple browsers now is, that i wrote a class which has methods implemented with each browser type and which are returning a WebDriver object. i guess that is not a good way to use if many test cases are used because of calling this class everytime for each browser when testing. someone got an idea?

[2014-07-07 09:24:50] dude-x: well in that case
[2014-07-07 09:25:05] dude-x: the first thing is you want to use the page object model
[2014-07-07 09:25:24] dude-x: instead of writing tests that direclty interface with webdriver, your tests will only use the page objects themselves
[2014-07-07 09:25:26] edoloughlin2, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 09:25:35] ShadowXOR: I know some Python and PowerShell, I do manual testing for a living and am getting started with automation.  I've been reading up heavily on the page object model but it hasn't really clicked.  I get the idea but not really how to structure my code and files.
[2014-07-07 09:25:42] dude-x: the page object code will have code that interacts with webdriver
[2014-07-07 09:26:03] ShadowXOR: It seems kind of like an MVC type thing (of which I'm only vaguely familiar with as well) where you separate the logic from the UI, but instead your separating the variables and tests from the logic.
[2014-07-07 09:26:29] dude-x: well the variables of the test are in the test; but the logic that interacts with the page is in the page object
[2014-07-07 09:26:46] ShadowXOR: So for every page I should have two files, the page object with the logic, and the test with the variables and asserts?
[2014-07-07 09:27:05] dude-x: well, for every interactable part of the website, it will have its own page object
[2014-07-07 09:27:10] *WhereIsMySpoon hasnt made his tests with page objects at all'
[2014-07-07 09:27:15] dude-x: your tests will use one or many page objects
[2014-07-07 09:27:21] ShadowXOR: And each page object is a *.py file?
[2014-07-07 09:27:26] dude-x: yes
[2014-07-07 09:27:48] ShadowXOR: How should I split up my tests into *.py files if each page object requires its own file?
[2014-07-07 09:27:51] dude-x: for example, if you have to log in, that will be the login_page.py; and it will have class LoginPage(object)
[2014-07-07 09:28:01] dude-x: well this is python, you can have many classes in one file
[2014-07-07 09:28:10] dude-x: but logically it makes it easier to have each page in it's own file
[2014-07-07 09:28:28] ShadowXOR: So really I only need two file types, page objects, and tests.  Nothing else?  And I can get going?
[2014-07-07 09:28:35] dude-x: sometimes you may have complicated widgets that are used in multiple pages, that can be it's own file too

[2014-07-07 09:29:06] hirani, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 09:29:11] dude-x: hmm
[2014-07-07 09:29:36] dude-x: it can be as simple as a pagination thing (it has 4 buttons, and a box to enter the page number); multiple pages may use this
[2014-07-07 09:29:40] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: say you have an image upload functionality
[2014-07-07 09:29:44] WhereIsMySpoon: that is used acros smultuple pages
[2014-07-07 09:29:45] dude-x: and the code is always the same
[2014-07-07 09:29:51] WhereIsMySpoon: that would merit its own page object file
[2014-07-07 09:30:05] WhereIsMySpoon: and you wouldnt put it in each page its on
[2014-07-07 09:30:10] WhereIsMySpoon: as that would duplicate code
[2014-07-07 09:30:38] wdj, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2014-07-07 09:30:40] dude-x: a basic setup is to have a folder for pages, and a folder for tests; and maybe a folder for resources like files you want to upload or download
[2014-07-07 09:30:47] dborin: ShadowXOR: don't let the name confuse you..."page" doesn't have to be the whole page...it can be one thing on a page, like login
[2014-07-07 09:31:23] dborin: ShadowXOR: you write a class/method(s) for logging in, and then your tests use this class/method over and over again to log in
[2014-07-07 09:31:45] ShadowXOR: OK this definitely helps, thanks.  I'll see what I can get going with this information then will ask more as I inevitably crash into walls. :)
[2014-07-07 09:31:54] dborin: ShadowXOR: if the login page changes, you only have to change one class/method (*.py file) instead of changing 20 different places in your code
[2014-07-07 09:32:10] dude-x: for my test framework, i have a wrapper to the webdriver library; it does all the waiting for me if I want to find an element, it also has convenience methods to wait for events like visiblity, invisiblity, element removal, and so on.
[2014-07-07 09:32:25] jimevans, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-07 09:32:41] dborin: dude-x: is that really a framework?  Or is more base object modeling?
[2014-07-07 09:32:52] WhereIsMySpoon: depends how fancy a title you want
[2014-07-07 09:32:52] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-07-07 09:33:00] ShadowXOR: I definitely see the benefits of the model just trying to align my brain since I'm still relatively new to writing classes and such I'm trying to find the structure of it, most articles just cover the theory.
[2014-07-07 09:33:05] dborin: s/Or is more/Or is that more a/
[2014-07-07 09:33:34] dude-x: well i call it a framework, in the sense you have to use the wrapper always, and i take care of a lot of things for you using py.test
[2014-07-07 09:33:50] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: try it out and you'll get the hang of it :) programming is pretty much always better to try stuff out than to spend hours reading u on stuff
[2014-07-07 09:33:51] WhereIsMySpoon: up*
[2014-07-07 09:33:57] dborin: ShadowXOR: you don't even have to write a whole class...you can have a page of methods that act as a utility file...
[2014-07-07 09:33:58] WhereIsMySpoon: in my experience anyway
[2014-07-07 09:34:12] dborin: ShadowXOR: you're abstracting away basic repeating functionality

[2014-07-07 09:34:23] WhereIsMySpoon: is pretty handy
[2014-07-07 09:34:24] ShadowXOR: Yeah, I think you're right.  But it's hard sitting there with the blinking cursor having no clue what to do! :) But yeah, I really need to just roll up my sleeves.
[2014-07-07 09:34:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: hehe we all know that feeling
[2014-07-07 09:34:40] WhereIsMySpoon: the start is always hardest
[2014-07-07 09:34:50] dborin: ShadowXOR: don't try to boil the ocean
[2014-07-07 09:34:51] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: if you have issues starting, write out a defined plan of waht you want to achieve
[2014-07-07 09:34:56] ShadowXOR: I made a nice PowerShell utility a week or so ago that boosted my confidence, this is a much larger task (so far).
[2014-07-07 09:34:57] dude-x: i have a BasePage object that has a whole bunch of utility functions like creating a timestamp, date handling and so on.

[2014-07-07 09:35:17] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: start out by say, automating a login
[2014-07-07 09:35:21] ShadowXOR: I'm going to start with just automating our login screen.
[2014-07-07 09:35:26] dborin: WhereIsMySpoon: first!
[2014-07-07 09:35:28] WhereIsMySpoon: :D
[2014-07-07 09:35:30] ShadowXOR: Yeah, I got it working with unittest now I want to try it with py.test.

[2014-07-07 09:35:58] WhereIsMySpoon: ShadowXOR: then by testing the core simple functionality of your site
[2014-07-07 09:36:01] dborin: a BDD framework (behave works really well for python)
[2014-07-07 09:36:02] WhereIsMySpoon: one by one
[2014-07-07 09:36:11] dborin: is easy for anyone to read the success or failure output
[2014-07-07 09:36:20] dborin: especially when you put it into a CI like Jenkins
[2014-07-07 09:36:35] ShadowXOR: I looked at the Behave documentation, seemed heavily tied in with SpecFlow, etc.  Found it a bit confusing but will give it a look.
[2014-07-07 09:36:42] dude-x: dborin: that's why my test harness forces users to write descriptions for the locators so that you can see "The Button that blows things up was not found" rather than "No Element found with class .chzn-single.zgdfsgdf
[2014-07-07 09:36:55] ShadowXOR: We have Jenkins CI but getting my developers to cooperate with anything I'm doing is a different story.

[2014-07-07 09:37:55] WhereIsMySpoon: fortunately, I am a dev and we do our own testing
[2014-07-07 09:37:59] WhereIsMySpoon: so I can make changes myself :D
[2014-07-07 09:38:02] dborin: ShadowXOR: Hell, BDD is easy cuz even if they don't know Python, anyone can learn gherkin syntax, then you write the underlying methods that fulfill the If/when/then
[2014-07-07 09:38:20] ShadowXOR: They already do TDD, and I'm trying to automate, where does BDD fit in?
[2014-07-07 09:38:24] dude-x: WhereIsMySpoon: if you're writing the UI/backend code, you can make testing easier, such as using ids, well structured divs, and so on for selenium testing
[2014-07-07 09:38:47] WhereIsMySpoon: dude-x: and I have already improved that myself a lot :)
[2014-07-07 09:39:01] WhereIsMySpoon: I had to do that before I started writing selenium tests for our products :)
[2014-07-07 09:39:03] dude-x: also adding test hooks like skipping authentication, or preloading state via database updates or cookie settings
[2014-07-07 09:39:06] dborin: ShadowXOR: TDD includes BDD...TDD also includes writing low level unit tests and small, low level integration tests
[2014-07-07 09:39:27] ShadowXOR: So BDD is more on the development side then?
[2014-07-07 09:39:30] ShadowXOR: I'm QA.
[2014-07-07 09:39:46] dude-x: BDD makes sense if you have non technical users contributing tests
[2014-07-07 09:39:50] dude-x: otherwise, it's 2x more work
[2014-07-07 09:40:06] ShadowXOR: The people we have writing tests are all technical, and a small team.
[2014-07-07 09:40:14] dude-x: then write pure python code
[2014-07-07 09:40:20] ShadowXOR: Got it.
[2014-07-07 09:40:22] dborin: dude-x: I disagree...BDD allows managers and execs to see the output of tests and understand what is covered and what is happening
[2014-07-07 09:40:36] ShadowXOR: We don't really have any of them involved, at least at our company.
[2014-07-07 09:40:40] dude-x: dborin: well that goes with what i'm saying, non technical users who get to have input
[2014-07-07 09:40:41] ShadowXOR: That's the last thing we need. :)
[2014-07-07 09:41:12] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 09:41:22] dborin: BDD also encourages writing smaller test modules and then putting them together into larger test suites
[2014-07-07 09:41:28] dborin: test sweets
[2014-07-07 09:41:35] dborin: mmmmm......sweets.....
[2014-07-07 09:42:06] dborin: ShadowXOR: you're small now, but if you write with scale in mind, when it comes time to scale, you will have already done the ground work

[2014-07-07 09:43:14] dborin: ShadowXOR: before you know it, you suddenly have 100 tests in 8 test sweets, and suddenly you need to run in parallel and suddenly you have managers an execs who start asking "Hey, what is being tested" and now you have to waste time writing reports and/or matrices explaining what your tests do
[2014-07-07 09:43:38] richdownie, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 09:43:40] ShadowXOR: So what are the naming conventions for page objects and tests?  Also I don't fully grasp what a test suite or test harness fits in?
[2014-07-07 09:43:45] dborin: ShadowXOR: If you start out with small test modules written using BDD, yeah there's a bit more learning curve, but down the road, you just point to the end results of the test runs and say "read for yourself"
[2014-07-07 09:43:53] WhereIsMySpoon: this is why having plans laid out of what the tests should do are helpful :)

[2014-07-07 10:42:09] ShadowXOR: sorry....i said that wrong
[2014-07-07 10:42:15] dude-x: so it may start with class LoginPage: username_field = By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'input#username'
[2014-07-07 10:42:26] ShadowXOR: I meant like I have driver.get(URL)  so do I put that URL in the page object?

[2014-07-07 10:43:58] ShadowXOR: :|
[2014-07-07 10:44:46] ShadowXOR: So...where am I putting the URL?  In the page object or in the test.
[2014-07-07 10:45:10] jibran__, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 10:45:16] dude-x: always in the page object
[2014-07-07 10:45:23] dude-x: imagine this, you have 100 tests that log in
[2014-07-07 10:45:35] dude-x: the page object is the one true source of info; the login page URL can change
[2014-07-07 10:45:39] dude-x: but that's only place to change it
[2014-07-07 10:45:59] dude-x: if the URL is in the test, that's 100 tests you have to change
[2014-07-07 10:46:18] ShadowXOR: What about the login credentials?
[2014-07-07 10:46:37] ShadowXOR: I imagine different tests may need different credentials based on what you're testing, but 99% of the time I'll want to use the same one, how should I approach that?
[2014-07-07 10:47:06] dude-x: store credentials in a separate file
[2014-07-07 10:47:49] dogarrhea, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 10:47:50] dude-x: in a advanced shop, credentials are just a template, where the security server will auto fill the secret stuff
[2014-07-07 10:47:59] dogarrhea: the decision to make hidden input fields un-interact-able with is very very moronic

[2014-07-07 10:48:49] dogarrhea, quitting. (Client Quit)
[2014-07-07 10:48:50] dborin: ShadowXOR: you can also use a local config file to read in things like login creds, or set env vars in your shell and set them in your code...this is useful because then you can run your tests in different environments with different test users
[2014-07-07 10:49:09] dude-x: yeah environment variables are another tool
[2014-07-07 10:49:28] ShadowXOR: But how would I point to a different variable depending on what test is being run?
[2014-07-07 10:49:55] dude-x: at the simplest level, you can have a credentials.py
[2014-07-07 10:50:11] dborin: ShadowXOR: no, you'd probably use the same creds most times...different creds when you finally put them on a CI like Jenkins (so you don't interfere with your automation)
[2014-07-07 10:50:25] dborin: but you don't have to rewrite tests...just set a different user
[2014-07-07 10:50:32] ShadowXOR: Well for my test I'll need to test varying permissions levels, ideally via different logins.
[2014-07-07 10:50:51] dborin: export MY_TEST_USER=generic_user1
[2014-07-07 10:50:57] dborin: export MY_TEST_USER=admin_user1
[2014-07-07 10:51:05] dborin: now you can run with different user creds
[2014-07-07 10:51:06] dude-x: make a class called User: class User(object): def __init__(self, username,password): self.username =usernmame; self.password = password;   main_test_user = User('Joe', 'opensame')
[2014-07-07 10:51:10] dborin: but you don't have to write new tests
[2014-07-07 10:51:17] ShadowXOR: I've never seen export, not quite sure where that fits in.
[2014-07-07 10:51:27] dude-x: export is a Bash shell command
[2014-07-07 10:51:29] dborin: unix shell
[2014-07-07 10:51:42] dborin: oh no..you're using windoze...my condolences
[2014-07-07 10:51:45] ShadowXOR: So how do I pass a specific user to my page object?
[2014-07-07 10:52:02] ShadowXOR: I'm an ex-Mac current Windows man.
[2014-07-07 10:52:03] dborin: ShadowXOR: just create a yaml or json config page
[2014-07-07 10:52:11] dborin: and read it it in
[2014-07-07 10:52:18] dborin: and set the vars in your init
[2014-07-07 10:52:31] dborin: google for python yaml or python json
[2014-07-07 10:52:34] dude-x: unless you're automating login page; the login page should have functions that login as the main test user; the module will import the credentials module
[2014-07-07 10:52:37] dborin: you'll find lots of stuff
[2014-07-07 10:52:50] ShadowXOR: Well I can see I'm in way over my head when almost every new term I've only heard of or have basic understanding of.  Back to the drawing board. :(
[2014-07-07 10:52:52] dude-x: you can  use json. yaml, or even native python
[2014-07-07 10:53:35] ShadowXOR: Should I just hard code this first then come back and make it more extensible?
[2014-07-07 10:55:00] dude-x: ShadowXOR: you can do something like this user ={'password': 'opensesame', 'username': 'Joe'}
[2014-07-07 10:55:13] jibran_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 10:55:17] dude-x: have your function just access the dictionary
[2014-07-07 10:55:35] ShadowXOR: So what's the deal between single quotes and double quotes for string in Python?  They seem the same.
[2014-07-07 10:56:15] dude-x: no difference; it's a conveinence if you have to use quotes. "Don't do this" versus 'Don\t do this"
[2014-07-07 10:56:28] *dude-x forgot the quote in my example'
[2014-07-07 10:57:02] ShadowXOR: So using escape characters versus not.
[2014-07-07 10:57:06] dude-x: 'Don\'t do this'; if you know you have a quote use double quotes to avoid escaping single quotes
[2014-07-07 10:57:23] dude-x: pretty much
[2014-07-07 10:57:34] dude-x: just be consistent though
[2014-07-07 10:57:41] dude-x: so it's easy on the eyes
[2014-07-07 10:57:52] ShadowXOR: So it looks like if my code runs without issue, even without an assert or verify it says one test passed, so I don't need to use those if the test just needs to run without errors?
[2014-07-07 10:58:01] dude-x: you will want an assert

[2014-07-07 10:58:16] dude-x: otherwise it may seem to pass but there's stuff missing
[2014-07-07 10:58:29] dude-x: but yes, it will throw an exception if something is wrong, like the element is missing, or stale
[2014-07-07 10:58:31] dude-x: or not visible
[2014-07-07 10:58:34] ShadowXOR: OK
[2014-07-07 10:58:54] ShadowXOR: So I assume in my test files they should look something like this?
[2014-07-07 10:59:39] ShadowXOR: import login_page login_page.TestLogin.setup
[2014-07-07 10:59:46] ShadowXOR: login_page being the page object?
[2014-07-07 11:00:25] dude-x: in the simplest case, your page object should have an __init__ that will take a driver object
[2014-07-07 11:00:42] ShadowXOR: What...all the examples (and people said) I don't need an __init__
[2014-07-07 11:00:54] ShadowXOR: I've been using that in my courses for creating classes but was told those weren't necessary for tests.
[2014-07-07 11:01:01] bimmelino, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-07 11:01:20] dude-x: so in your test, it should 1) from login_page import LoginPage 2) initlaize the page: login_page = LoginPage(driver)
[2014-07-07 11:01:43] dude-x: you don't need __init__ for the test themselves, page objects should be treated as traditional classes in Object Oriented Programming
[2014-07-07 11:03:52] dude-x: you can skip the initializng page object to get started; just have it use selenium directly
[2014-07-07 11:04:07] dude-x: but the 'proper' way is to have it accept a live driver object
[2014-07-07 11:05:16] ShadowXOR: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[2014-07-07 11:06:40] ddary, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 11:08:28] dude-x: it may seem like a lot of trouble; but it's the kind of trouble that will scale
[2014-07-07 11:08:29] ShadowXOR: I assume I should have this all source controlled (adding even more complexity)? :|
[2014-07-07 11:09:38] dude-x: yeah sure
[2014-07-07 11:09:46] dude-x: learn git or something
[2014-07-07 11:10:06] ShadowXOR: So to allow a test file to insert its own credentials into my login class, I assume I have to make it a paramater of the class?  Is there any other way to do it.
[2014-07-07 11:11:20] dude-x: in my code i have from credentials import main_user; login_page.log_in_as(main_user); the class expects a user object that will have a username and password attribute
[2014-07-07 11:11:43] ShadowXOR: And where should I create the user objects, in some generic utility file?
[2014-07-07 11:11:45] jimpurbrick, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-07-07 11:11:51] dude-x: i have a credentials.py
[2014-07-07 11:11:55] dude-x: you can use the same name!
[2014-07-07 11:12:08] ShadowXOR: Will be confusing for me to figure out how to link those all together but that sounds like the best approach.
[2014-07-07 11:12:19] dude-x: well the import system is how you link together files
[2014-07-07 11:12:29] dude-x: so study python imports if you need help
[2014-07-07 11:12:46] ShadowXOR: that's not that hard, but do import in the test, or the page object
[2014-07-07 11:12:54] ShadowXOR: i assume whichever is being run
[2014-07-07 11:13:01] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 759
[2014-07-07 11:13:09] dude-x: you basically import the files you need to make a module work
[2014-07-07 11:13:21] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 11:13:22] dude-x: however with test files, you follow the convention of the test runner
[2014-07-07 11:14:28] ShadowXOR: so your credentials.py you have a user class, then you instantiate a bunch of different users?
[2014-07-07 11:14:33] dude-x: yup
[2014-07-07 11:15:11] dude-x: a simplter thing might be to have a whole bunch of users defined as dictionaries, but a class lets me write stuff without quotes; i like saving a few keystrokes
[2014-07-07 11:16:04] ShadowXOR: so i don't really need to use __init__ for tests, do I need it for the users/credentials?
[2014-07-07 11:16:15] dude-x: nope, it should be just be a "list" of users
[2014-07-07 11:16:38] dude-x: user_a = (...) user_b =(...)
[2014-07-07 11:16:53] dude-x: no need to make it complicated
[2014-07-07 11:18:12] ShadowXOR: I find the Python documentation has bad examples.

[2014-07-07 11:25:58] dude-x: it may be 'obtuse' but the nice thing about python
[2014-07-07 11:26:03] dude-x: is that you can open the interpreter and play around
[2014-07-07 11:26:15] dude-x: so you can experiment and learn by doing
[2014-07-07 11:26:21] dude-x: i still do that every now and then
[2014-07-07 11:26:49] ShadowXOR: So right now I have users.py with my class and a sample user, my test_login.py (currently blank) for my test, then my login_page.py with the logic filled out except I don't know how to accept whatever user test_login.py wants.
[2014-07-07 11:26:59] ShadowXOR: I'm definitely doing lots of experimenting.
[2014-07-07 11:27:18] dude-x: you're on the right track :)
[2014-07-07 11:31:17] ShadowXOR: When you write your tests, do you manually create an instance of the page object class, then set it up, then run the test, then cleanup, all while declaring the functions and passing the appropriate variables?
[2014-07-07 11:35:57] ShadowXOR: I'm not sure where to import either...in the page object or in the test.

[2014-07-07 14:31:44] andeesoft: how do you make it a global? in the base class create public WebDriver driver; Will the classes that inherite the base class be able to just call driver.etc?

[2014-07-07 15:11:15] dude-x: login_page has test related stuff
[2014-07-07 15:11:17] dude-x: it should not
[2014-07-07 15:11:24] dude-x: that belongs in test_login_page.py
[2014-07-07 15:11:54] ShadowXOR: So in login_page should I declare things like enter name, enter password, or login, but then on the test page I have the user_can_login?

[2014-07-07 15:26:45] dude-x: that's wrong if you put it in the top of the class
[2014-07-07 15:26:53] dude-x: it should only be in functions inside the class

[2014-07-07 15:27:22] ShadowXOR: i can do this fine with stupid stuff like creating instance of animal classes and stuff :O
[2014-07-07 15:27:23] ShadowXOR: lol
[2014-07-07 15:27:27] dude-x: like i said, page objects are just regular classes in the boring OOP way
[2014-07-07 15:27:47] ShadowXOR: i thought maybe putting it outside of the function would make it available to all functions in the class or something
[2014-07-07 15:28:37] robpark, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 15:29:32] dude-x: if you put it outside the class, that makes it global to the module (file)

[2014-07-07 15:30:46] dude-x: it's not redundant
[2014-07-07 15:30:57] dude-x: it's telling you that this name is an instance variable
[2014-07-07 15:31:02] ShadowXOR: Is it OK to have imports in my page objects?
[2014-07-07 15:31:20] dude-x: even in java you write this.variable sometimes
[2014-07-07 15:31:34] dude-x: yes it's okay to import stuff
[2014-07-07 15:31:37] ShadowXOR: And should setup/teardown be programmed in the page objects, or just the tests?  I'm assuming the tests

[2014-07-07 15:43:00] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 759
[2014-07-07 15:43:09] dude-x: yes you can have a generic page object
[2014-07-07 15:43:16] dude-x: you can call it BasePage
[2014-07-07 15:43:32] ShadowXOR: B)
[2014-07-07 15:43:34] dude-x: it will have a whole bunch of functions that EVERRY page should have
[2014-07-07 15:43:59] dude-x: so instead of class LoginPage() it should be 'class LoginPage(BasePage):'...
[2014-07-07 15:44:13] ShadowXOR: sweet, subclass them.  got it
[2014-07-07 15:44:26] dude-x: yeah every page object is a subclass of BasePage
[2014-07-07 15:44:44] dude-x: you can skip the __init__ too
[2014-07-07 15:44:55] dude-x: just have base page do the __init__
[2014-07-07 15:45:10] dude-x: and that's where you can 'seed' the live driver object

[2014-07-07 15:49:51] dude-x: bad locators look like: XPATH: //div[1]/div[4]/span/div/input[3]
[2014-07-07 15:50:00] dude-x: the above is super specific
[2014-07-07 15:50:35] dude-x: better //div[@class="button_area"]//input

[2014-07-07 15:51:44] dude-x: i'd get mad if i see an XPATH like this: //div::following-sibling::descendent
[2014-07-07 15:51:53] dude-x: ARGH! why are you making me think!!!

[2014-07-07 15:52:29] dude-x: generally i use css selectors, and xpath for things like this :  //div[text()={0}] (match on text)
[2014-07-07 15:52:56] andeesoft: xpath vs. css?
[2014-07-07 15:53:00] dude-x: /div/div[@title="Thing"]/../div
[2014-07-07 15:53:18] dude-x: some people say xpath vs css is the same speed
[2014-07-07 15:53:26] dude-x: but in general i would go with css selectors if possible
[2014-07-07 15:53:59] dude-x: xpath for checking stuff in the parent of the element where the child element has some identifier
[2014-07-07 15:54:31] dude-x: or if i need to match on visible text because there is no identifying info in the general structure of the HTML
[2014-07-07 15:55:01] ShadowXOR: Man, PyCharm is a treat.
[2014-07-07 15:55:13] dude-x: pycharm is good. i bought a license.
[2014-07-07 15:55:28] dude-x: local history of files saved my butt when i deleted a whole bunch of stuff by mistake
[2014-07-07 15:55:36] ShadowXOR: I'm using community edition right now.  But it's making my life a lot easier than Sublime Text was.
[2014-07-07 15:55:56] dude-x: sublime text is a next text editor, but you want pycharm for all the help it gives you
[2014-07-07 15:56:02] dude-x: when writing python
[2014-07-07 15:56:13] dude-x: s/next/neat
[2014-07-07 15:56:48] ShadowXOR: yeah for sure.  the lack of autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and hints (at the level pycharm offers) really made it hard for me.
[2014-07-07 15:56:58] ShadowXOR: This is much more pleasant, and I mostly ignore the IDE for now and focus on code.

[2014-07-07 15:57:47] andeesoft: hmm... looks like a good free ide for python
[2014-07-07 16:02:14] jibran_, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-07-07 16:02:50] ShadowXOR: dude-x: Is it OK to create a new __init__ for a subclass if I have some specific stuff to do unique to that new subclass that I don't want to pollute the parrent with?
[2014-07-07 16:03:05] dude-x: yes
[2014-07-07 16:03:10] ShadowXOR: andeesoft: It's amazing, IMO.  I thought you were using java though so I didn't say anything, I'm focusing 100% python right now.
[2014-07-07 16:03:31] dude-x: IntelliJ is for Java

[2014-07-07 16:07:23] ShadowXOR: dude-x: Should I create static methods so I don't have to instantiate classes to create my tests, or should I just instantiate them?
[2014-07-07 16:08:10] dude-x: hmm
[2014-07-07 16:08:17] dude-x: you can make them class methods i usppose
[2014-07-07 16:08:42] dude-x: this won't initialize the class though
[2014-07-07 16:09:21] ShadowXOR: I guess it feels strange instantiating an object when I don't really want the object just the methods.
[2014-07-07 16:11:01] dude-x: the page object needs a live driver though
[2014-07-07 16:11:20] ShadowXOR: Ah...yeah.

[2014-07-07 16:14:02] ShadowXOR: is it OK for my test classes to be subclasses of base page to use those generic functions or is that a nono and i need a base test class?
[2014-07-07 16:14:46] dude-x: test classes?
[2014-07-07 16:14:51] dude-x: test classes are indepedent
[2014-07-07 16:15:05] dude-x: if you use py.test, the class just orgainzes your data
[2014-07-07 16:15:22] dude-x: unittest lets you sublcass testcase so that you can do interesting setup/teardown
[2014-07-07 16:15:48] dude-x: but a general rule of writing tests is that all of your tests should be independent of each other
