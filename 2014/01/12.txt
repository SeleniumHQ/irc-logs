[2014-01-12 10:40:29] railis: I want to prepare a webpage tests, with couple of clicks
[2014-01-12 10:40:45] railis: but there is one page, i have a flash video recorder
[2014-01-12 10:41:12] railis: each time selenium opens a browser in new session, there is a flash privacy popup, asking for camera/mic access
[2014-01-12 10:41:33] railis: is there any option to bypas this, because I'm not able to click this popup in automated way
[2014-01-12 10:48:38] Zeusdude: chromes mic access confirmation dialog only appears once if the service is running through https
[2014-01-12 10:48:58] Zeusdude: maybe something similar could be used with flash
[2014-01-12 10:51:15] railis: nope, flash settings are kind of external and global, and have nothing to do with protocol
[2014-01-12 10:51:35] railis: can I force selenium to open a browser using actual sesion?

I just need to see something to be able to wrap my head around it. Using the gmail login page would be the perfect example. I *think* I need to make a class to hold the page object, then another class to manipulate them (enter logon name and password).

[2014-01-12 21:28:06] bcows: When using the selenium webdriver(s) to trigger an ajax request on a page, is there some flag you have to set to make it preserv/send the authentication cookie that was brought down with the inital page load?
[2014-01-12 21:32:57] p_l: bcows: the browser should send it naturally the same way as if it goes for js code in the page
[2014-01-12 21:35:14] bcows: p_l I am loading the page then using ExecuteAsyncScript to run some javascript that does an ajax call, it seems that the auth cookie is not sent with the ajax call
[2014-01-12 21:35:50] p_l: hmm
[2014-01-12 21:36:05] p_l: haven't used the async version
