[2014-02-12 02:43:04] HowardwLo: I'm looping through a ton of user accounts on my site using selenium, each user has a unique id. I don't want to check accounts that i've already done in the past, whats the best way to record a history and check against it? I currently have a json file that is read and dumped each pass through the loop, but it seems to slow down the whole looping process.
[2014-02-12 02:43:09] HowardwLo: any advice? :)
[2014-02-12 02:44:11] barancev|2: keep it in memory
[2014-02-12 02:45:21] simonstewart, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-12 02:48:03] HowardwLo: could you elaborate?
[2014-02-12 02:48:39] HowardwLo: sometimes, due to my terrible coding skills, selenium fails and i have to restart it. I would like it to keep that history :O
[2014-02-12 02:49:40] barancev|2: don't dump/parse on each iteration, create a finally block or a teardowm method that is executed even after an exception and dump the results in this block only
[2014-02-12 02:50:18] HowardwLo: ohh
[2014-02-12 02:50:24] HowardwLo: i think i get what you mean
[2014-02-12 02:51:05] HowardwLo: would it be a try finally thing?
[2014-02-12 02:51:18] barancev|2: yes

[2014-02-12 02:55:36] HowardwLo: would i put the try over the while loop?
[2014-02-12 02:57:05] barancev|2: yes, load before the loop. and dump in a finally block
[2014-02-12 02:58:14] HowardwLo: https://gist.github.com/Howardwlo/8953402

[2014-02-12 08:53:35] jimevans: i mean, i can speak in general terms about what the IE driver does when you click an <option> in a <select> element, but without reproducible cases, i can't provide concrete reasons why what you're trying doesn't work.

[2014-02-12 08:57:06] cgoldberg: to make thing harder.. the sample should be minimal, showing off the exact problem, without adding any other complexities... usually once you have whittled things down to that, you've solved it yourself anyway :)

[2014-02-12 14:17:35] HowardwLo: jleyba: so you just use set() on an array/list ?

[2014-02-12 14:19:37] ato: HowardwLo: A set should be significantly faster provided you don't need duplicate entries.
[2014-02-12 14:19:39] barancev|2: if I replace driver.switchTo().frame(index) with driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElements(By.tagName("iframe")).get(index)) all browsers are consistent
[2014-02-12 14:19:56] HowardwLo: ato: i check against duplicates, so a set would be perfect
[2014-02-12 14:19:57] barancev|2: so switching by index *is* ambiguous!
[2014-02-12 14:20:14] ato: HowardwLo: Using a set, you can actually remove those duplication checks altogether.
[2014-02-12 14:20:37] lukeis: barancev|2: only for dynamically generated dom's :)
[2014-02-12 14:20:47] HowardwLo: ato: how so? I'm currently using if X not in list: ...
[2014-02-12 14:20:47] lukeis: (javascript manipulated that is...)
[2014-02-12 14:21:16] lukeis: HowardwLo:  set.add("something");  set.add("something");   <-   len(set) == 1

[2014-02-12 14:21:56] lukeis: barancev|2: i'm full of them ;)
[2014-02-12 14:22:09] HowardwLo: so if x = set([1,2,3]), x.add("3"); x.add("4"); --> x = set([1,2,3,4]) ?
[2014-02-12 14:22:34] ato: HowardwLo: Exactly!
[2014-02-12 14:22:58] HowardwLo: neat. I'm guessing a dump to json would be similar to an array dump?
[2014-02-12 14:23:09] ato: A set is by mathematical definition a concept of a finite set without duplicates.
[2014-02-12 14:23:10] HowardwLo: in json it would show up as [1,2,3,4] ?
[2014-02-12 14:23:46] drharmony, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-02-12 14:23:49] ato: list(x) would cast/convert it to a list for serialization in JSON.

[2014-02-12 14:24:02] ato: Since x is a set, it would return [1,2,3,4] as you say.
[2014-02-12 14:24:03] HowardwLo: ah ok, awesomez
[2014-02-12 14:24:09] HowardwLo: and loading the json
[2014-02-12 14:24:17] HowardwLo: i would need to set() the list
[2014-02-12 14:24:25] ato: Right.
[2014-02-12 14:24:35] ato: Which is the same thing as you do when constructing a set in Python.
[2014-02-12 14:24:50] ato: Because [1,2,3,4] is a list.
[2014-02-12 14:25:23] ato: (Roughly.  IIRC it's not exactly the truth until you store it.)
[2014-02-12 14:25:30] HowardwLo: so if I'm checking if X exists in a set, would it be the same if statement as a list?
[2014-02-12 14:25:48] HowardwLo: if X not in set:
[2014-02-12 14:25:52] ato: Yes.

[2014-02-12 15:39:01] AutomatedTester: and we should be using that
[2014-02-12 15:39:04] barancev|2: and my point is: this is a good justification to deprecate swithTo().frame by index
[2014-02-12 15:39:34] barancev|2: because it is not consistent among browsers
