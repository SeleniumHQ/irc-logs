[2014-05-11 18:56:15] [1]panda: what language are you using?
[2014-05-11 18:56:19] Zyrax, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-11 18:56:20] ak5: node.js
[2014-05-11 18:56:27] ak5: or python
[2014-05-11 18:56:30] ak5: still unsure :D
[2014-05-11 18:56:43] nikgod, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-05-11 18:56:52] [1]panda: I would use python
[2014-05-11 18:57:13] [1]panda: since your websites use javascript it's better not to inject your own
[2014-05-11 18:57:47] [1]panda: this way your test won't affect the normal operation of the site
[2014-05-11 18:57:50] ak5: do you know anything about the mem/cpu reqs of selenium
[2014-05-11 18:58:16] [1]panda: unfortunately i don't
