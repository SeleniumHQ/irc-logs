[2014-11-10 02:23:21] WhereIsMySpoon: ghormoon: is some other process killing it off when you run it in user mode that doesnt have permission to in root?

[2014-11-10 02:26:01] WhereIsMySpoon: ghormoon: i have no idea how to detect what is killing an app, maybe #linux or your distro channel will have a better idea of how to do that
[2014-11-10 02:26:38] WhereIsMySpoon: if it is an outside process killing it that is
[2014-11-10 02:27:07] ghormoon: I;ve just googled that 126 means permission problem and found out that the scipt google-chromedriver is 755, but chromedriver itself 700

[2014-11-10 02:55:01] bosnjak: so i need to setup the selenium-server on the remote machine with the Xvfb and the browser installed, and from my "local" machine (actualy Jenkins server with the Java integration tests) I execute the tests?

I believe there's a way to use it in the current IE Driver Server, but I'm not sure exactly how… i'd have to wait and ask jimevans

[2014-11-10 15:10:41] slawrence00: When I try to open a saved Test Suite in my Selenium IDE each of the tests have an href looking like this:  href="../../../../../../" and when I load the suite the IDX complains that it cannot find the test. This happens every time I save a suite and try to re-open it later. Any ideas?

[2014-11-10 15:23:29] RockyChannel: hey
[2014-11-10 15:25:23] RockyChannel: hey guyzz, i am beginner in selenium webdriver..can anybody let me know which is advantageous among WebDriverWait and ImplicitWait
[2014-11-10 15:25:24] RockyChannel: ?
[2014-11-10 15:25:40] lukeis: webdriverwait :)
[2014-11-10 15:25:49] *lukeis hates implicit ;)'
[2014-11-10 15:26:11] AutomatedTester: lukeis: explain why...
[2014-11-10 15:26:17] RockyChannel: oh !!! do you have any exact reason for it?
[2014-11-10 15:26:27] lukeis: implicit implies you don't understand the state of your application, nor where the timing issues lie
[2014-11-10 15:26:57] lukeis: it's a convenience to some, but you can end up with extra waiting in your tests that you don't intend to have
[2014-11-10 15:27:07] lukeis: extra wait == longer test execution
[2014-11-10 15:30:04] ato: jleyba: https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/2870322176/hBB14B498/
[2014-11-10 15:32:46] lukeis: loving the ® on that too ;)
[2014-11-10 15:33:16] RockyChannel: thanks lukeis
[2014-11-10 15:33:18] smccarthy: i don't like implicit wait because if I want to do a click on an element and the element SHOULD be there, I don't want to wait X seconds.
[2014-11-10 15:33:35] ato: lukeis: 100% virgin pulp!

[2014-11-10 15:47:10] lukeis: shouldn't
[2014-11-10 15:47:20] RockyChannel: as it checks the condition after every 500 milli second?
[2014-11-10 15:47:34] lukeis: yes, default does that… but you can always change that
[2014-11-10 15:47:54] RockyChannel: hmmm, can you please let me know how?
[2014-11-10 15:48:03] lukeis: depends on what language
[2014-11-10 15:48:10] RockyChannel: i am using c#

[2014-11-10 16:05:03] eric__: can i verify that node is connected via the selenium grid console?
[2014-11-10 16:05:11] bbark123: yes
[2014-11-10 16:05:24] eric__: bbark123: how?
[2014-11-10 16:05:29] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-10 16:05:51] bbark123: If the grid is running on your local machine, go to this in your web browser: localhost:4444/grid/console
[2014-11-10 16:05:57] eric__: k, im there
[2014-11-10 16:06:11] bbark123: it should show up on that page if it is connected
[2014-11-10 16:06:13] eric__: if its listed under web-driver, does that mean its listed?
[2014-11-10 16:06:36] eric__: bbark123: can you point me to a screen shot of what i should see?
[2014-11-10 16:06:43] bbark123: Each node may have several of them, yes

[2014-11-10 16:08:12] bbark123: Are you having issues getting it to run correctly?
[2014-11-10 16:08:22] eric__: not at the moment
[2014-11-10 16:08:29] eric__: i just wasnt sure what i was looking at
[2014-11-10 16:08:35] eric__: ok, so each box is a node
[2014-11-10 16:08:52] eric__: sweet, thank you
[2014-11-10 16:08:52] bbark123: yes, each box is a node, and a node can run several browsers, if desired
