[2014-11-04 09:36:43] jimevans: and they code share with alaska so TPA-SEA is relatively easy.

[2014-11-04 11:47:32] jleyba: dimacus: IIRC cookie tests get skipped if it doesn't have a valid domain to test with

[2014-11-04 11:48:19] jleyba: I suspect that failure is due to an error returned by SafariDriver getting mangled by the remote server, and for local runs you talk directly to SD
[2014-11-04 11:48:53] dimacus: yup that's why i'm setting up a remote grid just for that, to see if running it remotely (like we do with sauce) is causing it
[2014-11-04 11:49:21] barancev: moreover, you neeed to setup *two* domains
[2014-11-04 11:49:35] dimacus: esto complicado

[2014-11-04 12:46:44] jimevans: not that i'm opposed to buying AutomatedTester a beer (or multiple beers), and don't need a reason to do so.
[2014-11-04 12:46:51] zsi: Answer to my question please: is there a way to determine from plain javascript (from all available browsers, running WebDriver) - is we use WebDriver or not ? Thank you.
[2014-11-04 12:47:32] jimevans: zsi: not currently, no.
[2014-11-04 12:47:46] zsi: in FF in DOM, i heard - exists dynamic attribute "webdriver"
[2014-11-04 12:48:08] jimevans: zsi: in theory, all drivers are supposed to "tag" the DOM with an attribute, but not all drivers follow this rule.
[2014-11-04 12:48:09] zsi: in <html>
[2014-11-04 12:48:47] jimevans: i believe there's language in the :spec to that effect (or there used to be), but again, you're limited to what the drivers actually implement

[2014-11-04 12:52:50] jimevans: firefox does. dunno about chrome, but i'd guess not.
[2014-11-04 12:53:04] zsi: .. for the latest version of WebDriver binary plugins for this browsers
[2014-11-04 12:53:38] jimevans: remember that firefox is the only one that is implemented as a browser extention. other drivers are implemented in different ways.
[2014-11-04 12:54:22] zsi: yes, i heard - for FF exists "Marionette way" for perform operations
[2014-11-04 12:55:09] jimevans: zsi: don't confuse the current firefox implementation with marionette.
[2014-11-04 12:55:32] jimevans: marionette is a future firefox driver implementation provided by mozilla.
[2014-11-04 12:55:44] jimevans: it's available in some form now, but it's not complete yet.
[2014-11-04 12:57:10] zsi: jimevans: yes, i'm distinguish it
[2014-11-04 12:58:43] zsi: seen in the Java source code WebDriver, it is possible to use Marionette, and have not tried
