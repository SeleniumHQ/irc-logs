[2014-11-06 08:37:30] dimacus: 2) if it's not there, open safari via applescript, open the extension file via apple script, click "Install" button that pops up
[2014-11-06 08:37:39] dimacus: 3) Close Safar, repeat step 1

[2014-11-06 09:49:11] lukeis: jleyba: the thing about java is that it *will* work, since the execute will coerce the response into a list… but then the method you reference will return a string of that list… so it 'works'… python just fails entirely
[2014-11-06 09:49:27] lukeis: lists as a return value to get attribute? … that's just not supported though
[2014-11-06 09:49:47] lukeis: appium should produce their own binding extension to support that use case
[2014-11-06 09:50:25] jleyba: lukeis: I don't think Java works b/c it depends on the list implementation for what you get on the string conversion
[2014-11-06 09:51:30] jleyba: It might happen to work right now, but it's purely coincidence (perhaps we should add an assertion that the response has the expected type?)

[2014-11-06 12:28:45] dimacus: ok so the idea is to pull out the Socket part of Safari into a seporate app that acts as a request proxy into the Safari Extension. Whenver the Extension runs short, such as anable to deal with JS, the proxy server would delegate that to apple script
[2014-11-06 12:30:02] losh, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-06 12:30:33] jleyba: yes
[2014-11-06 12:30:35] *dimacus does not want to re-write the whole driver in a new language… but a fresh start might be useful'
[2014-11-06 12:31:07] dimacus: swift does not look bad at all to be honest
[2014-11-06 12:31:13] mach6, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-06 12:32:14] jleyba: wait, you're suggesting writing the entire thing in applescript (e.g. navigation, clicks, keys) and use the extension for JS? (executeScript, isDisplayed, etc)?
[2014-11-06 12:32:53] dimacus: i don't know if i'd go that far… just saying that some things like Alerts are giving problems to safaridriver atm
[2014-11-06 12:33:09] dimacus: since JS is blocking, so dealing with those things can be accomplished with AppleScript
[2014-11-06 12:33:23] jleyba: safaridriver can detect when there's an alert
[2014-11-06 12:33:32] jleyba: it just has to deal with it immediately b/c is js is blocking

[2014-11-06 12:33:53] dimacus: yeah that's what i'm talking about, the aler is overwritten with another function
[2014-11-06 12:34:02] ism: There is a SafariBrowser?
[2014-11-06 12:34:02] jleyba: change that to: detect alert, notify proxy.
[2014-11-06 12:34:10] wdj, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-11-06 12:34:15] dimacus: ahhhhh
[2014-11-06 12:34:28] jleyba: proxy could then use applescript to interact with the alert according to the normal webdriver api
[2014-11-06 12:34:39] dimacus: yeah that's what i'm thinking
[2014-11-06 12:34:50] dimacus: i think we are in violent agreement
[2014-11-06 12:36:00] jleyba: re: using AppleScript for mouse & keyboard input, I'm not familiar with how reliable that is, but we might be able to do some nasty stuff like focus with js, type keys with as
[2014-11-06 12:36:16] jleyba: s/we/you/ :-)
[2014-11-06 12:36:33] dimacus: yeah i've been messing with it all day
[2014-11-06 12:36:57] dimacus: using AppleScript i'm able to hit the "Install" plugin button even when safari is out of focus under 20 windwos
[2014-11-06 12:37:10] dimacus: so it's actually pretty damn power automation API
[2014-11-06 12:37:16] dimacus: however, the syntax is just horrific
[2014-11-06 12:38:04] jleyba: Should probably keep it simple for now and start with handling alerts
[2014-11-06 12:38:26] dimacus: actually even simpler than that… automatically installing the safari extension on 10.10

Is testing Chrome and Firefox on Linux the same as on Windows? I would think it wouldn't be the same at all. Or is it likely that people just have a lot of linux folks going to their website? (I know that is not the case with the websites I test).

[2014-11-06 15:04:50] nirvdrum: I'll take a look.  But if Selenium Server thinks you have a session going, that could be the problem.  That's what all the webdriver timeout params are for.
[2014-11-06 15:07:26] nirvdrum: And it's not designed to allow multiple commands to run at the same time for the same session.
[2014-11-06 15:07:35] RajatJIndal: oh the session is still valid, its just that one of the request got stuck

[2014-11-06 15:08:21] RajatJIndal: yeah, but this is a dead end for the test until we restart the session. and its happening way too frequently to ignore it
[2014-11-06 15:08:31] nirvdrum: barancev: If the firefox driver is broken, you have bigger problems.
[2014-11-06 15:08:42] barancev: yes, it is a bug, but we can report it and attempt to continue with the next command
[2014-11-06 15:09:31] RajatJIndal: yeah, i was thinking to replace future.get() with future.get(long timeout, TimeUnit unit),
[2014-11-06 15:09:40] nirvdrum: That's a possibility, but now you're in an unknown state.  My understanding is Selenium's thesis has been to be catastrophic rather than probabilistic.
[2014-11-06 15:10:17] nirvdrum: Anyway, I'll check it out.  But my guess is this isn't a multi-threaded issue.  And that the timeouts would eventually return control to the client.
[2014-11-06 15:10:17] barancev: it should be catastrophic in the mean that we throw an exception if a command is not complete in time
[2014-11-06 15:10:55] barancev: if a client wants to continue after an exception he is on its own
