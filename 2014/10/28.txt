[2014-10-28 05:32:22] barancev: what Java version do you use?
[2014-10-28 05:32:49] slyder: java version "1.7.0_65"
[2014-10-28 05:32:49] slyder: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.5.3) (7u71-2.5.3-0ubuntu0.14.04.1)
[2014-10-28 05:32:49] slyder: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.65-b04, mixed mode)
[2014-10-28 05:33:07] WhereIsMySpoon: should be fine
[2014-10-28 05:34:18] slyder: i have 1 cpu, and 500mg of memory on VPS, could this bring this issue?
[2014-10-28 05:34:19] barancev: is Oracle Java available in your system? try to use it instead of OpenJDK
[2014-10-28 05:34:26] WhereIsMySpoon: 500mg?
[2014-10-28 05:34:28] WhereIsMySpoon: :p
[2014-10-28 05:34:48] WhereIsMySpoon: slyder: nah, selenium server doesnt take much juice
[2014-10-28 05:35:15] slyder: *mb i mean )
[2014-10-28 05:35:25] WhereIsMySpoon: barancev: openjdk is usually superior over the oracle versions for linux
[2014-10-28 05:35:35] barancev: it seems that random generator can't read from /dev/random
[2014-10-28 05:35:53] barancev: or /dev/urandom
[2014-10-28 05:35:58] barancev: or both :)
[2014-10-28 05:36:07] WhereIsMySpoon: so its a linux issue then?
[2014-10-28 05:36:36] barancev: unix-like
[2014-10-28 05:36:40] barancev: that macos is
[2014-10-28 05:36:49] WhereIsMySpoon: oh yea hes on mac

[2014-10-28 05:37:21] WhereIsMySpoon: well i have the jenkins plugin for selenium running fine
[2014-10-28 05:37:25] WhereIsMySpoon: on a linux box
[2014-10-28 05:37:30] barancev: but it is closed in Oracle Java 7
[2014-10-28 05:37:30] WhereIsMySpoon: which runs a server
[2014-10-28 05:38:06] WhereIsMySpoon: it isnt ubuntu admittedly
[2014-10-28 05:38:23] WhereIsMySpoon: but reading from /dev/(u)random isnt really dist-specific
[2014-10-28 05:38:45] slyder: i have other ubuntu in virtual box on other pc, and it works fine also... so it is very strange issue
[2014-10-28 05:39:22] WhereIsMySpoon: slyder: same java version, same selenium version?
[2014-10-28 05:39:31] WhereIsMySpoon: same ubuntu version?

[2014-10-28 08:01:46] WhereIsMySpoon: Im having an issue with one of my tests - there is a link im pressing that is below the next link I press. With firefoxdriver, when I do .click() on the first link, the page is scrolled down so that that link is at the top of the page, and the second link I want to click after is no longer viewable, therefore breaking the test. This doesnt happen o
[2014-10-28 08:01:46] WhereIsMySpoon: n chrome, or even on firefox normally if I manually click the link or do .click() in the javascript console, it's only with selenium
[2014-10-28 08:03:10] WhereIsMySpoon: not really sure what to do about this...I thought that selenium didnt care whether a thing was in view scroll wise when it tried to press it
[2014-10-28 08:03:20] WhereIsMySpoon: if it wasnt, it would scroll to it
[2014-10-28 08:03:32] WhereIsMySpoon: though im not sure why the page is scrolling when this link is pressed
[2014-10-28 08:04:51] WhereIsMySpoon: anyone able to help me out please?
[2014-10-28 08:07:16] Dave_B_: public or private page?
[2014-10-28 08:07:42] WhereIsMySpoon: Dave_B_: private
[2014-10-28 08:08:12] Dave_B_: inevitably, always the way :( any public-facing version that surfaces same behaviour?
[2014-10-28 08:08:36] WhereIsMySpoon: no, its ip restricted
[2014-10-28 08:08:40] Dave_B_: rats
[2014-10-28 08:09:11] Dave_B_: ff version & webdriver version?
[2014-10-28 08:09:49] WhereIsMySpoon: 32 and 2.44.0
[2014-10-28 08:10:21] cable: WhereIsMySpoon
[2014-10-28 08:10:31] WhereIsMySpoon: cable:
[2014-10-28 08:10:32] cable: usually I increase the viewport of selenium =)
[2014-10-28 08:10:42] cable: so I dont have to scroll ever xD
[2014-10-28 08:10:46] WhereIsMySpoon: cable: that doesnt help, it scrolls so that the first link is at the top of the page
[2014-10-28 08:10:56] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore the 2nd link is out of view
[2014-10-28 08:11:05] cable: ah.... scroll back xD!
[2014-10-28 08:11:10] WhereIsMySpoon: in an automated test
[2014-10-28 08:11:15] WhereIsMySpoon: ok
[2014-10-28 08:11:31] cable: create a scroll option in your test
[2014-10-28 08:11:35] cable: so it will have the view visible
[2014-10-28 08:11:58] WhereIsMySpoon: the thing is that this doesnt happen in chrome, and it doesnt even happen if I do .click() in firefox in the js console
[2014-10-28 08:12:00] WhereIsMySpoon: only with the driver
[2014-10-28 08:12:01] cable: its the only thing I can think of and it seems also like a bug xD. I hadthe problem before as well. only solution is to make it visible on the view port.
[2014-10-28 08:12:28] cable: the webdriver is more like a user instead of a automated test.
[2014-10-28 08:12:43] WhereIsMySpoon: cable: yes, that would be acceptable if this behaviour happened normally when u click the button
[2014-10-28 08:12:46] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt though
[2014-10-28 08:12:54] WhereIsMySpoon: the page doesnt scroll normally, only when in this automated test
[2014-10-28 08:13:00] Dave_B_: should auto-scroll up - wonder why it isn't :(
[2014-10-28 08:13:05] WhereIsMySpoon: also this ^
[2014-10-28 08:13:14] cable: hmm.... thats actually weird o.0
[2014-10-28 08:13:22] WhereIsMySpoon: it shouldnt matter anyway cause selenium should scroll teh page
[2014-10-28 08:13:29] WhereIsMySpoon: but it shouldnt be scrolling on click in the first place
[2014-10-28 08:13:38] cable: you're right xD
[2014-10-28 08:13:41] cable: that seems buggy
[2014-10-28 08:13:57] cable: a click that scrolls o.0
[2014-10-28 08:14:08] Dave_B_: just bumped to 2.44 to see if i have same trouble

[2014-10-28 08:18:47] Dave_B_: is it always scrolling or only for some clicks?
[2014-10-28 08:19:11] WhereIsMySpoon: every time it hits that link it scrolls
[2014-10-28 08:19:24] WhereIsMySpoon: and the link next to it
[2014-10-28 08:19:44] errant_rider: has anyone used a tool to display graphical results from database queries?  I'm trying to have a tool that will display number of passes/fails for a test run based on some criteria?  I'm not finding much like that online...

[2014-10-28 08:25:54] almostwhitehat: I frequently run into issues attempting to click animated elements (ie. a modal that is sliding into view) and my solution was to override the clicking behavior to check the X, Y position, sleep for 1/10th of a second, and check the positions again. If it’s the same, it clicks, otherwise it sleeps again.
[2014-10-28 08:26:01] almostwhitehat: Have you guys come up with any better solutions for this?
[2014-10-28 08:27:30] WhereIsMySpoon: almostwhitehat: is there no attribute on it you can check for it animating?
[2014-10-28 08:28:17] diancho, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-28 08:29:00] almostwhitehat: There usually is - but working with a few different frameworks (jQuery, angular, etc.) makes me not want to have to be cognizant of potential animations throught my test suite, and handle them in a bunch of places.
[2014-10-28 08:29:52] WhereIsMySpoon: then I would imagine that your solution sounds reasonable

[2014-10-28 08:59:20] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: no, this is on some local .html files
[2014-10-28 08:59:32] AutomatedTester: I thought it might have been mixed content

[2014-10-28 09:00:15] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: is this via fileL

[2014-10-28 09:00:35] WhereIsMySpoon: yes
[2014-10-28 09:01:40] AutomatedTester: ahh that might be it
[2014-10-28 09:01:54] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-10-28 09:01:59] AutomatedTester: Firefox doesn't really like file:/// urls because of security issues
[2014-10-28 09:02:04] WhereIsMySpoon: ugh
[2014-10-28 09:02:16] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: try the full path in your JS
[2014-10-28 09:02:20] AutomatedTester: and see if that loads it
[2014-10-28 09:02:26] WhereIsMySpoon: oh, i was giving the full path in the js
[2014-10-28 09:02:40] WhereIsMySpoon: i thought u meant the url that is resolved in the top bar
[2014-10-28 09:03:19] WhereIsMySpoon: document.getElementById("frame").src = "C:\\blah\\whatever\\test.html"
[2014-10-28 09:03:40] lukeis: might be easier to run an http server locally and point to that ;)

[2014-10-28 09:04:47] WhereIsMySpoon: well I was doing this because I was having some issues earlier with firefoxdriver auto-scrolling links that are clicked on to the top of the screen
[2014-10-28 09:04:51] *lukeis hates windows file system with a passion ;)'
[2014-10-28 09:04:57] WhereIsMySpoon: whcih then means that elements above it dont get clicked
[2014-10-28 09:05:07] *dimacus hates windows lock system on the file system'
[2014-10-28 09:05:08] cable: I hate the folder structure not being able to nest deep folders xD
[2014-10-28 09:05:15] cable: in some cases its very handy of having VERY long paths xD
[2014-10-28 09:05:28] WhereIsMySpoon: lukeis, AutomatedTester do you have any idea about this?
[2014-10-28 09:05:58] lukeis: about what? the auto-scroll? yes webdriver calls element.scrollIntoView()
[2014-10-28 09:06:02] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: we scroll when we think the element is not in the viewport
[2014-10-28 09:06:10] WhereIsMySpoon: no, i think you misunderstood
[2014-10-28 09:06:24] WhereIsMySpoon: I have an element at point x, and another element above it
[2014-10-28 09:06:27] AutomatedTester: no, I think your question was poorly formulated :)
[2014-10-28 09:06:38] WhereIsMySpoon: when I click the first element, the page is scrolled so that the first element is now at the top of the page viewport
[2014-10-28 09:06:45] WhereIsMySpoon: meaning that the second one is above it, out of view
[2014-10-28 09:06:54] WhereIsMySpoon: the page is then never scrolled back to the second one when it is clicked
[2014-10-28 09:07:31] WhereIsMySpoon: and my test just fails
[2014-10-28 09:07:58] WhereIsMySpoon: this scrolling of the first element only happens when I click it via selenium, not normally or even with js
[2014-10-28 09:08:41] cable: selenium bug xD
[2014-10-28 09:09:01] cable: limit your selenium to that .39 version and issue a bug in .43 on github
[2014-10-28 09:09:08] WhereIsMySpoon: it does teh same in .39
[2014-10-28 09:09:12] cable: oh...
[2014-10-28 09:10:01] AutomatedTester: WhereIsMySpoon: kinda like http://jsbin.com/catimicago/1?
[2014-10-28 09:10:21] AutomatedTester: so you click on foo and it scrolls and then doesnt scroll back to bar?
[2014-10-28 09:10:48] cable: nice quick mockup :)
[2014-10-28 09:11:40] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: I click on bar and it scrolls so that foo is now above the viewport and it doesnt scroll back to foo when I click on foo
[2014-10-28 09:11:41] lukeis: the way i read his problem, he clicks on bar first, (foo is scrolled out of view) and then clicking foo never scrolls foo back into view
[2014-10-28 09:11:50] WhereIsMySpoon: correct luke :)
[2014-10-28 09:12:18] lukeis: and with that… we need a :repro test case

[2014-10-28 09:13:37] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: sure

[2014-10-28 09:21:31] WhereIsMySpoon: i was haing issues reproing the initial scrolling on click
[2014-10-28 09:21:42] WhereIsMySpoon: i didnt try reproing the non scrolling of the 2nd element back into view

[2014-10-28 09:27:19] WhereIsMySpoon: AutomatedTester: http://jsbin.com/wihebuhetu/2/ something like this works fine, it scrolls back into view if I manually scroll the top one out of view, and also doesnt scroll in teh first place anyway

[2014-10-28 10:20:14] lukeis: i think you can extract it from the jar

[2014-10-28 10:30:20] AutomatedTester: it will be done
[2014-10-28 10:30:46] tkueck: Selenium question: I have a modal that loads a list of N elements via javascript call. There is no visible load/please wait element to find/wait for. Likewise, the list of N elements is dynamic and not a guaranteed length. Is there a good way to wait when there are no visible side effects?
[2014-10-28 10:30:49] tourdedave: Any sense on how long?
[2014-10-28 10:31:00] tkueck: I'm running into stale references because I get hte list, and then more items load
[2014-10-28 10:31:11] WhereIsMySpoon: tkueck: what are you trying to achieve after its loaded?
[2014-10-28 10:31:18] tkueck: I want to click some of those elements
[2014-10-28 10:31:29] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-10-28 10:31:47] tkueck: I can get around it by a hard sleep, but magic numbers/hard sleeps are not really great because they don't adjust for any amount of network lag
[2014-10-28 10:32:00] Neo--, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-28 10:32:08] WhereIsMySpoon: so when this modal is loading, you try to click element a. it then loads some more elemnets, and I assume re-jigs the layout cause more loaded?
[2014-10-28 10:32:16] WhereIsMySpoon: therefore causing stales
[2014-10-28 10:32:21] WhereIsMySpoon: ?
[2014-10-28 10:32:23] tkueck: yes
[2014-10-28 10:32:31] jleyba, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-28 10:32:41] WhereIsMySpoon: are you storing webelements as local variables?
[2014-10-28 10:32:51] WhereIsMySpoon: if so, convert to just using Bys and looking up the element each time
[2014-10-28 10:32:53] tkueck: getAllElements > clickFirstElement > stale reference because more elements have loaded so list of all elements is now different from what exists on the page
[2014-10-28 10:33:17] WhereIsMySpoon: i see
[2014-10-28 10:33:30] WhereIsMySpoon: maybe you should add some sort of "finished" indicator
[2014-10-28 10:33:36] WhereIsMySpoon: it would be useful for the users too :)
[2014-10-28 10:33:51] tkueck: That's sort of hte issue, the lack of finished indicator is because it does lazy loading/infinite scroll
[2014-10-28 10:35:22] WhereIsMySpoon: hmm
[2014-10-28 10:36:04] tkueck: I had the idea of "getAllElements > get unique identifier of elements >  refind elements"
[2014-10-28 10:36:14] tkueck: I think that'd get around it, but seems really ugly
[2014-10-28 10:36:17] WhereIsMySpoon: you cant get the By of a WebElement
[2014-10-28 10:36:28] WhereIsMySpoon: it doesnt exist
[2014-10-28 10:36:48] tkueck: We have unique HTML attributes we use that can be used to identify elements
[2014-10-28 10:36:54] mdas, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-28 10:37:06] WhereIsMySpoon: so why are you not using that instead of getallelements
[2014-10-28 10:37:29] tkueck: Becuase I have a list of elements and I want to interact with some unknown quantity of those elements
[2014-10-28 10:37:49] WhereIsMySpoon: but you just said you have some unique html attrs

[2014-10-28 10:39:55] tkueck: Because that list isn't a guaranteed list, it changes based off inputs
[2014-10-28 10:40:33] WhereIsMySpoon: ok, but since its a static test, you'lre going to be putting in static inputs

[2014-10-28 11:29:21] honeyboo123: I took honeybooboo because my regular one, jimb, which is _actually_ based on my name was password protected (not by me)
[2014-10-28 11:29:41] dimacus: barancev: jleyba: lukeis: so i'm working to get some dedicated work time to fix some SafariDriver issues in the bug tracker, especially dealing with stability. Aside from the currently open defects, does SafariDriver need any TODO items to bring it to current version of webdriver? that is, as of version 2.X all browser but Safari support click. Just trying to give a small summary of work that needs to be done.

[2014-10-28 11:30:14] jimevans: dimacus: implement the interactions API.
[2014-10-28 11:30:20] honeyboo123: and I then do element.text (python)
[2014-10-28 11:30:35] dimacus: jimevans: do you have a wiki link?
[2014-10-28 11:30:37] honeyboo123: does that get the element again?

[2014-10-28 11:30:58] jleyba: dimacus: What do you mean "all browser but Safari support click"? Advanced interactions? Sure, there's a bug for that. WebElement.click() should be there and work (with caveats since Safari sucks)

[2014-10-28 11:31:24] honeyboo123: element.text
[2014-10-28 11:31:31] lukeis: honeyboo123: no, webdriver doesn't explicitly re-lookup any element
[2014-10-28 11:31:31] honeyboo123: nothing happens in between
[2014-10-28 11:31:40] honeyboo123: at least not that I have control over...
[2014-10-28 11:31:45] lukeis: it's a timing issue with the page loading or changing
[2014-10-28 11:31:58] honeyboo123: hum, that's the answer I was expecting but wasn't hoping for
[2014-10-28 11:32:01] dimacus: jleyba: doing a random analogy with click feature
[2014-10-28 11:32:02] lukeis: you can use one of the :waits to handle it
[2014-10-28 11:32:02] selbot2__: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.jsp#explicit-and-implicit-waits
[2014-10-28 11:32:05] honeyboo123: right, I know what the error is
[2014-10-28 11:32:22] honeyboo123: but when I'm not doing anything in between, what can possibly have changed?
[2014-10-28 11:32:24] lukeis: use an explicit wait :)
[2014-10-28 11:32:25] dimacus: jimevans: does interaction api mean how the atoms interact with safari?
[2014-10-28 11:32:27] jleyba: dimacus: No interactions API is the biggest feature gap for Safari
[2014-10-28 11:32:38] lukeis: honeyboo123: the web page, by a large number of things
[2014-10-28 11:32:47] orik, joining. (#selenium)
[2014-10-28 11:32:51] honeyboo123: I'm literally getting the element, and then accessing the text
[2014-10-28 11:32:59] honeyboo123: and it's not failing in getting the element
[2014-10-28 11:33:07] honeyboo123: it's failing when getting the text
[2014-10-28 11:33:18] dimacus: jleyba: ok that sounds like a good action item that i can try to sell, can i find an example of it in FF to port or get an idea about?
[2014-10-28 11:33:18] barancev: dimacus: run and review the tests, I hope @Ignore(SAFARI) marks are quite close to the actual situation
[2014-10-28 11:33:25] jimevans: dimacus: "interactions api" is using 'action chains' (python) or the Actions class (java/.NET)
[2014-10-28 11:33:34] honeyboo123: and if it' doesn't re-lookup an element, how is it then possible the reference is stale? :'(
[2014-10-28 11:34:08] jleyba: dimacus: I hate the FF code and will revert any of its ugliness that finds its way into the Safari code base (I may not want to maintain it, but that will rankle my OCD enough to get me involved)

[2014-10-28 11:34:38] dimacus: haha i hear you
[2014-10-28 11:34:44] jimevans: dimacus: the atoms for the interactions API already exist. they need to be wired up into the safari driver.
[2014-10-28 11:34:45] jleyba: dimacus: I believe jimevans used the atoms for interactions in win phone.  you basically need to do the same thing for safari
[2014-10-28 11:34:51] dimacus: code porting != feature porting
[2014-10-28 11:35:23] jleyba: the tricky bit is marshaling mouse+keyboard state from the global extension (which persists for the browser session) to the individual page (which would execute each command)
[2014-10-28 11:35:34] barancev: also, we have to implement "real" action chains
[2014-10-28 11:35:47] barancev: like it is already done in marionette
[2014-10-28 11:35:56] jleyba: state needs to be passed back and forth to prevent losing info when a new page loads

[2014-10-28 11:36:25] dimacus: ok some of it is starting to make sense
[2014-10-28 11:36:35] jleyba: Is anyone outside selenium dev using marionette? (Moz doesn't count)
[2014-10-28 11:36:45] honeyboo123: lukeis: Getting the element uses a wait
[2014-10-28 11:37:14] honeyboo123: so I know at the point of calling the element.text bit that I have a real element and not None
[2014-10-28 11:37:41] barancev: jleyba: it is not ready for use
[2014-10-28 11:38:05] jleyba: vaporware :-)
[2014-10-28 11:38:17] dimacus: would comparing the feature set between safari and marionette also a good dif for feature list?
[2014-10-28 11:38:21] barancev: marionette passed only ~half of the current selenium test set
[2014-10-28 11:39:12] barancev: (nightly Firefox version I mean)
[2014-10-28 11:39:14] jleyba: dimacus: my advice for Safari work
[2014-10-28 11:39:24] jleyba: 1) drop support for Windows and Safari 5.1.x
[2014-10-28 11:39:30] dimacus: +1,000
[2014-10-28 11:39:45] jleyba: 2) improve startup reliability
[2014-10-28 11:39:50] dimacus: ok
[2014-10-28 11:39:50] jleyba: 3) implement interactions API
[2014-10-28 11:40:36] dimacus: ok i really like the first 2 points
[2014-10-28 11:40:39] barancev: 4) improve the grid too
[2014-10-28 11:40:51] dimacus: 4 might be prioritized for us much higher
[2014-10-28 11:40:56] jleyba: what does grid have to do with Safari?
[2014-10-28 11:41:01] barancev: nothing :)
[2014-10-28 11:41:12] barancev: it is an independent item
[2014-10-28 11:41:16] dimacus: barancev: is trying to pull a feature creep stunt
[2014-10-28 11:41:28] dimacus: in my case i'm trying to improve safari build with the grid
[2014-10-28 11:41:33] dimacus: so this might all be related
[2014-10-28 11:41:54] jleyba: I've never used grid, so can't help you prioritize there. (hermetic VMs ftw!)
[2014-10-28 11:42:23] barancev: I think that many parts of grid-extras can be incorporated into the main grid body
[2014-10-28 11:42:26] dimacus: yeah yeah yeah, when you have enough money to burn $100 for office cubicle warmth everything is easy
[2014-10-28 11:42:48] dimacus: barancev: that's my hope but honestly don't think it's ready for that, but eventually that's my plan
[2014-10-28 11:43:50] jleyba: dimacus: since someone just pinged the safari alert bug, you might also want to take a stab at improving handling there
[2014-10-28 11:44:02] jleyba: not sure how much can be done since alerts block the js thread

[2014-10-28 11:55:01] dimacus: alright here is my pitch to the D level folks, https://gist.github.com/dimacus/066c9d9aad3147072d4c I'm watering it down a lot to make it look palatable, but basically i'm telling them that if they want Safari stability we need to sink some resources into this otherwise just drop support all together in our tests. So far they really want to keep safari build alive and would love to get some brownie points in the community… so here is to hoping
[2014-10-28 11:55:57] ato: dimacus: Sounds good, patches are welcome (-:

[2014-10-28 14:03:26] brockfredin: jimevans Thanks.  It's a SPA.  I removed the # and blank page state.  Is .NET somehow parsing the # as something different?  I go .toString and the URl is valid.

[2014-10-28 14:05:18] jimevans: brockfredin: as far as the .NET bindings are concerned, the URL that gets sent across the wire to the browser is pass-through. there's no parsing done whatsoever by the language bindings.
[2014-10-28 14:05:56] jimevans: does it happen in all browsers? one in particular? some subset?
[2014-10-28 14:06:51] brockfredin: jimevans Dude, you're smart.  Figured it out at the prompt of asking this question.  An extra / was added.  It now works.
[2014-10-28 14:07:26] jimevans: sgsabbage picked up on the trailing slash.
