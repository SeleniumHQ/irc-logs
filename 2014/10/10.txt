[2014-10-10 06:36:15] ato: Do you use implicit waits?
[2014-10-10 06:38:43] CSWookie: Yeah.
[2014-10-10 06:39:29] CSWookie: Which is bad, I know, but the library I'm working with uses them.
[2014-10-10 06:39:46] ato: I suspect that might have something to do with it.
[2014-10-10 06:40:05] ato: If your implicit wait is at 20s, that would explain why it's taking so long.
[2014-10-10 06:40:26] ato: Although it's strange that it should use that timeout when it's accessing an element reference.
[2014-10-10 06:40:35] CSWookie: It waits before telling me that the element is stale?  That seems kind of dumb.
[2014-10-10 06:40:57] CSWookie: I think the wait is actually 30 seconds.
[2014-10-10 06:40:59] ato: Yes, that shouldn't happen.
[2014-10-10 06:41:15] ato: Well you're in the position to check if it's the case (-:
[2014-10-10 06:41:32] CSWookie: Yeah, I'll dig around some more.  Thanks.

[2014-10-10 06:42:06] ato: tl;dr: It shouldn't take 20 seconds for it to tell you it's a stale element.
[2014-10-10 06:42:16] ato: It's a pretty simple check internally.

[2014-10-10 11:31:37] CSWookie: It'd be nice if I write an xpath that matches many things, I can stop looking for it when I get to the one I want, rather than get all the matches.  It seems unlikely to me, but I figured I'd ask.

[2014-10-10 11:55:39] CSWookie: dude-x: I dunno.  I hope I don't have to find out.  I hate Javascript.  It's like someone had a good idea for a language, and then broke it so that it would look like C.

[2014-10-10 11:58:41] dude-x: then you can just call iter(list_of_elements) in python
[2014-10-10 11:58:48] dude-x: and then process your elements
[2014-10-10 11:59:16] dude-x: but that buys you nothing really unless you have a really long list of elements to process
[2014-10-10 11:59:18] CSWookie: dude-x: yeah, but that doesn't give me laziness.  After all, the list has already been created at that point.

[2014-10-10 12:00:13] dude-x: but sometimes you can do computationally expensive stuff in python i suppose
[2014-10-10 12:01:22] CSWookie: Well, if it's the text operations that are killing me, I might have to break out the javascript and write some stuff to run my xpaths from there.
[2014-10-10 12:01:41] CSWookie: Which seems severely braindead.
[2014-10-10 12:02:46] dude-x: it should be fast to return elements that match an xpath

[2014-10-10 12:04:00] jleyba: dude-x: by.linkText is a compound operation: find all links, compute visible text, filter out those that do not match. doesn't use xpath

[2014-10-10 12:10:09] CSWookie: jleyba: YUK!  I assumed that if it was a special function it was optimized in some way.
[2014-10-10 12:10:41] CSWookie: Why does it do it that way?
[2014-10-10 12:11:11] dude-x: in 99% of the cases, when you want to test link text, that link has to be visible to the user
[2014-10-10 12:11:35] dude-x: although link text is unusual in that it does a visiblity check
[2014-10-10 12:11:38] CSWookie: So get the ones that match, and then filter out the ones that are hidden.
[2014-10-10 12:11:55] dude-x: yeah i guess that's one way
[2014-10-10 12:12:52] CSWookie: If I want the 'Click here' link, I don't care whether all those 'Click there' links are visible or not, because I don't want any of them.
[2014-10-10 12:13:04] dude-x: are you writing tests?
[2014-10-10 12:13:18] CSWookie: Yes.
[2014-10-10 12:13:40] dude-x: your tests shoudld be deterministic then, just grab the exact element you're looking for
[2014-10-10 12:14:27] jleyba, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2014-10-10 12:14:33] dude-x: unless the html is just <a href ...> <a href ...>; there's some structure to the webpage that allows you to narrow down the actual link you care about
[2014-10-10 12:14:44] selbot2_: 04 Open issues: 792
[2014-10-10 12:14:56] CSWookie: dude-x: How would you suggest I do that?  The structure of the html is not going to be the same, necessarily.  The product is under active developement.
[2014-10-10 12:15:37] dude-x: well good css selectors and xpath don't need to match the structure exactly
[2014-10-10 12:15:50] dude-x: and will tolerate structural changes
[2014-10-10 12:15:59] CSWookie: I'm currently writing a framework to allow non-programmers to write the tests.
[2014-10-10 12:16:51] CSWookie: And, while I'll have specific things for certain common widgets (like a listedit, for example), I'll not want special keywords for every single thing.
[2014-10-10 12:17:33] CSWookie: Anyway, I'll go back to using xpath for links.
[2014-10-10 12:17:44] SwampDragons, leaving. (#selenium)
[2014-10-10 12:18:11] CSWookie: And possibly modify my framework to use JavaScript to run xpaths, if I determine that that is my problem.
[2014-10-10 12:19:13] jimevans: CSWookie: hang on. which is not performing properly, finding by xpath or finding by link text?
[2014-10-10 12:20:17] dude-x: i think the complaint was using link text is slow
[2014-10-10 12:23:34] CSWookie: Both are slow.
[2014-10-10 12:23:56] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2014-10-10 12:24:27] CSWookie: XPath is slow when I'm trying to find tables and rows.  I suspect it's becasue I'm doing string operations.
[2014-10-10 12:25:09] jimevans: actually, xpath *should* pretty much just devolve down to document.evaluate() for browsers that support it natively.
[2014-10-10 12:25:14] CSWookie: jimevans: But the same xpaths are nice and snappy when I run it from the developer console, so I'm considering writing some JavaScript to run them there.
[2014-10-10 12:25:40] CSWookie: Firefox 15 is the browser I'm using.
[2014-10-10 12:25:55] CSWookie: On Windows 7
[2014-10-10 12:26:14] jimevans: what i'm trying to point out is that there should be comparatively little difference between browser developer console and webdriver's find by xpath.
[2014-10-10 12:26:19] jimevans: oof. that's ancient.
[2014-10-10 12:27:35] jimevans: so if you have specific examples of xpath that are poorly performing vs. running document.evaluate() in the developer console (with an appropriate test page, of course), i'm sure we'd be interested in seeing them.
[2014-10-10 12:30:35] CSWookie: I'll see about saving out the page, then, because it's consistently taking me 22+ seconds to run via selenium.
[2014-10-10 12:30:50] CSWookie: 20+ seconds rather

[2014-10-10 15:40:03] *lukeis hoping that one is the ExpectedConditions'
[2014-10-10 15:40:03] pollo-choke-o: a call to a function that returns like so: new WebDriverWait(driver, timeOutInSeconds)

[2014-10-10 15:45:54] pollo-choke-o: i don't think so lol

[2014-10-10 16:25:28] pollo-choke-o: i'm not trying to automate German
[2014-10-10 16:25:38] pollo-choke-o: i don't know why internationalization was brought in
[2014-10-10 16:26:16] AutomatedTester: because relying on text is going to make flakey tests
[2014-10-10 16:26:26] pollo-choke-o: if you consider internationalization
[2014-10-10 16:26:29] pollo-choke-o: which is not a consideration.

[2014-10-10 16:26:57] pollo-choke-o: and if it's so unstable, why is it even available to use
[2014-10-10 16:27:58] AutomatedTester: for the people who can't convince their development team to make their site automatable
[2014-10-10 16:28:16] pollo-choke-o: blaming people is worse than blaming tools imho
[2014-10-10 16:28:35] pollo-choke-o: i don't want to get fired
[2014-10-10 16:29:02] pollo-choke-o: well. looks like there's no solution. will mark as "Not automated"
[2014-10-10 16:29:10] pollo-choke-o: more excell sheet maintenance
[2014-10-10 16:33:41] pollo-choke-o: "making your site automatable" is equivalent to "work on this ie6 bug" in terms of level of annoyance
[2014-10-10 16:34:27] pollo-choke-o: spending extra complexity to make QA's job marginally easier is not a good goal
[2014-10-10 16:34:29] AutomatedTester: hey... your company clearly has money to burn... do what you need to
[2014-10-10 16:34:36] lukeis: funny, i got into test automation (away from UI development) because the problem is actually harder to solve :)
[2014-10-10 16:35:15] pollo-choke-o: it's not my job to sell selenium
[2014-10-10 16:35:35] pollo-choke-o: that is absolutely not my job
[2014-10-10 16:36:36] pollo-choke-o: test automation can be as impossibly hard as you want it to be.
[2014-10-10 16:37:02] pollo-choke-o: "automate the recognition of images and create 3d models automatically" this is impossible.
[2014-10-10 16:37:18] pollo-choke-o: this is like any job you may have in life
[2014-10-10 16:37:33] AutomatedTester: actually... browser vendors do that automation all the time
[2014-10-10 16:38:01] pollo-choke-o: i think you're thinking of something else.  browsers do ocr ?

[2014-10-10 16:39:51] AutomatedTester: if css can do something there needs to be a test to prove it
[2014-10-10 16:43:34] pollo-choke-o: hee hee. there is one. it's in an excell sheet
[2014-10-10 16:44:26] AutomatedTester: unfortunately we cant do that, doesnt help prove interop between browser vendors when we need pixel perfect rendering
[2014-10-10 16:44:30] pollo-choke-o: some thoughworks consultants @ 250$/hour recommended not testing css automatically in cases like color changes, width/height of things and other non functional presentational changes
[2014-10-10 16:44:41] pollo-choke-o: one of our developers is color blind anyways
