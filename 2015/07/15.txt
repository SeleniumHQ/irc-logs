[2015-07-15 05:08:14] yalu: I'm struggling with the selenium RC plugin in Jenkins. it sometimes schedules tests on the wrong host; and wether of not I cross the box "create selenium RC instance" in my project configuration, this doesn't seem to make a difference. A process is created that listens on port 4444, I tried setting the port to 5678 to see if I wasn't mixing up the sleenium processes, this makes no difference to anything as far as I can see

[2015-07-15 07:02:55] PCatinean: neil_b4_zod, hi! I have a web framework that loads a looot of data through ajax longpolling, the best way to wait for that is to use the WebDriverWait?
[2015-07-15 07:03:06] PCatinean: there's no, until all data is loaded method? I assume
[2015-07-15 07:04:23] rananda, quitting. (Quit: Leaving)
[2015-07-15 07:04:32] neil_b4_zod: no -- in my experience those waits are tough...is this an angular app by chance?  if so you can always try protractor...
[2015-07-15 07:05:22] neil_b4_zod: otherwise there's a library called pytractor that shows some promise though it hasn't been contributed to in a year.
[2015-07-15 07:06:24] PCatinean: tough in what sense neil_b4_zod ?
[2015-07-15 07:06:38] PCatinean: The framework is called Odoo and it's a web-client based ERP system written in python
[2015-07-15 07:06:48] PCatinean: And i'm trying to make some frontend tests for it
[2015-07-15 07:07:04] Dave_B_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 07:08:32] neil_b4_zod: gotcha...just tough in the sense that if there is a lot of data it can be difficult to get all the waits to work...no impossible though
[2015-07-15 07:09:37] neil_b4_zod: TL;DR: WebDriverWait is the correct approach.

[2015-07-15 09:50:53] jimevans: lukeis: i added the additional one, yes. if you want to go back and refactor, that's fine, but you absolutely *cannot* remove the method that sets the credentials without triggering an implicit 'ok'
[2015-07-15 09:51:40] lukeis: alright ;)
[2015-07-15 09:51:52] lukeis: will let the python one be though ;)
[2015-07-15 09:51:58] jimevans: because the semantics of the wire protocol end point are 'set the credentials only', and thus have to expose that, and only that, functionality via remote.
[2015-07-15 09:52:22] lukeis: ah, yeah
[2015-07-15 09:52:52] lukeis: silly grid and it's MITMing all requests
[2015-07-15 09:53:19] jimevans: now, if that changes the calculus about the user-facing local end API doing an implicit accept(), then so be it.
[2015-07-15 09:55:54] jimevans: and now we'll find out if that change actually worked. :)
[2015-07-15 09:59:31] jimevans: hey, i just realized something. once the next firefox esr comes out, we'll have no further need for firefox native events code.

[2015-07-15 10:45:33] jimevans: strixUK: might be a better way than that. you want the cookies set before you launch the browser for the first tiem?
[2015-07-15 10:45:36] jimevans: or time even?
[2015-07-15 10:46:29] strixUK: correct, and every time the selenium script runs, those cookies will get updated, and those need to persist into the next invocation of the selenium script
[2015-07-15 10:47:21] jimevans: i'm not entirely sure i understand the use case.

[2015-07-15 10:47:44] strixUK: (i'm trying to automate download of bank account export data, so without the (current) magic cookies, the bank thinks that this is a new client, something funny is going on and generally bounces you to manual verification)
[2015-07-15 10:48:22] strixUK: (sigh: paypal provide an API for this sort of thing; this bank doesn't.)
[2015-07-15 10:48:37] strixUK: (and i don't know of many that do, not that i've looked widely)
[2015-07-15 10:49:24] jimevans: are you able to know the values you require for the cookies a priori?
[2015-07-15 10:49:47] errant_rider: jimevans: i'm gonna be in ur hood in 2 weeks…wanna do dinner?
[2015-07-15 10:50:00] jimevans: if so, it should be relatively easy to navigate to the domain in question (without logging in, mind), set the appropriate cookie, and go from there.
[2015-07-15 10:50:26] jimevans: errant_rider: if we're available, yeah, that'd be teh awesumz.
[2015-07-15 10:50:47] errant_rider: last week of July…check ur schedule

[2015-07-15 10:51:13] jimevans: i'll let you know.
[2015-07-15 10:52:17] strixUK: the first time this ff profile connects, it is necessary to manually verify that it is a legit client/user, generally by email or SMS of a confirmation code.  so, i will do that manually using ff interactively; thereafter, the cookies (which, as I say, get updated in every session) need to persist with their new values.  hence the need to get selenium to use the source profile, not make a copy of it.
[2015-07-15 10:52:42] Neo--, quitting. (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
[2015-07-15 10:52:55] strixUK: so in short, no, i can't know the cookies a priori, although i suppose i could extract the cookies before the session ends, save them somewhere, then load them into the new profile next invocation.
[2015-07-15 10:53:03] kyoob: i don't know from python, but if i needed to persist a cooke using webdriver in java, i typically store it using some other java library, then when i've spun up a new webdriver object, i pass the cookie back to that
[2015-07-15 10:53:32] kyoob: if you're using two separate webdriver instances and want one cookie to be in both, you'll need to work outside of webdriver itself to store the cookie
[2015-07-15 10:53:49] strixUK: if they were static between invocations, that'd be fine.  AIUI, there are two persistent cookies.  one changes, the other doesn't.
[2015-07-15 10:54:38] kyoob: why do you need to persist a cookie that changes?

[2015-07-15 10:54:56] strixUK: (I can't actually see any differences between the manual and scripted auth requests, so i guess the js is doing something i can't see.)
[2015-07-15 10:56:20] strixUK: kyoob: because the bank changes at least one of the auth cookies every session.  i don't need cookies in concurrent invocations, only serial.  there will only ever be one of these running at a time, so pointing ff at the source profile should be okay.

[2015-07-15 11:13:47] strixUK: kyoob: np.  fwiw, firefox keeps history, cache, user prefs, cookies and more in a profile.  one user (or one machine) can have multiple different profiles if you wish.
[2015-07-15 11:14:22] strixUK: normally, selenium creates a brand new, empty profile from scratch, but you can have selenium use an existing profile.
[2015-07-15 11:14:28] dude-x, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 11:14:50] strixUK: the problem i've got is that selenium makes a copy of the profile and points ff at the copy, which means no changes in one session persist into the next.

[2015-07-15 11:34:29] strixUK: eh.. that would probably work, but it'd be simpler if it were possible to get selenium not to copy the profile in the first place
[2015-07-15 11:34:46] strixUK: another alternative is to copy cookies.sqlite, but that's probably risky for a variety of reasons.
[2015-07-15 11:35:19] jimevans: strixUK: i think you'll find remarkable resistance to allowing you to use the existing profile in situ from the webdriver project.
[2015-07-15 11:35:30] jimevans: but there *is* a decent reason for it.
[2015-07-15 11:35:39] jimevans: consider the multiple-instance case.
[2015-07-15 11:36:00] jimevans: it would be madness to try to invoke multiple instances of firefox pointing to the same physical profile.
[2015-07-15 11:36:29] strixUK: of course
[2015-07-15 11:36:38] strixUK: do you mean resistence from selenium itself, or from its devs? :)
[2015-07-15 11:36:58] strixUK: it depends on what you're trying to achieve.  not using copies is an extraordinarily bad idea in any regression-testing environment, or where there exists any potential for more than one instance of ff to be executed at any one time, but that's not what i'm doing.
[2015-07-15 11:37:46] strixUK: saving cookies at the end of the session and reinserting them could potentially be dangerous as well, since you have a similar race condition for whereever it is that you store the cookies after the session is over
[2015-07-15 11:37:59] strixUK: (although, admittedly there's less to go wrong there if done properly)
[2015-07-15 11:38:10] jimevans: strixUK: as long as you recognize that your case is an edge case
[2015-07-15 11:38:40] strixUK: for sure.  selenium is (AIUI) primarily a regression testing tool, but i'm coöpting it for other purposes
[2015-07-15 11:39:07] strixUK: (automating the fetching of bank export data, 'cos this bank has no API.)
[2015-07-15 11:39:08] jimevans: mmm, no, i'd not agree with that statement, but okay.
[2015-07-15 11:39:12] *lukeis pulls hair, looks wild eyed, channels danielwh… IT'S ALL BLOODY EDGE CASES'
[2015-07-15 11:39:23] jimevans: :)
[2015-07-15 11:39:35] strixUK: well, as i said, that's as i understand it.  i'm a complete n00b to selenium.
[2015-07-15 11:40:03] lukeis: hi n00b… we were all there before ;)
[2015-07-15 11:40:11] strixUK: heh, yep.  gotta start from somewhere.
[2015-07-15 11:40:17] kyoob: my handle is just noob misspelled
[2015-07-15 11:40:42] strixUK: believe it or not, i tried to automate this with python requests.  even though i preserved cookies between calls, i couldn't get the jolly thing to auth.  i guess too much js.
[2015-07-15 11:40:52] strixUK: so selenium seems to be a fairly painless alternative.
[2015-07-15 11:40:57] strixUK: and likely a more robust one.
[2015-07-15 11:41:13] kyoob: although "fetching of bank export data" does sound like it could be sort of a nefarious way to use selenium :)
[2015-07-15 11:41:29] strixUK: so, this being python, i think what i'll do is derive a new class of FirefoxProfile and change its __init__ behaviour.  yay for copy-and-paste bit-rot.

[2015-07-15 14:00:21] Testomatic: ok
[2015-07-15 14:00:48] jimevans: you have a machine. on that machine you have protected mode settings set to the same value for all zones, right?
[2015-07-15 14:00:48] sbonebrake, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 14:00:57] Testomatic: yes
[2015-07-15 14:01:39] jimevans: when that machine is used to execute the webdriver code using the IE driver locally (in other words you use "new InternetExplorerDriver()") everything works fine, right?
[2015-07-15 14:01:47] Testomatic: yes
[2015-07-15 14:02:45] jimevans: also on the same machine, when you execute the webdriver code using the RemoteWebDriver (not using grid, per se, just the standalone server running on the same box), you run into errors, is that correct?
[2015-07-15 14:03:14] Testomatic: no
[2015-07-15 14:03:29] Testomatic: I am using the grid
[2015-07-15 14:03:29] jimevans: okay, so it works in that instance.
[2015-07-15 14:03:48] jimevans: my point is that if you haven't tried that scenario, you ought to.
[2015-07-15 14:03:52] jimevans: it would provide more data

[2015-07-15 14:19:21] jimevans: Testomatic: frequently, people assume that once they configure stuff for running locally, they can just fire up a grid, point tests at it, and that everything will work just fine.
[2015-07-15 14:19:32] jimevans: this is clearly not the case.
[2015-07-15 14:19:46] Testomatic: jimevans: clearly, but the tests work fine running remote with chrome and safari
[2015-07-15 14:19:46] jimevans: every node must be configured as if it were going to run webdriver code locally

[2015-07-15 14:20:51] jimevans: i couldn't possibly be able to say. i don't know how the node is configured.
[2015-07-15 14:21:01] Testomatic: I'm pretty clear I'm doing something wrong or missing something here but I've been slamming my head into this trying to figure it out for 2 weeks. Haven't gotten even one step closer to making it work
[2015-07-15 14:21:16] Testomatic: I'm just using the standard json, copied straight from the example page
[2015-07-15 14:21:40] Testomatic: we don't configure the standalone server we use to run tests locally
[2015-07-15 14:22:15] jimevans: you configure the browser though, right?
[2015-07-15 14:22:31] Testomatic: hm?
[2015-07-15 14:22:36] Testomatic: in the test we do
[2015-07-15 14:22:38] jimevans: and how, when running locally, do you tell the standalone server where the executables are?
[2015-07-15 14:23:01] jimevans: um, not for IE, you don't configure the browser, unless you're doing something outside of webdriver to do so.
[2015-07-15 14:23:20] Testomatic: I was going to say I didn't think we were configuring anything
[2015-07-15 14:23:25] jimevans: the IE driver has no facility whatsoever for *setting* the protected mode properties.
[2015-07-15 14:23:32] Testomatic: but I don't actually get to see the insides of the tests themselves, I just get to set up the grid.
[2015-07-15 14:23:49] jimevans: i think we're talking past each other a little.
[2015-07-15 14:24:09] Testomatic: wait what? of course it doesn't have that facility
[2015-07-15 14:24:15] Testomatic: the browsers are configured already
[2015-07-15 14:24:31] Testomatic: I have to go in and make sure everything is at 100% zoom and protected mode is on in all zones
[2015-07-15 14:25:08] Testomatic: and then it's just launch the standalone server and throw tests at it
[2015-07-15 14:25:34] bbarke, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 14:25:38] jimevans: how do you launch the standalone server? in other words, what do you use on the command line?
[2015-07-15 14:25:58] Testomatic: java -jar selenium-standalone-server-2.42-2.jar
[2015-07-15 14:26:19] Testomatic: AHA that's what I screwed up
[2015-07-15 14:26:36] Testomatic: I didn't point the drivers when I did the remote, that still doesn't make sense for the grid though
[2015-07-15 14:26:43] Testomatic: because I wrote a batch file that does all that for me
[2015-07-15 14:26:45] jimevans: so you're not telling the standalone server where to find the driver executables.
[2015-07-15 14:26:53] Testomatic: just this one instance
[2015-07-15 14:26:57] Testomatic: let me try that and see what error I get

[2015-07-15 14:29:23] lukeis: there's a long feedback loop on changes in the firefox driver :-/
[2015-07-15 14:29:33] Testomatic: but still not when I run not using remote :/
[2015-07-15 14:31:48] jimevans: Testomatic: so my question is this - is it the very act of using RemoteWebDriver, or something else that may be causing the issue? one easy way to do that is to run locally, but use RemoteWebDriver connected to a standalone server instance running on the same machine.
[2015-07-15 14:34:02] jimevans: Testomatic: also, how are you confirming that the protected mode settings are the same for all zones? remote desktop connection?
[2015-07-15 14:34:05] Testomatic: jimevans: I just did that and reproduced the protected mode issue
[2015-07-15 14:34:14] Testomatic: jimevans it's this machine that I'm on right now
[2015-07-15 14:34:56] jimevans: and it works when you use the IE driver directly. interesting. same logged in user (not different desktops), i assume.
[2015-07-15 14:35:05] Testomatic: yea
[2015-07-15 14:35:11] jimevans: and you're using the java language bindings on the local end
[2015-07-15 14:35:45] Testomatic: now you're talking a bit beyond me, what are you referring to?
[2015-07-15 14:35:46] jimevans: (not that it should matter)
[2015-07-15 14:35:55] Testomatic: I'm sure I've done it but which java language bindings
[2015-07-15 14:35:59] jimevans: your webdriver code. what language is it written in?
[2015-07-15 14:36:04] Bootinbull, quitting. (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
[2015-07-15 14:36:05] Testomatic: oh, it's in C#
[2015-07-15 14:36:11] jimevans: okay.
[2015-07-15 14:36:20] Testomatic: now your statement makes more sense
[2015-07-15 14:37:07] jimevans: so you're using the .NET language bindings to talk to a standalone server for running IE tests, and that's failing.
[2015-07-15 14:37:13] Testomatic: it has to be some weird setting my corporation has on our machines, but I can verify that protected mode is the same all the way through and I'm still getting that error
[2015-07-15 14:37:39] Testomatic: the exact error it's reporting is : Unexpected error launching Internet Explorer. Protected Mode settings are not the same for all zones. Enable Protected Mode must be set to the same value (enabled or disabled) for all zones. (WARNING: The server did not provide any stacktrace information)
[2015-07-15 14:37:53] jimevans: so when you say you're successfully running locally, that means you're doing something like "IWebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();" right?
[2015-07-15 14:38:13] Testomatic: yea
[2015-07-15 14:38:50] jimevans: okay, can you show me some sample code of how you work locally vs how you change the code to run remotely? use :gist or similar
[2015-07-15 14:39:06] jimevans: i have some ideas, but i need to see how your code looks.
[2015-07-15 14:39:08] Bootinbull, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 14:40:32] jimevans: because all IEDriverServer.exe does is check certain registry locations to see how the protected mode settings are set for each of the four zones, and if they're not the same value, it returns the error.
[2015-07-15 14:40:40] jimevans: that's all it's doing is a registry check.
[2015-07-15 14:42:04] Padawan, quitting. (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
[2015-07-15 14:42:21] Testomatic: that gives me an idea, I'll check my registry then remote into my machine and check it, that could be the issue due to my corporate policy group settings
[2015-07-15 14:43:16] jimevans: but if you can reproduce it simply by using RemoteWebDriver on the same machine, you don't need to do that.
[2015-07-15 14:44:20] gabecase, quitting. (Remote host closed the connection)
[2015-07-15 14:44:20] Padawan, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 14:44:34] jimevans: (assuming your code looks something like 'IWebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new Uri("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), capabilities);' where 'capabilities' is an appropriately created ICapabilities object.)
[2015-07-15 14:45:36] jimevans: but the creation of that "capabilities" object is critical to helping understand why this may or may not be happening. and the actual syntax of your creation of the InternetExplorerDriver object in the local case is important to understand that too.
[2015-07-15 14:45:53] Testomatic: found and fixed it
[2015-07-15 14:46:02] jimevans: what was the issue?
[2015-07-15 14:46:04] Testomatic: one of the registry keys was different than the other ones
[2015-07-15 14:46:17] Testomatic: but if I look in the actual browser protected mode settings were on for everything
[2015-07-15 14:46:34] Testomatic: I just saw a stack overflow that said they had to all be the same at 2500 under ie
[2015-07-15 14:46:54] Testomatic: I don't actually know what that value means though, so here's to hoping I don't get fired for it
[2015-07-15 14:47:03] jimevans: well, now, be careful. there's one zone that doesn't appear in the UI
[2015-07-15 14:47:19] jimevans: it's the "My Computer" zone, and the driver ignores that one.
[2015-07-15 14:47:33] jimevans: i think it's zone 0, if memory serves
[2015-07-15 14:47:38] Testomatic: what are the other zones?
[2015-07-15 14:47:47] Testomatic: I think it was zone 2 that was set to 3 instead of 0
[2015-07-15 14:49:10] jimevans: trusted sites is zone 2
[2015-07-15 14:49:46] gabecase, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-07-15 14:49:59] jimevans: turning protected mode "on" should result in a registry value of '0', if memory serves.
