[2015-04-23 09:30:46] eindoofus_: so i'm manually creating a java application that wraps an HttpClient and passes it Request objects to get info from the api. My end goal is to retrieve/parse the api response so I can compare it against Selenium tests. However, a tester on an unrelated project told me something like this may exist for the Spring MVC framework already (which is what the site is using). Is this the case? If so, what is it called?
[2015-04-23 09:32:04] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus_: selenium does not allow you to inspect/test against http response/request objects
[2015-04-23 09:32:09] WhereIsMySpoon: and is not for that sort of thing
[2015-04-23 09:32:53] eindoofus_: WhereIsMySpoon, I should add I'm creating my own objects to store the parsed json responses. I'll be using those to compare against.
[2015-04-23 09:33:24] WhereIsMySpoon: this is really not anything that selenium is useful for
[2015-04-23 09:34:06] eindoofus_: sorry, getting desperate. asked the question in #java and #spring, and no responses. don't want to continue down the wrong path, if it is in fact the wrong path
[2015-04-23 09:34:50] WhereIsMySpoon: eindoofus_: spring does allow you do inspect request/response objects

[2015-04-23 09:38:34] jleyba_, joining. (#selenium)
[2015-04-23 09:38:42] WhereIsMySpoon: and those request and response objects will be populated by spring
[2015-04-23 09:38:49] WhereIsMySpoon: and you can manipulate them
[2015-04-23 09:40:35] eindoofus_: so you would pass the params in the @RequestMapping.. but what about parsing the response? or specify get/post, or including an authentication key/value in the header (need one in my case)
[2015-04-23 09:41:32] sircapsalot: you should probably do a spring tutorial.. i'm not sure WhereIsMySpoon has the time to do all the hand-holding
[2015-04-23 09:43:02] eindoofus_: sircapsalot, i guess i don't expect hand-holding, just need to know whether it can do all of that before i go down a different route. already spent a bit of time on my custom solution.

[2015-04-23 13:11:48] jimevans: cweng: what do you mean by "security levels the same?" the only security setting that you should ever need to touch for the IE driver is the Protected Mode setting. you shouldn't have to change any other setting on the security tab of the options dialog.
[2015-04-23 13:12:04] cweng: yeah the protected mode setting
[2015-04-23 13:12:30] jimevans: okay, so back to my initial question: define "lose connection"

[2015-04-23 13:13:29] jimevans: the most common cause of the driver "losing connection" to the browser instance is crossing a protected mode boundary
[2015-04-23 13:14:29] cweng: The node will launch an instance of the browser, but then it won't be able to find any of the elements on the browser

[2015-04-23 13:15:05] cweng: The driver won't see the browser anymore even if its still open
[2015-04-23 13:16:30] jimevans: okay, so i'm trying to nail down *exactly* what state the driver is in, and i think our terms are a little imprecise.
[2015-04-23 13:16:56] jimevans: there's a difference between "can't find elements" and "doesn't see or communicate with the browser instance." which is it?
[2015-04-23 13:17:36] cweng: the second one
[2015-04-23 13:18:54] jimevans: and how do you know that's the case? (please note that you've not provided any code or exception stack traces or log file contents, so please understand why i have to ask)
[2015-04-23 13:19:53] jimevans: furthermore, there's a difference between "the hub loses communication with the node" and "iedriverserver.exe loses communication with the browser instance"
[2015-04-23 13:24:30] cweng: On my commandprompt for the node. it throws an exception: unable to find element on closed window when the window is still open
[2015-04-23 13:24:49] cweng: (server did not provide any stacktrace information)
[2015-04-23 13:29:20] jimevans: and if you enable logging for iedriverserver.exe, what does the log show?
[2015-04-23 13:30:10] jimevans: because honestly it sounds remarkably like you're crossing a protected mode boundary
