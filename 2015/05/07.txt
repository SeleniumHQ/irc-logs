[2015-05-07 08:47:38] inad922: On a remote webdriver how can I set the language preference?
[2015-05-07 08:48:09] inad922: I mean I know it's possible with the Firefox driver or when the remote runs against a Firefox browser, but is it possible in other cases?
[2015-05-07 08:50:50] lukeis1: inad922: it's specific per browser (and I'm not sure how to do it for the likes of IE or Safari)
[2015-05-07 08:50:58] lukeis1, changing nick to lukeis.
[2015-05-07 08:51:15] lukeis: for example, a quick google results in this for chrome:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18645205/set-chromes-language-using-selenium-chromedriver

[2015-05-07 12:04:05] barancev: lukeis: can it be that selenium on linux is totally broken?

[2015-05-07 12:14:27] ColinSauce: is it erroring?
[2015-05-07 12:14:35] ColinSauce: sounds like it's not finding the elements by those IDs if tehy aren't getting filed
[2015-05-07 12:14:39] ColinSauce: does user_id have contents?
[2015-05-07 12:17:34] Henry151: well, this script was supposed to put contents into user_id. but it's not doing so.
[2015-05-07 12:18:53] Henry151: if I run it exactly as shown, with the little placeholders instead of the actual credentials, it populates the dealer id field with "mydlrid", but fails to populate the user id field with "myusid"

[2015-05-07 13:29:47] AutomatedTester: barancev: we don't use -silent on our test infra so hopefully the cause of us using it in the past has been fixed
[2015-05-07 13:30:51] barancev: what should we change the selenium code to avoid using this option?

[2015-05-07 13:49:00] Henry151: now i've found out that i can do the stuff in the selenium ide, recording my actions, and then export it to python
[2015-05-07 13:49:04] barancev: AutomatedTester: but you did not answer the question :)
[2015-05-07 13:49:27] barancev: what if we skip this 'clean' step?
[2015-05-07 13:49:43] Henry151: so i want to know--i've made a python script now that successfully selects the right radio button and clicks download
[2015-05-07 13:49:59] Henry151: but then a download dialog box pops up, asking whether i want to save the file or open it
[2015-05-07 13:50:04] AutomatedTester: barancev: it shouldnt matter if we skip it
[2015-05-07 13:50:19] Henry151: how do i click the save button from within selenium?

[2015-05-07 13:52:23] barancev: that were upset by "incomplete profile"
[2015-05-07 13:55:03] barancev: lukeis: can you try to run some tests (e.g. javascript ones) on linux?
[2015-05-07 13:55:19] lukeis: i don't have a linux box handy
[2015-05-07 13:55:23] barancev: :(
[2015-05-07 13:55:42] barancev: there is a chance selenium is totally broken on linux
[2015-05-07 13:55:46] lukeis: you could use our docker images :)
[2015-05-07 13:55:46] barancev: or sauce is :)
[2015-05-07 13:56:05] kyoob: Henry151 since that dialog box is not within the page document, you'll probably have to use some other python tool to manipulate it
[2015-05-07 13:56:55] barancev: first I need to learn to use docker then :)
[2015-05-07 13:57:12] kyoob: if you're committed to ff, you can set your firefox profile to automatically download to some directory without confirming
[2015-05-07 13:57:19] barancev: on windows, I mean
[2015-05-07 13:57:39] barancev: I heard it is not easy

[2015-05-07 20:27:05] onlywade: well, for one thing it appears that you're not passing the profile into the webdriver.Firefox() constructor. without that, your profile settings will not take effect.
[2015-05-07 20:27:40] onlywade: if the browser is failing to launch at all, you should share more details about what happens, any error messages, etc..
