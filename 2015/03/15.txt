[2015-03-15 09:22:55] ato: Yes it will.
[2015-03-15 09:23:16] Ankit: But it is not working.
[2015-03-15 09:23:30] Ankit: Its not even launching safari browser
[2015-03-15 09:23:44] Ankit: How to do that, please help......
[2015-03-15 09:24:00] ato: I think automatic installation of the SafariDriver extension was disabled in the last release
[2015-03-15 09:24:02] ato: .
[2015-03-15 09:24:08] ato: So you'll likely have to install it manually.
[2015-03-15 09:24:34] Ankit: Ya, that I installed, but still the browser is not launching...
[2015-03-15 09:24:58] ato: I don't really know Safari, but have you looked at the wiki? https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/SafariDriver
[2015-03-15 09:25:37] Ankit: No, this I didn't look at. Please, wait.... I will go through it.
[2015-03-15 09:28:30] Ankit: Actually, it is also saying to install the driver extension and simply launching safari.
[2015-03-15 09:28:41] Ankit: This I have already tried. But not working.
[2015-03-15 09:29:03] Ankit: Is it something like, selenium works for only some versions of safarai?

[2015-03-15 11:42:35] daemon: mind bendingly so
[2015-03-15 11:42:56] ato: It's because of a regression in httpd.js.
[2015-03-15 11:43:06] ato: There's an unvetted patch for it.
[2015-03-15 11:43:22] daemon: I moved from freebsd/firefox to windows7/chrome, I wonder if freebsd/chromium would be as quick
[2015-03-15 11:43:55] ato: There would probably not be much of a difference.

[2015-03-15 11:44:32] ato: WebDriver against Chromium on FreeBSD.
[2015-03-15 11:45:07] daemon: ah
[2015-03-15 11:45:08] ato: But as I said, FirefoxDriver has a known issue with a recent upgrade of httpd.js.
[2015-03-15 11:45:23] daemon: Yeah its a real pita when you cannot catch errors
[2015-03-15 11:45:27] daemon: and it randomly generates them
[2015-03-15 11:46:05] daemon: I should probably see how phantomjs sits, just for completeness
[2015-03-15 11:46:47] ato: PhantomJS is basically the old Chromium, so shouldn't be much of a difference either.
[2015-03-15 11:49:46] daemon: ato I am using virtual machines as deployment targets, so less rendering, less cpu overhead
[2015-03-15 11:51:18] ato: Right, that may be the case.

My existing tests, several months old (not sure exactly which versions of webdriver and FF) are not working anymore. Firefox starts, but navigating to an URL doesn't work.
[2015-03-15 11:57:13] morkeleb: Both installed today, by the way (Selenium and FF).
[2015-03-15 11:58:57] barancev: morkeleb: I bet you're using an older version of Selenium
[2015-03-15 11:59:28] barancev: ato: chrome is faster anyway
[2015-03-15 12:00:55] ato: barancev: I think what was being referred to was the fact that it's currently very slow.
[2015-03-15 12:01:04] ato: barancev: Moreso than usual.
[2015-03-15 12:04:26] morkeleb: barancev: Ok? I looked at the properties of the Webdriver reference (installed with NuGet), and it says 2.45.0.0.

[2015-03-15 12:15:42] morkeleb: Hm...couldn't find any. But, digging a bit it might seem that the problem is not with the selenium installation - which would be great. I'll get back and nag a bit more if I cannot figure it out. Thanks for the help :-)
