[00:05:02] santiycr: alright, I'll release the vms with firefox 12 and 13 installed in them
[00:05:11] santiycr: we'll investigate why they don't work with Se once they are live
[00:06:07] AutomatedTester: santiycr: 12 should work with 2.22
[00:06:26] AutomatedTester: and native events work with 2.23 and Firefox 13
[00:06:47] santiycr: hm, in my vm, the browsers don't even launch
[00:07:46] *santiycr loves when a 2 hour long task becomes a 8 hour long task
[00:09:03] santiycr: oh, this could be my fault
[00:09:32] santiycr: I may be testing on an old vm that doesn't have firefox 12 and 13
[00:10:15] AutomatedTester: dawagner: 2863 was broken in the first version of Firefox 8 that worked with WebDriver
[00:10:43] AutomatedTester: bad news was that was b6
[00:11:06] dawagner: IIRC I had a minimum reproducable extension in my doc
[00:11:26] dawagner: http://illicitonion.com/2863/crossdomainframe.xpi would let you bisect beyond when selenium worked
[00:11:44] AutomatedTester: what am I supposed to do with the addon?
[00:11:53] AutomatedTester: just load it?
[00:12:16] dawagner: sec, I need to remind myself
[00:13:32] dawagner: Open it and click the firefox icon bottom-right
[00:14:40] AutomatedTester: dawagner: its not compatible, mind rebuilding quickly and updating the install.rdf to have a min ver of 7?
[00:16:22] dawagner: Balls, new-style extensions don't work before 10
[00:16:31] AutomatedTester: the do
[00:16:38] AutomatedTester: they should work from 4 onwards

[00:21:35] *dawagner needs to find where he made the extension...
[00:22:12] dawagner: Ooh! Found it, I think!
[00:28:06] dawagner: AutomatedTester: Any idea how I set the minimum version in a jetpack extension?
[00:30:29] santiycr: alright! 2.22.0 works with FF12 in both RC and WD
[00:30:59] santiycr: none of them work with FF13, but I'm guessing you guys are on it 
[00:31:00] santiycr: :)
[00:31:14] dawagner: 2.23.0 shoud work with FF13
[00:31:34] *santiycr putting both FF12 and FF13 in prod so that we can get the CI running
[00:31:41] dawagner: yay! Thanks!
[00:31:44] santiycr: man, this 6 week release cycle is killing me 
[00:31:46] santiycr: :)
[00:35:05] AutomatedTester: dawagner: I cheated and just opened the zippy
[00:35:26] AutomatedTester: dawagner: should it show Some content?
[00:36:13] dawagner: Open up the error console
[00:36:37] dawagner: It should output "Name: [frame name]" if successful, or an error message if not
[00:36:45] dawagner: Just going to http://www.illicitonion.com/2863 should do the job
[00:37:08] dawagner: The error message it gives if it fails is "An error occurred while accessing the name of the frame."
[00:37:17] dawagner: If it says anything else, something has gone wrong somewhere
[00:37:23] AutomatedTester: info: An error occurred while accessing the name of the frame. 
[00:37:25] AutomatedTester: ?
[00:37:38] dawagner: Yep, that means it suffers from the 2863 bug
[00:37:48] AutomatedTester: okie dokey
[00:41:32] AutomatedTester: dawagner: its not pushing log statements
[00:44:32] dawagner: I assume jetpack defaulted to a min version of 10 for a reason...
[00:45:44] AutomatedTester: dawagner: it was working a second ago
[00:46:07] dawagner: hmm
[00:46:13] dawagner: It pushes log statements on tab creation
[00:46:21] dawagner: So you need to actively open a tab
[00:48:17] AutomatedTester: hmm
[00:49:55] dawagner: Anywho, /me -> bed, ttyl :)

[02:40:10] MicronXD: Hi all!
[02:41:29] MicronXD: I'd like to start using Selenium in a project I'm working on, but I'm having trouble differentiating between the different parts of Selenium.
[02:42:10] MicronXD: I've installed Selenium 2, I've installed chromedriver.
[02:42:23] MicronXD: I've installed the Selenium Python API.
[02:45:35] MicronXD: Unfortunately, I'm not all that good at Python, so I was looking to use PHP or Javascript (running on Node.js).
[02:46:01] MicronXD: I'd prefer a Javascript API.
[02:46:42] MicronXD: I've found one called sodajs, unfortunately, everything I've read about it says it's for Selenium 1
[02:47:28] MicronXD: I also read that facebook created php bindings for the Selenium API.
[02:48:42] MicronXD: I don't have a great deal of understanding where these APIs end, where Selenium starts, where it ends, and where ChromeDriver starts.
[02:56:12] santiycr: well, there's a daisy chain of things happening when you run a selenium test
[02:56:32] santiycr: the easiest one is: selenium <-> browser
[02:56:44] santiycr: that's the case fore firefox tests, running with something like FirefoxDriver
[02:56:58] santiycr: when using chrome, selenium needs a server called ChromeDriver in the middle
[02:57:05] santiycr: so it's:
[02:57:18] santiycr: selenium <-> ChromeDriver <-> Chrome
[02:57:58] santiycr: if you are using RemoteWebDriver, means you want to run your tests in a remote machine, therefore the libraries being imported and used in your tests are going to hit a remote selenium server
[02:58:03] santiycr: then it looks something like this:
[02:58:21] santiycr: selenium-client <-> selenium-server <-> ChromeDriver <-> Chrome
[02:58:42] santiycr: most of this inter-process communication happens over HTTP

[03:00:28] santiycr: re php or python or js
[03:00:45] santiycr: you can use any of those, there's webdriver (se2) client libraries for all of them
[03:00:53] santiycr: for js, you may be missing wd:
[03:00:57] santiycr: https://github.com/admc/wd
[03:01:09] santiycr: which is nice as it's just installable via npm
[03:03:59] MicronXD: wow!
[03:04:06] MicronXD: thanks, santiycr:
[03:04:34] santiycr: anytime
[03:07:54] MicronXD: I'm gonna go with js.
[03:08:34] MicronXD: So everything works with Python right now.
[03:08:38] MicronXD: end-to-end
[03:10:13] MicronXD: to lop off the python end, and replace it with js on node, the only missing piece is wd?

[10:51:55] dawagner: Morning Maior :)
[10:52:10] Maior: dawagner: morning - didn't recognise you in the user list :P
[10:52:40] dawagner: So what offends you about page objects? :)
[10:52:48] Maior: "offends" is a strong word :P
[10:53:21] Maior: and maybe it's that I've not really seen good examples yet
[10:54:00] dawagner: Unfortunately it's the kind of thing where toy examples don't really show the benefits
[10:54:05] dawagner: The things that I like about them:
[10:54:09] Maior: yeah I'm getting that!
[10:54:34] dawagner: * Encourages you to think in terms of user flow, rather than library commands
[10:54:47] bsilwal has left #selenium
[10:54:55] dawagner: * Encourages you to push the library-specific logic in to a single place (the page objects), rather than sprinkled around the tests
[10:55:34] dawagner: * Allows for very swift and simple changes to tests, when there are massive UI overhalls, because your tests don't actually change; just an implementation detail of your page objects do
[10:56:11] dawagner: (I believe llaskin had an exciting "They changed the whole UI and my tests got updated with 10 lines of change in 15 minutes, how awesome is that?" moment recently, though I believe he's also asleep)
[10:56:16] Maior: hm
[10:56:56] dawagner: It's the same old programming ideas of: Keep to one level of abstraction per class/method, use domain language, and DRY
[10:57:19] dawagner: Note that if you're trying to use Selenium's built in page object support classes you're probably going to have a bad time
[10:58:14] Maior: aiui they don't exist for Python
[10:58:23] Maior: but, that's interesting to note... (why? hadn't looked at them)
[10:59:58] dawagner: There's a few things I don't like about their implementation; they're not very flexible (you inherit from an abstract class which hides its isLoaded method, for example, which is pretty annoying)
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Jun  8 11:00:25 2012]
[11:00:25] dawagner: They encourage naming of variables according to the ID or name of the element you're looking up, which is a pretty sucky leaking of an implementation detail
[11:00:58] dawagner: The @FindBy annotation is pretty inflexible, particularly if you want to do any kind of dynamic lookup (e.g. you don't know a row number at compile time or something)
[11:01:18] AutomatedTester: Maior: those classes dont exist in python because they arent idiomatic for python
[11:01:35] dawagner: In general, every time I've tried to use them, it's felt like I was making my code fit the library, which sucks :)
[11:01:43] AutomatedTester: Maior: but look what we are doing with my python for Addons.mozilla.org http://github.com/mozilla/addons-test

[11:08:22] krosenvold: Cool. I've been playing with websockets @DayJOb for the last week or so, and I cant help thinking how we could avoid 1000 problems with ffdriver if we switched to websockets
[11:09:12] krosenvold: websockets rule my world (this week)
[11:09:44] krosenvold: AutomatedTester: Is that a c++ reimplementation or is it based on the existing js ?
[11:09:50] Maior: AutomatedTester / dawagner - ok, cheers for the advice, I'll work at them a bit more and see how things go
[11:09:53] Maior: thanks
[11:10:14] dawagner: Good luck!
[11:11:00] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: its using the atoms atm 
[11:11:07] AutomatedTester: and then using JS we are building
[11:11:18] krosenvold: What does it do for webserver ?
[11:11:49] AutomatedTester: http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/testing/marionette
[11:11:56] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: it doesnt use a webserver
[11:12:07] AutomatedTester: its using the JS Remote Debugger protocol
[11:12:27] krosenvold: Excellent
[11:12:44] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: so you can telnet into the browser and control it that way if you want
[11:13:22] *krosenvold wants
[11:14:09] andreastt: krosenvold: Nothing in the spec that prevents us from implementing a WebDriver remote server on WebSockets. (-:
[11:14:39] krosenvold: andreastt: I suppose I'm a bit hung up on the current crappy way we start firefox
[11:14:49] krosenvold: Which looks like it's going away ;)
[11:15:44] andreastt: I wouldn't know anything about that.
[11:18:30] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: crappy way we start firefox?
[11:18:59] krosenvold: Yes, because we do all this stuff about determinining free ports, starting the browser and then trying to connect to it
[11:19:22] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: we will still need to do that
[11:19:34] krosenvold: With websockets we could invert the whole thing, send the address of the "server" to the extension and have the extension connect to the server
[11:20:03] krosenvold: Instead of various half-wicked polling/allocation schemes that only seem to fill our issue trackers
[11:20:03] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: we could...
[11:20:22] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: we need to tell marionette which port to listen on
[11:20:34] andreastt: krosenvold: You still need to determine which port to start the server on.
[11:21:05] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: but marionette removes the need for an extension
[11:21:05] krosenvold: AutomatedTester: Technically, with websockets the browser extension can be told WHERE to connect, so you could allocate a single port and ALL browser instances could connect to that
[11:21:27] AutomatedTester: actually you can add the extension but that would be pointless
[11:21:32] krosenvold: Which is cool
[11:21:52] krosenvold: Yes, I like marionette. Can't wiat
[11:21:54] krosenvold: wait
[11:22:04] AutomatedTester: we need it for mobile as well as desktop
[11:22:12] AutomatedTester: and B2G doesnt allow extensions
[11:22:23] krosenvold: But somehow you'll still need to determine what PORT the the debugger extensions are running  on
[11:22:35] krosenvold: And you can still have allocation race conditions around that port
[11:22:38] AutomatedTester: and the Mozilla App store creates chromeless browser apps which cant use extensions
[11:23:28] AutomatedTester: krosenvold: the ports it uses will be assigned by the client code
[11:23:56] krosenvold: Yes, but there's stuff like #3868
[11:23:58] selbot2: 03 open/accepted Detection of free EphemeralPort failure on Linux (debian wheezy) - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3868 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Status-Untriaged Component-WebDriver OpSys-Linux]
[11:24:13] krosenvold: Which is a REAL bugger
[11:24:35] krosenvold: It seems like debian wheezy has allocated more or less the ENTIRE port range as ephemeral ports
[11:25:03] krosenvold: Which means between the time we decide the port is "free" to use, and the time the browser has allocated it, someone else can/will steal the port
[11:25:40] krosenvold: We've been hit extremely hard by this when running close to server capacity on CI
[11:26:27] krosenvold: With websockets we could start a SINGLE process on a well known port (shared by all browsers) and have each browser connect to that port
[11:26:49] krosenvold: It's the hollywood principle

[11:55:58] Maior: so how do people cleanly implement things like "I have a page with a next button and a t&cs checkbox that must be checked" in a PageObjects-y way; I've got a sort of go_to_next() that takes a "do_I_agree", but in terms of returning a new PageObject
[11:57:33] Maior: I can inspect the state of the page after driver.stuff.click() and return the appropriate object, select page based on that parameter, assume success and end up raising some sort of Exception...

[12:05:01] Maior: oh wait, I just re-read that - "*expect*"?

[13:21:06] Swadq: Hey guys - my test uses a VPN proxy switcher. Sometimes, the proxy changes during a page load, and the page continues trying to load, without success. Is there any way I can make selenium try to load a page for 20 seconds, then retry? I'm using java, with a webdriverbackedselenium
[13:22:08] timholum: nevermind, I had to update java
[13:26:40] Swadq_ has joined #selenium
[13:28:17] skiphuffman: Swadq, about all you can do is set a timeout
[13:28:37] Swadq: just with selenium.setTimeout("20000") ?
[13:28:40] skiphuffman: for remote webdriver I think the attribute is "implicit_timeout"
[13:28:51] Swadq: Thanks, I'll do that
[13:28:59] Swadq: Will it throw an exception when it doesn't load, then?
[13:30:18] skiphuffman: it is .implicitly_wait
[13:30:22] Swadq_ has joined #selenium
[13:30:22] skiphuffman: and it is in seconds
[13:30:31] skiphuffman: Yes, it throws an exception.

[13:32:37] Swadq: skiphuffman ^^
[13:32:47] skiphuffman: sorry.  donuts
[13:33:18] skiphuffman: the attribute is .implicitly_wait

[13:33:36] skiphuffman: Well, if you are in Ravinia, come on by.
[13:33:56] skiphuffman: it does throw an exception.

[13:34:04] Swadq: how do I set an attribute, skiphuffman ?
[13:34:43] skiphuffman: I'm a python guy, so I do it after I create a connection like this:  connection = webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub", capability)
[13:35:02] skiphuffman: by doing this:  connection.implicitly_wait(10)

[13:39:40] Swadq: If it helps - by your guidance I've got my problem fixed in a giffy :)
[13:39:40] skiphuffman: All at 2.23.0 now
[13:39:49] Swadq: And that didn't help? :/
[13:39:50] skiphuffman: Ah excellent!
[13:40:00] skiphuffman: No, the update did nothing.
[13:40:32] Swadq: :/ have any of the experts had anything to say yet?
[13:40:57] skiphuffman: Their last suggestion was the update.  But I think they are flailing.
[13:41:14] Swadq: Sounds like it :/
[13:41:27] skiphuffman: This shouldn't be rocket surgery.
[13:41:34] Swadq: Why can't you run your tests from the first computer?
[13:43:22] skiphuffman: We have a continuous integration stack
[13:43:41] skiphuffman: I develop tests on my development machine.
[13:43:51] skiphuffman: Then load them into an svn
[13:44:28] skiphuffman: when the developers update their code, our build server builds it.
[13:44:36] skiphuffman: Then runs my tests
[13:44:41] skiphuffman: produces reports
[13:44:53] skiphuffman: and sends the code into a production ready repository.
[13:45:21] skiphuffman: So I need my tests to run on a test client that is attached to the build server.
[13:45:36] skiphuffman: This runs perfectly most of the time.
[13:45:46] skiphuffman: This is the first real problem that I have had with it.
[13:46:18] skiphuffman: Oh, and part of my test is to run the same portal process on different browsers, so I have a browser lab with different OS and Browser combinations.
[13:46:46] skiphuffman: The automated test set runs the same test on every environment we support.

[15:06:19] mydog2: morning guys..
[15:09:57] skiphuffman: It may be PART of the problem.  I am tracking something in my code now.
[15:10:27] mydog2: anyone use selenium to crawl/scrape/test static sites?
[15:10:50] alp82 has joined #selenium
[15:11:00] skiphuffman: mydog2, all sites have some static components.  What are you trying to do?
[15:13:21] opapo has joined #selenium
[15:13:35] mydog2: hey skiphuffman - i've used sel to test against dynamic sites.. and used py/curl/mechanize to do static sites. but it occurred to me that sel is an easier process and might be used to handle the static sites as well.. things like doing form handling/processing... in py/curl.. you have to deal with the form elems.. as well as the hidden data/etc.. whereas in sel.. it's a "select/click"
[15:14:19] mydog2: and yeah  the sel approach for a static site would be "slower".. but the dev/maintenance would be easier..
[15:14:55] skiphuffman: not sure what you would be selecting or clicking on a static site.  Perhaps I don't understand what you mean.
[15:16:25] mydog2: i mean static in the sense that you have a static html.. you still have forms/user actions  that can be invoked.. not static where you just have plain text..
[15:17:04] skiphuffman: Ah.  Ok.  In that case, yes. I do that.  About 90% of my work in fact.
[15:18:29] drnikki has joined #selenium
[15:19:07] mydog2: skiphuffman,  - running the py/libcurl process is the fastest for these types of sites. sel is slower as it has to use the underlying browser engine.. but again, sel allows you to do a simple "click/select" to process a form.. whereas with a py solution.. you'd have to handle the underlying hidden elems/etc. for do the form processing..
[15:19:25] mydog2: to do the form...
[15:19:54] skiphuffman: mydog2, What is your question/trouble?
[15:20:14] mydog2: i was asking if anyone has used sel in these situations..
[15:21:23] skiphuffman: Yeah. I use selenium webdriver with python code to test several web applications with several dozen pages.  Very practical. 
[15:21:52] mydog2: and the apps you test are "static" html/forms.. not javascript based..
[15:22:16] skiphuffman: Oh, there is barrels of javascript in there too.  But it isn't every element.
[15:22:41] skiphuffman: But webdriver lets me bury all that complexity and just let my tests test the page.
[15:23:23] skiphuffman: Some elements are simple html, others are java script, others are ajax or flex.  Its all mixed.   But selenium webdriver lets me use one solution.
[15:23:59] barancev: nirvdrum: ping
[15:24:45] mydog2: skip.. ok.... but i'm looking to talk to someone who's used sel for a site that doesn't have javascript/ajax generated content.. i would assume it's doable.. but i'm curious..
[15:25:31] skiphuffman: I am confused as to why it would matter.  Webdriver accesses the elements atomically.  
[15:26:50] mydog2: skiphuffman,  - right.. so it shouldn't matter.. i'm in agreement. but i haven't actually tested. 
[15:27:18] Swadq has joined #selenium
[15:30:47] skiphuffman: mydog2, Ok, well, in that case I don't know that I have. At least not recently.  I think every page I work on has at least a little java script hiding somewhere.  Even my logon page has a bit, though I think all it does is change the field color when it has focus. Maybe someone else has worked with something totally javascript free.

[16:51:04] lukeis: so... a former co-worker of mine (who i happen to know is a douche) posts for the first time to the mailing list... and is painfully trolling (a sometimes touchy subject ~ IE).

[16:55:54] Swadq: Shared cookies could be bad - does it do that in chrome too?

[17:10:26] llaskin: sure why not?
[17:10:34] mydog2: although it would of course be slower due to the browser engine..
[17:10:35] llaskin: selenium is great against basically any site
[17:10:38] llaskin: except for flash based...
[17:10:48] llaskin: well you can always do straight curling if you want to go super fast...

[17:11:42] mydog2: with sel.. due to the click/select.. it abstracts some of that out..

[17:11:55] skiphuffman: and all week, to tell the truth.
[17:12:04] Dude-X: do tell
[17:12:39] skiphuffman: It is two part.  One:  2.21.0 was not giving an informative response for "No node is available with the configuration you requested"
[17:13:01] skiphuffman: and Two: Microsoft automatically updated all the IE8 Nodes in my lab to IE9.
[17:13:25] skiphuffman: So I no longer had IE8 to test against and every time I tried, it failed
[17:13:46] skiphuffman: But gave this useless error:  u'resource /org/openqa/selenium/firefox/webdriver.json relative to org.openqa.selenium.firefox.FirefoxProfile not found.' ; Stacktrace: Method checkArgument threw an error in Preconditions.java
[17:14:28] skiphuffman: 2.23.0  actually gave a useful error:  u'Error forwarding the new session cannot find : {platform=WINDOWS, javascriptEnabled=true, browserName=internet explorer, version=8}
[17:14:55] skiphuffman: So I look at the grid and see that all my nodes that should be v.8 IE are v.9
[17:15:05] skiphuffman: Then I began stomping around my office swearing.

[17:30:06] jimevans: bbiaw. i'll read the backlog when i get back.
[17:30:26] mydog2: hey lukeis  - no issue.. more of a question/confirmation.. my initial approach was to use the sel/phantomjs to handle the ajax target sites. and then to craft the py/libcurl solutions to handle the "static" sites.. ie those with the regular user input/form stuff, but that aren't ajax... however, i realized that the sel approach could be used to also handle the static sites, but it would be slower due to running on the underlying browser
[17:30:26] mydog2:  engine.. so there would be the tradeoff.. 
[17:30:46] skiphuffman: Oh wait.  I seem to have been falsely accusing Microsoft.
[17:31:15] baijum has joined #selenium
[17:31:34] mydog2: lukeis,  -but the sel approach would have benefits in that i wouldn't have to get into all of the details for handling hidden vars/etc.. when crafting a post querystring.
[17:32:04] lukeis: yep :)
[17:32:08] lukeis: one of the benefits
[17:32:08] mydog2: lukeis,  - by the way.. i tested the casperjs solution, comparing it to sel.. casperjs is faster...
[17:32:41] lukeis: i don't know casperjs :)
[17:33:36] skiphuffman: It seems that Grid is reporting the wrong version of IE
[17:34:33] mydog2: lukeis, - casperjs.. a webkit/headless browser.. allows for javascript apps to be run from the cmdline.. kind of a poor mans sel.. runs on top of phantomjs... but for my needs.. it works.... slower than pure py/curl. but faster than sel..

[19:00:48] lukeis: jimevans santiycr llaskin dawagner jarib krosenvold adamgoucher barancev andreastt nirvdrum with this commit ^ opinions on point releasing to support FF13 on windows for RC? (look, i just called out all the committers ;) )
[19:01:51] adamgoucher: mass icon bounceage!
[19:02:00] lukeis: :)
[19:02:07] Manoj: NIce to see you here again klrmn
[19:02:08] barancev: +1 to get out a point release
[19:02:33] adamgoucher: if .24 is out next week i dont care one way or another
[19:02:40] barancev: and +1 to drop RC as soon as possible ;)
[19:03:20] Manoj: trying to getting involved in selenium.
[19:04:16] Manoj: any commiters are there to help ?
[19:04:29] barancev: :ask
[19:04:30] selbot2: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM. Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out, and stick around. We'll get to it eventually :)
[19:04:58] Manoj: sure
[19:05:09] Manoj: Updating our Website - Getting involved in selenium.
[19:05:29] llaskin: great so what is your question?
[19:06:25] Manoj: wanted to getting involved selenium, initially thought of writing documentation, but then due to my other works could not do that. But still wanted to involve in some other way. Found this "Updating our Website". So let me know how to start with that
[19:06:50] klrmn: Manoj: in order to work on websites / documentation, you need to do this checkout rather than the one publicized on the site svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/websites selenium-websites-read-only
[19:07:22] llaskin: and submit patches based on that
[19:07:26] llaskin: after signing the :cla
[19:07:26] selbot2: http://goo.gl/qC50R
[19:07:29] Manoj: klrmn I have the checkout of documentation, but not the websites
[19:07:50] Manoj: thanks for the link, I will check out that. 
[19:08:20] Manoj: I am sure there must be some permissions given ? Isn't it ?
[19:09:28] dawagner: lukeis: Go for it; 2.23.1?
[19:09:36] lukeis: i think so
[19:09:56] llaskin: Manoj: if you submit patches to :newissues then you should be fine
[19:09:56] selbot2: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/entry
[19:10:30] jleyba has joined #selenium
[19:11:12] Manoj: Issues related to websites right ?
[19:11:19] llaskin: here's the thing
[19:11:23] llaskin: tehre really are no issues related to the website
[19:11:36] llaskin: if you feel like you can add to it, submit an issue describing what you did along with an SVN diff of what you checked out vs your changes.
[19:11:41] llaskin: we'll review it
[19:11:47] dawagner: lukeis: Does r17143 definitely work for old FFs?
[19:11:47] llaskin: and if we agree, submit it on your behalf

[19:12:03] lukeis: by definitely.... i don't know
[19:12:34] *lukeis is checking ff3.6 right now... don't have a box with older
[19:12:58] dawagner: If 3.6 works, we're good
[19:13:41] Manoj: "if you feel like you can add to it" - addition ? what exactly you refer here
[19:14:06] santiycr: lukeis:  win!
[19:14:15] santiycr: thanks for fixing RC in FF12 and FF13
[19:14:41] lukeis: santiycr: do you run win or linux vm's?
[19:14:55] kamoricks: People still use RemoteControl? Why?
[19:15:25] klrmn: because they have too many tests to migrate them
[19:16:22] barancev: I know lots of people who started recently and they use RC.
[19:17:19] barancev: re reason is very simple -- RC is well documented, there are many blogs and stackoverflow answers that solve the issues
[19:17:51] llaskin: anyone ever seen this using SE2 when loading IE9: http://screencast.com/t/4OKp6PFa7QGi ?
[19:17:52] santiycr: lukeis: both
[19:17:57] llaskin: i don't really do much work with IE....
[19:18:12] llaskin: Manoj: what kind of contribution do you plan to make?
[19:18:25] llaskin: because right now, i'm not hearing what you are bringing(other then lots of questions, which is fine)

[19:20:08] llaskin: i wish I spent half the time some of the guys do in here
[19:20:12] llaskin: and I spend a decent amount of time in here.
[19:20:32] Manoj: Sure I know what. I plan for a sustained contribution and not just one time
[19:20:40] Manoj: Sure I know that*
[19:21:05] ebass: im in here all the time
[19:21:10] ebass: and i dont commit a damn thing
[19:21:11] ebass: hehehe
[19:21:18] Manoj: ha ah
[19:21:24] llaskin: Manoj: so as I said, its up to you to define how you will contribute.
[19:21:28] llaskin: we can't really define it for you
[19:22:12] ebass: there is a getting started wiki link
[19:22:16] ebass: that provides suggestions
[19:22:28] ebass: there are a couple of issues in there that you could fix.
[19:22:46] Manoj: llaskin I thought there would be issues raised on Seleniumhq web sitelike some errors inconsistencies etc... and I can make them proper and then commit.
[19:22:57] llaskin: on the site?
[19:22:57] llaskin: rarely
[19:23:07] llaskin: there are errors in SE2
[19:23:09] llaskin: which need fixing
[19:23:20] llaskin: but not in the website itself...
[19:25:28] Manoj:  As the title said "Updating the Site" I would be a dedicated committer who can maintain all those stuffs and can add if there are any thing new. - this is what my mind striked after ssign the title.
[19:25:36] Manoj:  If that is not the case then I will think on what value add I can bring to the selenium hq.
[19:27:01] llaskin: i suggest the latter
[19:27:18] llaskin: there isn't anyone really "dedicated" to the website
[19:27:25] llaskin: cuz frankly, it doesn't require a lot of upkeep...
[19:28:59] Manoj: ok
[19:29:00] ebass: i think that that you could find a good chunk of the API that doesn't have examples then you could contribute by creating examples
[19:29:01] Manoj: thanks
[19:29:24] ebass: and then add some new sections to the HQ site
[19:29:39] Manoj: yeah that seems to be a good Idea.
[19:30:04] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[19:30:20] ebass: if your doing something pretty repetative at your job with selenium and its not documented and asked about a lot of the forums
[19:30:32] ebass: that, to me, is a good candidate for documentation.
[19:31:49] Manoj: Sure. I will work on that.
[19:32:30] ebass: and a lot of times it will force you to dig into the code
[19:32:40] lukeis: anyone know where the temp folder is for firefox profiles on windows (xp)? (it's not c:\temp)
[19:33:06] ebass: probably underneath documents and settings
[19:33:09] ebass: i think theres a temp folder there
[19:33:12] kamoricks: lukeis: Probably CISDL_ApplicationData\Firefox.
[19:33:28] kamoricks: Current versions of windows don't even *have* documents and settings for local profiles.
[19:34:06] kamoricks: (CISDL_ApplicationData isn't a real path, it's an API call, but under win7, it's C:\Users\%USER%\AppData .)

[19:38:28] ebass: rc definately makes them in the users temp directory
[19:38:39] ebass: i know because it used to not clean them up

[20:16:28] barancev: jimevans: is it possible to specify a non-standard name of the IEDriverServer.exe?
[20:16:56] barancev: I want it to be named IEDriverServer32.exe and IEDriverServer64.exe
[20:17:16] barancev: and select when I start the tests which one to use
[20:17:53] AutomatedTester: baijum: hey do you have the Selenium read the docs account?
[20:18:03] jimevans: i've not done it that way, but most of the language bindings *should* provide a constructor that lets you pass the directory of the server into it.
[20:18:27] barancev: I mean .Net
[20:18:52] barancev: in Java there is Ñ†ÑƒÐ¸Ð²ÐºÑˆÐ¼ÑƒÐºÑŽÑˆÑƒÑŽÐ²ÐºÑˆÐ¼ÑƒÐº system property
[20:19:50] barancev: s/Ñ†ÑƒÐ¸Ð²ÐºÑˆÐ¼ÑƒÐºÑŽÑˆÑƒÑŽÐ²ÐºÑˆÐ¼ÑƒÐº/webdriver.ie.driver/ :)
[20:20:00] jimevans: so in the InternetExplorerDriver constructor, there's one that lets you pass in the directory. put the 32-bit one in one directory, and the 64-bit one in another, and use a config file to choose which one you want.
[20:20:15] jimevans: ^^ that's for .NET.\
[20:20:42] barancev: so, I need two dirs, not two files?
[20:21:00] jimevans: right.
[20:21:19] barancev: not obvious :)

[20:23:16] jimevans: no, you're right, it's not. but to be fair, you'd run into the same problem with 32 vs 64 bit chrome driver, if chrome came in a 64-bit flavor for windows.
[20:23:19] dimaj: I was wondering if anyone could help me with couple of questions regarding IPhoneDriver
[20:24:17] dimaj: The first problem that I'm having is that every time I log in to a website by either clicking on a button or submitting a button (i.e. btn.click() or btn.submit()) and then try to verify the url by calling driver.getCurrentUrl(), it takes 2 minutes to retrieve the url
[20:24:24] dimaj: Android works just fine
[20:24:39] dimaj: I've also tried retrieving url using javascriptexecutor with the same results
[20:25:03] dimaj: Could anyone point me in a right direction how to debug this issue?
[20:25:09] barancev: jimevans: ok, thanks for the info!
[20:25:21] AutomatedTester: dawagner: yup definitely cant reproduce it
[20:25:25] AutomatedTester: w.t.f!!!

[20:26:09] lukeis: fscking pgp keys... you worked JUST FINE yesterday
[20:26:23] dimaj: also, why does it work with AndroidDriver?
[20:26:37] dimaj: i mean it works with both, but there's no delay with AndroidDriver

[20:28:59] AutomatedTester: ahhh
[20:29:08] dimaj: the only wait that i've used in my code was to wait for an element to load by mimicking ExpectedCondition as defined here: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html
[20:29:22] Manoj: dimaj: Try running the  same script without that Wait. - I faced the same issue.
[20:29:25] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I talked lukeis through the webdriver part the other day
[20:29:42] lukeis: well... it's also a bit late right now... 2.23.1 is on the downloads page ;)
[20:29:48] nirvdrum: Heh.
[20:29:55] nirvdrum: Version numbers are cheap :-P
[20:30:10] dimaj: Manoj: but that wait is isolated to a specific methodâ€¦ or you mean that it is persistent?
[20:30:13] lukeis: still following through with it though, few more steps
[20:30:13] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: yup yet people get hung up on them...
[20:30:36] kamoricks: Welp, maybe this'll fix my issue. Why not. Worst that could happen is all my tests start failing for no reason, like the last time I upgraded.
[20:30:56] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Well, that's because Firefox abuses them to break API compatibility :-PY
[20:31:31] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we are solving that...
[20:31:43] AutomatedTester: REMOVE ALL THE EXTENSIONS!!!
[20:31:44] AutomatedTester: :P
[20:31:50] Manoj: dimaj: Yes, exactly I used the Wait command for page load but then it started to wait for each and every command.
[20:31:54] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I don't doubt that.  I'm just saying people aren't exactly unfounded in griping about it.
[20:32:13] AutomatedTester: oh hot! someone got B2G working on a raspberry-pi
[20:32:18] Manoj: dimaj:the resultant was for executing every command it took the same amount of time.
[20:32:26] jimevans: AutomatedTester: wow! that's downright sexy.
[20:32:29] nirvdrum: I personally still despise Chrome & Firefox auto-update, but it's a lost cause.
[20:32:47] dimaj: Manoj: I'm sorryâ€¦ I can't say that I follow.. Are you referring to driver.manage().timeouts() or to WebDriverWait object?
[20:32:48] Manoj: dimaj: Just try running the same script without that Wait command and let me know, how that goes?
[20:32:53] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: IE is getting too if I remember correctly
[20:33:16] Manoj: timeouts
[20:33:21] nirvdrum: I've grown very tired of borked auto-upgrades.
[20:33:23] dimaj: I never used them
[20:33:38] Manoj: hmm
[20:33:40] jimevans: i'd love to be able to reduce the number of browser versions we support.
[20:33:56] nirvdrum: And since my browser changed without me knowing, I'm usually left trying to figure out what the hell happened.
[20:34:00] jimevans: s/we support/we have to support/
[20:34:26] dimaj: Manoj: I wrote my own function that waits for an element for a specified amount of tiem
[20:34:44] Manoj: yes i Understand that. Just thinking what can be done.
[20:34:45] dimaj: but, I thought that WebDriverWait is localized for that particular instance
[20:34:47] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Is IE going on a rapid release cycle too?  Or just auto-updating on their normal release cycle?
[20:34:55] *lukeis *facepalm* needs to pass the -Psign  param to you know... sign the files
[20:35:07] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: auto-update I believe
[20:35:16] Manoj: dimaj: in my case using Wait at the page load was persistent to all commands through out the code. So I just removed them and did a RUN and it worked good
[20:35:24] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: we are slowing down our releases I believe
[20:35:32] AutomatedTester: if I understand one of the projects
[20:35:52] jimevans: i hadn't heard anything about MSFT adopting a rapid-release cycle. i'm sure that would've made the proverbial papers if they were.
[20:36:04] *AutomatedTester is only an engineer, what do I know
[20:36:21] nirvdrum: With very few exceptions, I don't actually care about what's coming down the pipeline on these rapid releases either.  I really don't want to sacrifice stability for some new feature from a draft specification.  And I do Web development.  I can't imagine any consumer actually lusting for this stuff.
[20:36:40] nirvdrum: Bah.  I ended up on my soap box :-P

[20:42:48] dimaj: have you heard anything about this?
[20:43:08] dimaj: my current workaround is to use MAC's screenshot utility that captures the entire desktop
[20:43:27] dimaj: but, if my IPhone is behind another window, I'm out of luck
[20:43:39] kamoricks: dimaj: It should return either a byte[], containing image data, or a String, containing base64-encoded raw image data. Check the return type and handle as appropriate.
[20:44:13] Manoj: jleyba: I have a question on safari Driver implementation. Its Runs fast but skips few fields to Fill in a Form. Form here I meant a my AUT that has few forms to be filled In like Name, Ph numbers etc...

[21:25:54] rpereira_ has joined #selenium
[21:26:16] Dude-X: kamoricks: another thing i observed in my app is duplicate elements on the page
[21:26:27] kamoricks: Well, it's finding the element. I've tried every css selector I can think of. The issue is that I have to manipulate form elements in the dialog.
[21:26:50] Dude-X: so i do something like findElements, then iterate with a isDisplayed
[21:26:55] kamoricks: And apparently these get duplicated from elsewhere when jquery calls up the dialog, due to some effing magic or code-reuse or some stuffs.
[21:27:16] AutomatedTester: jimevans: the main issue is addons being installed and causing issues
[21:27:17] Dude-X: and if it's displayed, then interact by clicking or getting text
[21:27:23] AutomatedTester: thats the biggest issue
[21:27:46] kamoricks: Dude-X: Okay. Thanks.
[21:27:47] jimevans: ah, right.
[21:28:37] Dude-X: kamoricks: anything too, is after any action do a webdriver wait on executeScript("return jQuery.active == 0")
[21:28:52] Dude-X: sometimes this is good enough
[21:29:13] Dude-X: other times jQuery active is active for a long time despite the page being dormant

[21:40:13] dawagner: It will be inside the chromedriver itself
[21:43:30] bsilverberg: Should I add chrome to the @Ignore list? Should I try an older version of ChromeDriver (if I can find one)?

[21:45:57] Dude-X: no problem. i ran into the same problem myself
[21:46:24] Dude-X: i would do a find by id, but then i started to get failures on some tests
[21:46:39] Dude-X: a bit of inspection would reveal that I had two ids
[21:47:05] kamoricks: So did mine, but that's actually not improper on this page. The issue is that entire segments of page structure are duplicated, so it was also throwing off my xpath.

[23:23:06] dawagner: mmhmm
[23:24:38] stephend_: man, The Darkest Hours is bor-ing
