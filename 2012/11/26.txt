[07:35:20] mazzachre: Does anyone else have problems with the new firefox and pdf printing? I am using selenium webdriver with junit to test the frontend here, and in some cases I don't get an expected PDF, I can see from my backend logs that everything ran as expected but apparently firefox shows an empty window...
[07:40:49] barancev: mazzachre: FF17 supoprt will be added in version 2.27
[07:41:14] barancev: at the moment there are known issues with this browsers, may be you faced one of them
[07:46:44] mazzachre: OK, is the answer to rollback firefox on my test machine?
[07:51:28] mazzachre: Can I even roll back firefox any more? there used to be a link to older versions on their download site... but now I can't find it...
[07:52:35] barancev: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/
[07:52:38] mazzachre: AH found it...
[07:52:46] mazzachre: thx ;)
[07:53:16] mazzachre: Would it solve my problems rolling back to another version? And in that case which version is considered stable?
[07:53:38] barancev: 2.26 + FF16 should be OK
[07:54:03] barancev: yet I'm not sure about PDF, it's a bit out of scope for selenium
[07:54:12] mazzachre: Hmm.. currently running 2.25 + FF16

[08:04:28] egita has joined #selenium
[08:06:03] barancev: so may be it's PDF-specific issue. selenium does not officially support downloading PDF
[08:10:15] egita: wanted to ask, what would be reason for popup window not passing data onto main window on close. weirdly enough selenium will not throw any error on popup close (using submit button)
[08:12:16] mazzachre: It may be that... Normally it works, but there are some cases where it does not... It is related to "doing many things at once" I can also crash the driver by filling out many forms too quickly
[08:13:21] egita: hmm.. allrite.. well i did try the sleep and wait for form to load (its actually one simple form with like few text boxes and two buttons)

[08:19:15] mand_: Hi
[08:19:31] jlopez has joined #selenium
[08:20:05] mand_: What's the best way to get rid of user tracking (like Google Analytics) when using Selenium? We've thought about hacking the hosts file but that would/might stop other services on that machine to work
[08:20:50] Ardesco: use a different GA account for testing
[08:21:11] rananda has joined #selenium
[08:21:24] Ardesco: or set ga to ignore traffic from your test IP
[08:21:30] Ardesco: I'm assuming it can do that
[08:21:58] mand_: Yes, but ecommerce sites have 20 different tracking pixels
[08:22:09] mand_: It's impossible to always update our test grid ips
[08:22:23] mand_: And also the tracking is slowing down the tests
[08:22:35] mand_: Ideally I'd like to have a DNS override just for Selenium
[08:22:49] mand_: Telling it not to load content from certain domains
[08:22:54] Ardesco: selenium doesn't do DNS, it just controls the browser
[08:23:07] Ardesco: you wold have to configure the browser to ignore GA
[08:23:14] mand_: Yeah, seems so
[08:23:18] Ardesco: unless you want to go down the proxy route
[08:23:26] mand_: Probably not ideal either
[08:23:36] Ardesco: but thats a lot of hassle for something like this
[08:24:00] Ardesco: hosts file is probably going to be your best bet on the test machines
[08:24:40] mand_: Yes, true, it is really easy to do
[08:25:12] mand_: I just don't like that it is is static and I couldn't turn it off just for one of the tests
[08:25:50] mand_: My goal would be to test without tracking and once a day with tracking (to check if there are any interferences)
[08:26:11] Ardesco: well that's one for your devs.  I'm sure they could create an easy way to turn it off if they wanted to :)
[08:27:00] Ardesco: writing a product that is easily testable is something devs should sign up to as well IMHO
[08:27:12] Ardesco: but maybe i've just been lucky with the people I've worked with
[08:28:26] mand_: Hmm, yeah, that's also a possibility

[10:53:57] AutomatedTester: barancev: no idea what has changed
[10:54:50] DimmuR: Archdude, selenium is launching firefox instance and inside firefox i see some div that is hidden by default and shown by js (detection for non-javascript browsers) but when i try to access some element inside div (that was oryginaly hidden) i get u'Element is not currently visible and so may not be interacted with' (even if i see this element in browser)
[10:55:27] barancev: selenium things that a page is not loaded, when I do something manually that loads another page the test continues
[10:56:39] barancev: page loading detection code is simonstewart's lawn, right?

[14:58:23] dawagner: adamgoucher: ^^
[14:58:53] adamgoucher: ya, dawagner spotted that yesterday. i was about to build android from /tags/selenium-2.26.0 witout that problem yesterday
[14:58:57] jimevans: sigh. i love when even an explicit error message that tells the user *exactly* what's going on and why the error encountered isn't the fault of webdriver, yet users still manage to file an issue report, even though there's *nothing* that webdriver can do about the error condition.
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Nov 26 15:00:23 2012]
[15:00:23] CarlJokl: Would a quick fix be just to add the missing library to the build.xml to make sure it gets copied? I suppose that should work.

[15:03:39] AutomatedTester: jimevans: ditto...

[15:04:27] adamgoucher: CarlJokl: if you are feeling lucky you can use  https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568688/android-server-2.26.0.apk which is the 2.26.0 release but has the 4.2 apk in it
[15:05:16] *jimevans gives AutomatedTester a hug
[15:05:20] CarlJokl: Thank you but I am actually building from source so that I can run the code through the debugger in order to better understand how it works
[15:05:32] adamgoucher: and it fails a whole bunch of the tests but i dont know if its the tests fault or the android server
[15:06:02] CarlJokl: Well it is an option anyway if I don't make progress building it.

[15:06:50] adamgoucher: CarlJokl: there is a really tiny app that has a single activity with a full screen webview in its layout. that activity binds an http service which accepts commands and relays things back/forth from the script via wire protocol and sends them to the webview
[15:07:15] CarlJokl: I get the higher level view of how it works
[15:07:47] adamgoucher: there is actually very little code to implement it (was surprised) -- you walso want to look at androidwebelement.java and androidwebdriver.java
[15:07:53] CarlJokl: I am looking at a lower level to see if there is any hope of trying to use the instrumentation to attach to a WebView in another application.
[15:09:18] adamgoucher: i 'think' you would need to construct your webview content so it could be loaded outside of your app and then use webdriver like that

[15:10:41] barancev: if you have a test I'd run it
[15:10:56] jimevans: barancev: that's fair, but you'll have to wait.
[15:11:03] barancev: ok, np
[15:11:15] CarlJokl: Actually I already have that working (i.e. content running outside of the web app and tested)
[15:11:22] jimevans: i also don't have a test in the java language bindings either. :)
[15:11:40] CarlJokl: However I can only get so close doing accurate testing with this approach
[15:12:24] CarlJokl: I wanted to see if I can test closer to the real app. If it ends up not being possible or practical then I still have a way to test but it will mean I cannot automate some of the testing.

[15:17:15] CarlJokl: How hard is it to contribute back to the project? I signed the agreement. 
[15:17:39] *eranm is downloading the Gecko SDKs over 3G connection.
[15:18:03] CarlJokl: I have done a whole bunch of funky subclassing for Selenium Fluent to make it work more ruggedly with the Android client
[15:18:34] CarlJokl: However the changes I made available might be of benefit in Selenium itself
[15:18:42] eranm: CarlJokl, quite easy 
[15:18:44] adamgoucher: CarlJokl: if youve signed the agreement then log bugs, add patches [with tests please] and harrass someone on here to look at them
[15:19:20] eranm: CarlJokl, for widespread changes, it makes sense to start a discussion on the developers mailing list to make sure the design is in line with the rest of the project
[15:19:32] CarlJokl: I will explain the nature of the change to see if it makes sense to include in Fluent
[15:20:03] CarlJokl: As part of the process of fetching tags, Fluent will check the tag name of the returned tag against the tag that was requested
[15:20:06] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[15:20:31] CarlJokl: Unfortunately the Android driver may return the tag name capitalised and so this will fail the assertion
[15:21:06] CarlJokl: Also the check is not null safe so if the tag name is null a null pointer exception will result
[15:21:38] CarlJokl: I added some code so that I could optionally specify an Enumeration to control the behaviour of the name check.

[15:22:37] CarlJokl: This could set the tag name check as "case sensitive", "case insensitive" or "none" (no check)
[15:23:08] CarlJokl: I would not have been able to get my Android tests working at all in Fluent without these changes
[15:24:11] CarlJokl: However this is more than a simple bug fix and others might not like the way I approached the solution
[15:26:49] adamgoucher: CarlJokl: ya, there is a patch for that tag name thing in the tracker that i saw yesterday. just needs the author to sign the cla
[15:27:27] CarlJokl: Someone has already patched that?

[15:28:14] adamgoucher: ah. and it seems it has been signed now so i'll apply it later
[15:29:14] adamgoucher: feel free to extend it to be null safe (since you too have signed the cla)
[15:30:20] CarlJokl: It looks like from the change that the fix has been applied to the AndroidWebElement rather than the Fluent functionality
[15:31:36] adamgoucher: which, for the lowercase part, is actually the right spot since its going counter to the spec. i dont know anything bout the fluent stuff
[15:31:57] CarlJokl: Ok that makes sense
[15:33:42] CarlJokl: I do recall though that I had some other problems and in my code ended up disabling the name check altogether in order to improve stability. I can't remember the exact problem but if I changed the check behaviour back I could see what the problem was or if it is still a problem.
[15:33:58] CarlJokl: Does the spec also say that the value must not be null?
[15:35:03] smoyer has joined #selenium
[15:35:05] adamgoucher: well, in this case it is on an webelement, and all webelement have a tag (now that i think about it)
[15:35:39] adamgoucher: so if the tag name is null there is likely bigger problems afoot
[15:35:39] CarlJokl: I suppose a null is an indication something went wrong inside the driver
[15:35:49] CarlJokl: In which case it would be a driver problem

[15:50:29] CarlJokl: Shame, it would have made sense to try and coordinate work.
[15:50:32] smoyer: @AdamGoucher: this has to run on my Selenium grid using RemoteWebDriver using the Java  library (Python is awesome in many ways)
[15:51:06] CarlJokl: I think a hurdle is going to be just going through the patch submission process until I am comfortable with how it works.
[15:52:40] RossPatterson: smoyer:Open a file containing <form action="http://wherever.the.api.lives/blah/blah/blah"><input type="text" id="param1"><input type="text" id="param2">...</form>
[15:52:49] RossPatterson: ... and then automate that.
[15:52:54] adamgoucher: 'why' does it have to run on your remote grid? lighting up browsers for a non-browser task (dealing with web apis) is using the wrong tool for a job
[15:53:26] lukeis has joined #selenium
[15:53:41] adamgoucher: (or do that and pay a browser penalty)
[15:54:03] RossPatterson: We do exactly that.  We have a very small number of test cases that verify correct function of an XML-based API that are part of a very large test suite that verifies lots of other correct function of UI stuff.
[15:54:10] zeljkof: why, oh why? firefox driver will happily populate file upload box when the element has negative margin, but chrome throws an exception
[15:54:14] smoyer: those machines are the only ones with permissions to the APIs ... I've used HTMLUnit and HTTPUnit by themselves many times, but haven't figured out how to use the remote machines
[15:54:23] adamgoucher: but the right-er solution (according to me) is just have your ci remote agent fire off what look like unit tests against your service minus the browser
[15:54:40] RossPatterson: In our case, it's just easier to pay that penalty for a small number of tests than to set up a parallel set of infrastructure.
[15:54:45] zeljkof: example HTML: <input type="file" style="margin-left: -1875px; margin-top: -71px;">
[15:54:49] smoyer: as it is, I'm using the HTMLUnitDriver (avoiding the use of a real browser)
[15:55:17] RossPatterson: zeljkof: Sounds like FirefoxDriver has a bug.
[15:55:33] adamgoucher: how are you running the tests? from your ide or is a ci of some sort kicking them off?
[15:55:52] zeljkof: RossPatterson: I thought the same, but firefox driver makes my life easier :)
[15:56:09] RossPatterson: zeljkof: Bugs are like that sometimes :-)
[15:56:35] lukeis: zeljkof: firefox should be throwing an element not visible exception
[15:56:54] smoyer: @RossPatterson:  My first try was to open a file exactly as you described ... how do I get RemoteWebElement for it?
[15:57:00] zeljkof: adamgoucher: if the question was for me, the test fails from CI, terminal and IRB (interactive ruby shell)
[15:57:44] smoyer: I started by writing a class that extended RemoteWebElement and passed in my RemoteWebDriver plus a file name
[15:57:49] zeljkof: lukeis: the question is, why is negative value for a _margin_ allowed at all :)
[15:58:06] zeljkof: thanks for the answers, will report the bug today, I have to go now
[15:58:11] smoyer: negative margins are used all the time for spriting
[15:58:11] lukeis: ah, you can blame the writers of the css spec ;)
[15:58:26] smoyer: might be a good way to hide the form?
[15:58:35] lukeis: likely
[15:59:02] zeljkof: I am not saying negative margins are not useful, since looks like they are used 
[15:59:09] adamgoucher: zeljkof more for smoyer as i was leading him to the notion of having his[?] ci container put an remote agent on the grid nodes so his unittest style scripts on the machines that can access the lab. (or to use ci if not)
[15:59:17] lukeis: nobody likes the 'ugly' <input type='file'> rendering
[15:59:27] RossPatterson: smoyer: Maybe something like: driver.get("file:///form.html"); form=driver.findElement(By.xpath("//form"); ...

[16:00:29] smoyer: but I like the idea and didn't see why it wouldn't work
[16:04:14] smoyer: @adamgoucher:  Our Jenkins CI server and it's slaves is indeed also our Selenium Grid ... and since our Java build jobs are not restricted by the slave's OS/browser combination, you're entirely right ... I can build *and test* on any of the slaves using HTTPUnit (and XMLUnit for verifying the results)
[16:05:06] smoyer: I should have separated API acceptance tests from UI acceptance tests from day one ... funny that I had this nagging feeling I was "doing it wrong" ... thanks for the advice
[16:05:29] adamgoucher: in that case, unless i am missing a couple points, you dont need httpunit, or anything else that creates a 'browser' -- just shoot http around
[16:06:01] smoyer: true ... http-client from Apache commons is enough
[16:06:39] smoyer: I think HTTPUnit might have some helpers to make POSTing the multipart form easier
[16:06:57] smoyer: but either way, I don't need the RemoteWebDriver at all for the API
[16:10:32] adamgoucher: no idea what the implementation details for http-over-the-wire are for java -- maybe a browser is more elegant (it is java after all.. :D)

[17:36:43] plightbo: I'm sure you're not busy at all :)
[17:36:49] simonstewart: Is the email in the web driver or selenium-develeopers gorup?
[17:36:54] plightbo: se-dev
[17:36:57] simonstewart: I'm getting back in the saddle
[17:37:17] plightbo: basically, Adam and others -1'd the donation and me and a few others +1'd it
[17:37:27] plightbo: and it ultimately turned in to a "what is Selenium?" discussion
[17:37:35] simonstewart: Oh ffs
[17:37:39] plightbo: hehe
[17:37:43] simonstewart: I thought we'd gone through that a long time ago
[17:37:49] plightbo: me too
[17:38:00] simonstewart: Selenium is the umbrella project for browser automation tools
[17:38:08] simonstewart: IDE fits in there, as does Grid
[17:38:12] plightbo: perfect
[17:38:24] simonstewart: (though, logically, Grid isn't the standalone product it used to be)
[17:38:24] plightbo: so you can just say "+1 to what Patrick said" and mute the thread :P
[17:38:28] simonstewart: Ha!
[17:38:33] plightbo: yeah, Grid is evolving
[17:38:49] simonstewart: I think it's better to say that the standalone server is evolving
[17:38:55] plightbo: fair enough
[17:39:02] simonstewart: I don't think it'd have existed if grid had come along first....
[17:39:12] simonstewart: You'd just always simply start a leaf node
[17:39:20] Getty has joined #selenium
[17:39:26] andreastt: Comparing the tools situation to that of the WebDriver implementations is a mistake IMO.
[17:39:33] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[17:39:38] andreastt: Though I haven't really followed the thread.
[17:39:47] lukeis: simonstewart: does that mean Se-Builder goes into trunk too? or can things live outside trunk (outside the repo) and be in the 'Selenium umbrella'?
[17:40:03] plightbo: lukeis: we can have multiple repos for different projects
[17:40:08] plightbo: Selenium isn't a single project
[17:40:19] lukeis: everything listed thus far is ;)
[17:40:29] simonstewart: lukeis: If it's replacing IDE, I'd like to house it where the IDE code is
[17:40:35] andreastt: I'll leave you to the discussion (-:
[17:40:40] *andreastt goes back to making flowcharts.
[17:41:04] simonstewart: For reference, we merged the svn trees a while ago because core and rc were basically the same product for a long time
[17:41:09] plightbo: code organization is kind of a separate issue from "what is Selenium"
[17:41:12] simonstewart: web driver and grid were standalone
[17:41:24] plightbo: and then IDE came in because of atoms, right?
[17:41:28] simonstewart: (damn autocorrect keeps "correcting" "webdriver"
[17:41:39] simonstewart: IDE came in because it's basically a wrapper around core
[17:42:02] plightbo: yeah i guess that's what i meant :)
[17:42:03] simonstewart: In fact, Core and IDE are pretty tightly woven together
[17:42:04] simonstewart: :)
[17:42:21] simonstewart: They're like siamese twins
[17:42:23] RossPatterson: I'm willing to bet SeBuilder is a lines-of-code smaller codebase than any one of the current subprojects except IDE :-)
[17:42:26] plightbo: my view is: code organization goes to those who are doing the recent commits
[17:42:35] RossPatterson: The hit on the repo would be minimal.
[17:42:50] *RossPatterson stands with plightbo
[17:42:50] plightbo: but the mission of Selenium is detached from that and has been established for some time
[17:43:03] lukeis: says the two who haven't committed in a while ;)
[17:43:26] *RossPatterson hasn't committed ever.  Can't sign the CLA :-(
[17:43:34] plightbo: and if Se Builder comes in and hugs_ starts committing more, then he has a say how the code is organized
[17:43:35] lukeis: i'm worried about maintenance and issues (bugs)
[17:44:05] simonstewart: I've not put much thought into where the Builder repo could live when/if it's merged into Selenium
[17:44:05] simonstewart: (obviously :)
[17:44:06] RossPatterson: Just think of all the IDE bugs you'll be able to close out as "deprecated"!
[17:44:15] jimevans: we have a fair amount of inertia and history to overcome in saying "Selenium is for browser automation, and while web app testing is one instance of that, it's not the only one."
[17:45:05] plightbo: jimevans: I don't think we have to fight against the bias of Selenium being a testing tool, we just don't have to say that's all we do. Those who want to automate a browser for different purposes will figure it out even if that inertia is there.
[17:45:11] lukeis: RossPatterson: I don't think we can immediately replace it, i would love to, but I'm not sure we canâ€¦ unless that is what everyone is saying?
[17:45:30] plightbo: lukeis: no, hugs_ didn't say that either in his initial email. but it eventually could
[17:45:34] simonstewart: RossPatterson: I have simpler language for the CLA that I need to stick in
[17:45:45] plightbo: +1 for new CLA

[17:46:17] simonstewart: It's been on my list for a long time. I have the language and everything
[17:47:25] jimevans: i'm thinking specifically of simonstewart's favorite issue (#141), where one of the arguments is "your own documentation says that selenium is 'primarilyâ€¦ for automating web applications for testing purposes', therefore, given that was selenium anything else is bait-and switch"
[17:47:25] jimevans: "

[17:47:30] jimevans: bah.
[17:47:57] simonstewart: jimevans: that's a docs fix we should make
[17:48:05] simonstewart: emphasize that we do more than just testing
[17:48:09] jimevans: â€¦ given that was selenium's sole stated purpose for years, anything else is...
[17:48:39] jimevans: simonstewart: agreed. i'm totally with the party line on that one, but no matter how much you change the docs *now*, you've got years of history to overcome.
[17:48:53] jimevans: or at least historical perception.
[17:49:02] *lukeis doesn't have the originals for the silly logo on the site that has the 'browser testing tool' verbage and I don't have photoshop right now to create a nice one (and my gimp skillz are lacking)
[17:49:25] RossPatterson: All open source projects evolve.  Except possibly Sendmail.
[17:50:12] simonstewart: The preprocessing of the sendmail config was evolution
[17:50:27] simonstewart: Wow. That's a long thread
[17:50:53] RossPatterson: Only Sendmail people could possibly think M2 was a step *forward*.
[17:50:55] lukeis: also by looking at the activity on the Se-Builder project, we need to hear from David Stark about what he thinks / desires for future involvement
[17:51:10] simonstewart: And Samit
[17:51:49] RossPatterson: But my point was, anyone who thinks the Selenium Project has changed its focus in the wrong direction has the right to fork and create their own alternative.
[17:51:57] jimevans: i wrote a blog post defending our #141 decision, but comments like this one deserve a response from the project. http://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2012/07/webdriver-y-u-no-have-http-status-codes.html?showComment=1352998072133#c6635747079612368193

[17:53:18] simonstewart: Training session starts in 5 minutes
[17:53:37] plightbo: Selenium never really had support (though there were some hacks) for reading the network traffic. We never did a bait and switch, we just said we won't tackle that problem any time soon.
[17:54:02] plightbo: There is nothing to say we can't reconsider some point down the road, but we've had our hands full for some time and there are good alternatives out there. We just need to document them more

[17:54:17] simonstewart: plightbo: +1
[17:54:21] RossPatterson: "Lars" is just trolling.  Myanmar/Burma is another instance of Godwin's Law.
[17:54:27] simonstewart: That's what jimevans and others have been saying for a while
[17:55:03] plightbo: Stuff like BrowserMob Proxy and Fiddler and NetExport are in the Selenium ecosystem but should not be part of the project. Se Builder is much closer to home and fits with the "browser automation tools" theme
[17:55:31] simonstewart: biab
[17:55:35] plightbo: I think maybe the rough rule of thumb should be: can it be used for something else? If the answer is Yes it doesn't belong in Selenium
[17:56:01] simonstewart_ has joined #selenium
[17:56:23] jimevans: RossPatterson: i totally understand that. nevertheless, i think it's important to try to refute the most common arguments when defending a decision that may, from the outside, seem arbitrary.
[17:56:41] plightbo: So if someone created a web-based app that stores and organizes Selenium tests written in a JavaScript-like language and allows for users to run their tests and track historical results (a pet idea of mine), that probably _should_ be part of Selenium since it really can't be used for anything else.
[17:57:06] jimevans: and i've seen that argument ("but you say it's to be used for web app testing on your own website") used in more than one place, so i'm categorizing it as "common"
[17:57:34] plightbo: jimevans: what do you think of my statement above ^?

[18:00:52] jimevans: plightbo: at first glance, i think i'm pretty much in agreement with you. i'll have to process the "if it can be used outside Selenium, it should be outside the project". i'm on record as being +1 for incorporating Se Builder (though record-playback tools are evil), and that a proxy solution is the right way to monitor/modify network traffic.

[18:03:12] jimevans: they do indeed.
[18:03:27] *simonstewart tunes out and pays attention to actual trainin
[18:03:43] plightbo: but just another example of: nothing is set in stone. We are always evolving and should always be reconsidering our decisions. Nothing wrong with that.
[18:05:01] plightbo: jimevans: Resource Timing will be a huge help. Then we pretty much can either show users the JS they need to eval to get the data, or we may actually reconsider and introduce an API for it because it's so easy

[18:34:52] lukeis: chrome is a little bit better at enforcing the element is not visible exceptionâ€¦ make sure your dropdowns are actually visible in the browser
[18:35:57] Zack1: my firefox steps hover over the main link, then hovers over the drop down, then hovers over the actual link in the drop down.  This is all in a loop that increments the element by 1. Works 100% fine in FireFox
[18:36:31] lukeis: oh, different kind of drop down ;)
[18:37:00] Zack1: the test is for our main Navigation bar.  Some of them have drop downs from the main link
[18:37:19] lukeis: when you do the mouse moves / hovers do you see it show in chrome? or not at all?

[19:23:27] plightbo: which is odd, since I'm here spending time chatting in #selenium :)
[19:23:32] AutomatedTester: now
[19:23:39] AutomatedTester: where have you been for the last X months
[19:23:51] lukeis: plightbo: much of what you've done over the past year has not been visible to most
[19:23:55] AutomatedTester: plightbo: I would never want to get rid of you guys
[19:24:10] lukeis: i know you have done things (i've been pestering you on some of it)
[19:24:13] AutomatedTester: but if we need to have rules to things we need to make it so people have a chance to access it
[19:24:37] AutomatedTester: SFC "committee" is only people who did work in the past
[19:24:56] AutomatedTester: do you appreciate how that can be seen as unfair?
[19:25:07] plightbo: well, i suggest we have this conversation when simon can participate. 
[19:25:12] FalCone: egh.
[19:25:41] AutomatedTester: plightbo: fair enough
[19:25:58] plightbo: As for "fairness", look at it the other way: some of you want to narrow the scope of the project. Perhaps this is a protection against that and for keeping the scope what it was set out to be from the start (Hugs, Dan, Paul, and me)? :)
[19:26:27] AutomatedTester: plightbo: and thats why we shouldnt have a dictator
[19:26:32] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:26:33] rbalent has joined #selenium
[19:26:42] plightbo: why not? I think Simon does an OK job :)
[19:26:55] AutomatedTester: nor should we told what to do by a group of people who rarely/never come here
[19:27:09] lukeis: a project certainly can / should change :) not that I want to change what we've been talking about recently (what is selenium)
[19:27:26] plightbo: So there are two issues: 1) is the structure "fair"? and 2) are the members the right members?
[19:27:53] plightbo: I think issue #1 isn't going to change any time soon. We specifically chose it because we wanted to avoid the mess that makes up organizations like Apache

[19:29:11] plightbo: lukeis: i agree

[19:29:35] plightbo: so probably 5 or 7 at the most
[19:29:40] freynaud has joined #selenium
[19:30:03] AutomatedTester: plightbo: its more that "we must stay an umbrella project" yet we struggle to do the things we already have
[19:30:08] plightbo: Paul/ThoughtWorks was originally part of it as part of the condition for getting the Selenium trademark. Not sure if that still is required of if they'd be willing to give up a seat.
[19:30:13] AutomatedTester: thats more the "people telling me what to do"
[19:31:01] AutomatedTester: plightbo: keeping the dream of "Selenium the familiy of automation tools" could scare people away
[19:31:12] plightbo: who?
[19:31:29] AutomatedTester: new contributors or existing contributors
[19:31:36] plightbo: you?
[19:31:54] AutomatedTester: no not me
[19:31:55] plightbo: I view Se Builder's donation as really just a big ass patch for Selenium IDE... it "catches us up" on where we've been struggling
[19:32:00] *AutomatedTester is in this for the long run
[19:32:12] plightbo: so yeah we've faltered there, but now someone is offering to carry the torch
[19:32:27] plightbo: I don't want to turn them away, I want to say: hell yes! thanks, we need the help.
[19:32:27] AutomatedTester: plightbo: and I agree that SeBuilder should be in the tree and the IDE part removed
[19:32:39] AutomatedTester: but where do we stop
[19:32:53] AutomatedTester: umbrellas come in various sizes
[19:33:12] plightbo: I don't know... I think we have to give ourselves some guidelines and let the committee decide
[19:33:13] jimevans: re: Se Builder, if someone already possessing the commit bit had just wholesale patched IDE to suddenly be Se Builder, would any of us have cared? would any of us have been the wiser?
[19:33:26] lukeis: jimevans: nope :-D
[19:33:45] plightbo: generally, I think "less than 10" and "more than 3" is the right balance for Selenium
[19:34:04] AutomatedTester: plightbo: and what happens when webdriver is dead?
[19:34:14] AutomatedTester: that is potentially 2 years away
[19:34:29] plightbo: will it really die? I expect we'll still ship the language bindings right?
[19:34:34] AutomatedTester: if I have my way, sooner
[19:34:50] lukeis: there shouldn't be much / anything to the language bindings
[19:34:52] jimevans: if i have my way, *much* sooner! :D
[19:34:59] lukeis: they are fairly stable
[19:35:06] plightbo: In fact, that might the impetus much sooner: we may be able to split WebDriver up in to Selenium for Java, Selenium for C#, Selenium for Python, etc
[19:35:13] llaskin1 has joined #selenium
[19:35:20] plightbo: lukeis: how is that so? Will the browser vendors ship a Java API?
[19:35:34] lukeis: no, it's all defined via the wire protocol
[19:35:45] plightbo: yeah, but that's not usable to the average person
[19:35:51] Automate_ has joined #selenium
[19:35:57] plightbo: the language bindings matter... if anything Watir taught us that :)
[19:36:10] lukeis: nope, but the implementations in java/ c# / ruby/ python  are stable-ish
[19:36:20] Automate_: plightbo: yea but the python bindings havent really been touched in months
[19:36:33] plightbo: that's fine - we don't have to release often to still have a useful project
[19:36:41] plightbo: so those ones are projects we offer but they don't change much
[19:36:49] plightbo: IDE might get more active for a while, but then it'll settle down too
[19:37:18] plightbo: I'd like to still see some sort of web app that is a repository of Selenium scripts, but that's only going to happen if I kick it off and build it :P
[19:37:35] lukeis: didn't paul start that?
[19:37:45] lukeis: (hammant)
[19:37:47] plightbo: there have been various attempts in that general direction over time
[19:37:49] jimevans: it's worth pointing out that there *are* pieces to the language bindings other than just the "communicate with the browser" bits (i'm thinking of the support classes for one)
[19:38:03] plightbo: jimevans: exactly! 
[19:38:07] jimevans: whether there should be those other pieces is a matter of discussion.
[19:38:18] jimevans: i know adamgoucher has opinions about that.
[19:38:59] plightbo: lukeis: HostedQA (my first startup, a Se-in-the-cloud thing) had a web UI where you could manage Selenese scripts and refactor them... macros, etc. Then you could run a suite of tests and track the success % of your tests over time. It appealed to the less technical folks who couldn't do all that in their CI tool
[19:39:23] plightbo: Then there was Bromine
[19:39:43] plightbo: and I think ThoughtWorks toyed with something at some point... not sure it was opensource or commercial
[19:40:08] plightbo: there were also Fit (Fitnesse?) plugins for Selenium that were kind of like that
[19:40:16] jimevans: ThoughtWorks had their "twist" framework, but that was commercial afaik
[19:40:24] Eleccy_ has joined #selenium
[19:40:29] dawagner: As the support classses have been brought up, this was an area the line was blurred for me.
[19:40:47] plightbo: anyway, I think it'd be a lot of fun for Selenium to have room for a project like that, especially once we're no longer beating around heads against the wall doing native browser crap
[19:40:48] dawagner: From what I know about saunter (I haven't looked at it much), it's very similar to the support classes we have in java

[19:40:54] dawagner: e.g. a page object framework
[19:41:01] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[19:41:01] lukeis: plightbo: do you think then we need to include all the other language bindings into the selenium project? (php / perl / haskel for example)

[19:41:28] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/11/26.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[19:41:41] jimevans: dawagner: i spent a good part of the weekend looking at saunter. it's a little more than that. it's "opinionated" (like ruby on rails is "opinionated").
[19:41:55] plightbo: lukeis: not sure, good question
[19:42:15] riotz_ has joined #selenium
[19:42:17] plightbo: I think it depends on what the bindings do... like we have our Ruby bindings and then there is Watir
[19:42:41] lukeis: yeah, php / perl / haskel ones are analogous to our python / ruby bindings
[19:43:01] plightbo: I think there is a "Selenium way" and we promote that one, but I also like the idea of allowing the bindings to evolve in to what is best for that language community
[19:43:11] fatguylaughing has joined #selenium
[19:43:41] plightbo: so maybe there is an argument that we should retire our Ruby bindings and promote Watir as "Selenium for Ruby"... but it depends on the usage... if it's 50/50 I'd say we keep our bindings and just link to Watir
[19:43:53] plightbo: if it's 10/90 and everyone uses Watir, then I'd say we should bring it in to the fold
[19:43:55] jimevans: vbscript language bindings! (the irony of being able to execute webdriver code from qtp)
[19:44:01] plightbo: heh
[19:44:19] jimevans: plightbo: don't laugh too hard. vbscript language bindings exist. :)
[19:44:19] adamgoucher: (there are actually vbscript bindingsâ€¦)
[19:44:21] plightbo: and as for other stuff like Perl, I think we should look at it from a market coverage standpoint... is there enough demand to warrant the project's attention
[19:44:28] eanxgeek_ has joined #selenium
[19:44:31] plightbo: so Perl is questionable
[19:44:32] kedoodek_ has joined #selenium
[19:45:04] plightbo: but Ruby, Python, Java, C#, PHP, and Node all seem like ones we should promote since that's what people write most of their code in
[19:45:22] AutomatedTester: plightbo: and with PHP, which of the 8 do we use?
[19:45:35] plightbo: AutomatedTester: the one we like the best and have the best relationship with the dev?
[19:46:02] lukeis: oh yeah, and then there's javascript ;)  we have one in the project and there's one that was written by admc
[19:46:03] plightbo: Erlang probably not... VB script... debatable (I don't know the community size)... Befunge... of course!
[19:46:11] plightbo: oh yes, and JS of course!
[19:46:26] plightbo: we definitely should promote a standard JS language. we've done an absolutely shitty job of that
[19:46:52] lukeis: which one? :) the external one has had more traction, but we *have* one in the project ;)
[19:47:04] *dude-x will work on a erlang bindings one day....
[19:47:06] plightbo: the biggest challenge with JS, IMO, is that there is JS-in-the-browser that looks one way and then there is JS-in-the-JVM that can be more procedural and block
[19:47:34] plightbo: lukeis: does anyone use either of them? I never see anyone talking about them. Are they in the docs? How do you even use it?
[19:47:52] dawagner: jleyba: ^^
[19:47:54] lukeis: they are doc'd in the :wiki webdriverjs
[19:47:55] selbot2: 1: 03WebDriverJs: WebDriver's JavaScript language bindings. - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs
[19:48:05] plightbo: lukeis: BrowserMob (now http://neustar.biz/wpm) had JS bindings, but they were just Rhino wrappers around Java. But they were nice to work with.
[19:48:41] lukeis: and there's https://github.com/admc/wd
[19:48:51] plightbo: looking at both
[19:49:04] plightbo: Oh and don't forget GhostDriver :)
[19:49:16] lukeis: that's not a binding though :)
[19:49:23] plightbo: Oh yeah, GhostDriver and PhantomJS could be candidates for Selenium projects too
[19:49:33] plightbo: if they were interested, though I wouldn't actively recruit
[19:49:34] lukeis: if you bring that up, then you'll need to learn about native-driver / appium
[19:49:34] jimevans: plightbo: um, no.
[19:49:42] jleyba: blocking JS in the JVM is not JavaScript.  That's "Java"-Script with Rhino
[19:50:04] lukeis: s/native-driver/ios-driver/
[19:50:06] plightbo: jleyba: correct... it's JS-syntax only... but often more convenient :)
[19:50:11] jimevans: i don't think the selenium project maintaining its own webkit port is the right thing to do, and that's what phantomjs would entail.

[19:51:22] jimevans: :D
[19:51:23] plightbo: simonstewart: help! they are revolting!
[19:51:26] jleyba: plightbo: it's not a problem for JS developers
[19:51:44] *lukeis lights up my torch and hands jimevans a pitchfork
[19:52:00] plightbo: jleyba: we can agree to disagree. I built a company that had 30k users that wrote scripts in a JS-like procedural language. It worked well for them.
[19:52:01] *jimevans is always revolting. just ask anyone.
[19:52:23] jleyba: plightbo: Going to be a bit inflammatory here: how many of htem were traditional testers?
[19:52:49] jleyba: I care about helping developers write their own tests.  I don't care about supporting traditional testers with minimal coding experience
[19:52:57] *adamgoucher really liked the browsermob rc scripts and is cranky at the webdriver ones
[19:53:04] plightbo: jleyba: i don't know what a traditional tester is... but they were all people interested in testing their website, and they came from pretty well known companies
[19:53:21] towski has joined #selenium
[19:53:55] plightbo: jleyba: that's fine, you just have a different perspective. I'm interested in helping a wider range of people automate browsers.
[19:54:03] lukeis: btw plightbo, just want to say it's good to have you on here having this discussion :)
[19:54:20] plightbo: lukeis: blame adamgoucher for suggesting we be like Apache :)
[19:54:28] lukeis: heh
[19:54:29] plightbo: that'll light me up REAL quick hehe
[19:54:35] jleyba: yeah.. no thank you
[19:54:40] *lukeis likes adamgoucher's snark
[19:54:54] jleyba: (to being like Apache)
[19:55:09] Zack1: speaking of Apache, when did they buy Openoffice from Oracle?
[19:55:23] mand_ has joined #selenium
[19:55:38] jleyba: I remember reading about that a few monhts back
[19:56:09] jleyba: Didn't pay too much attention. I've always found OO unusable :)
[19:56:11] plightbo: jleyba: I'm glad you're super focussed on help developers write their own tests. That means you can be a strong advocate for projects that promote that kind of usage. I just think that there should be other projects that promote other kinds of users, and that all those projects can be part of Selenium.
[19:56:37] Zack1: yea someone was showing me their resume in OO and I noticed "apache" instead of "oracle" didn't realize that transition happened
[19:57:07] plightbo: And when it comes to JS, I think that it's a good starting point for the more casual user. I just don't know if the form that we currently have (or that admc has) is the one I would promote for that casual usage
[19:57:14] jleyba: plightbo: It's not that I think something like IDE shouldn't carry the Se brand, I just don't think it belongs with the core project where all the active development is focused on the core APIs
[19:58:10] plightbo: jleyba: where the code/build is placed isn't something i have any opinion on
[19:58:20] jleyba: plightbo:  Eventually I plan to flesh ours out to serve the node community - which would require it remain async.  I just have no idea when I'll have time for that
[19:58:25] plightbo: jleyba: I would be totally fine with Se Builder having it's own repo... on GitHub :)

[19:58:37] jleyba: plightbo: I"m cool with that. Means I'll never have to look at it >:)
[19:59:16] plightbo: jleyba: yeah I think maybe we will need multiple bindings for JS. I want something that is a simple, clean procedural language that would fit nicely with that Se-repo-web-app concept I spelled out earlier
[19:59:20] lukeis: really that's exactly what I'm happy with, leaving the code in github
[19:59:36] jleyba: plightbo: I'd also be ok with splitting the js bindings off since it's not one of the 4 canonical language bindings
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Nov 26 20:00:35 2012]
[20:00:35] plightbo: jleyba: Selenium for Node sounds like a nice, standalone project that can still be part of Selenium but not part of the WebDriver/core source
[20:00:56] plightbo: I would love to promote Selenium for Node on seleniumhq.org and give it it's own section for docs, bugs, roadmap, downloads, etc
[20:01:08] jleyba: plightbo: I wonder how hard it would be to write a native node module to provide synchronous bindings there
[20:01:37] plightbo: jleyba: I know Ivan was playing with doing something like that for GhostDriver
[20:01:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: like with Promises?
[20:02:17] plightbo: Not sure if you knew, but Ivan worked with me at Neustar after BrowserMob was acquired, so I definitely pushed my preference for synchronous to him as he was working on GhostDriver
[20:02:52] *AutomatedTester thinks the JS bindings should be both synchronous and async
[20:03:06] AutomatedTester: sync for people who dont grok JS and async for those that do
[20:03:25] jleyba: AutomatedTester: nah, the promise system is pure async. It provides an abstraction that allows you to write your tests out synchronously
[20:03:28] plightbo: Hey now... I grok JS just fine
[20:03:34] plightbo: I just think this is fugly :) https://github.com/admc/wd#writing-a-test
[20:03:45] AutomatedTester: jleyba: thats what I mean
[20:03:55] AutomatedTester: the appearance of sync
[20:03:56] jleyba: but under the hood everything gets executed using the standard JS event loop
[20:04:28] plightbo: jleyba: I don't care what happens under the hood so that could be fine
[20:04:33] jleyba: the one problem with promises which I've never found a good solution for, is how to interact with a debugger
[20:04:48] plightbo: jleyba: I'm just concerned about what the test looks like... a 20 step test shouldn't have 20 levels of indentation :)
[20:05:23] jleyba: plightbo: have you used our bindings?  let me throw together a gist of google search
[20:05:30] jleyba: :gist
[20:05:31] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[20:05:36] AutomatedTester: andreastt: yt?
[20:05:48] plightbo: jleyba: yeah would like to see that
[20:08:10] plightbo: jleyba: the other reason I liked Rhino (besides being synchronous) was that I could sandbox the running code quite nicely. Not sure how much control Node has for that.
[20:08:30] plightbo: For example, I could limit stack depth, # of instructions run, length of script run time, which functions could be called, etc
[20:08:40] plightbo: only one that was a bit hard to control was memory consumption
[20:09:01] plightbo: it wasn't nearly as fast as V8 of course, but that wasn't important
[20:10:50] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Yes, am now.
[20:10:59] AutomatedTester: andreastt: will pm you
[20:11:07] jleyba: plightbo: https://gist.github.com/4150413
[20:11:49] plightbo: jleyba: yeah that's better. I saw in the docs that you can do the callback crap, but if you don't it'll keep an internal queue and automatically block. That's perfect
[20:12:35] jleyba: You can use callbacks.  That's what it does under the hood.
[20:12:51] plightbo: yup
[20:12:58] plightbo: seems like that's the one we should promote then

[20:21:21] barancev: I'd prefer to have "a single door to the selenium world" for users
[20:21:29] AutomatedTester: i think when i see dawagner tomorrow he is going to be the size of a house
[20:21:41] jleyba: barancev: isn't that seleniumhq?
[20:22:03] barancev: a single tracker, a single user support group
[20:22:06] lukeis: that bleeds to googlecode though
[20:22:11] dawagner: barancev: I think in an ideal world, that would be the case.  On the other hand, I've basically stopped reading a lot of the mailing lists because of the dilution caused by the RC and IDE merges
[20:22:17] jleyba: barancev: no to single user tracker
[20:22:19] simonstewart: Right. I'm going to grab some lunch and then read the logs

[20:22:56] simonstewart: biab
[20:23:59] barancev: single tracker is hell for developers, I know, but look at this from a user point of view
[20:24:16] barancev: where to report the issue? where to ask for help?
[20:24:27] barancev: single door != single room
[20:25:37] dawagner: As I remember it, we actively forced the issue tracker and lists together as part of the branding to show that the projects really were the same
[20:25:45] barancev: or, may be we have a dispatcher -- if you have a trouble with perl binding report here, php binding here, otherwise there

[21:01:57] *lukeis needs to do that for python!  jimevans the switch doesn't seem documented / publisized in phantomjs?
[21:02:11] barancev: jimevans: why did you put a new test to IeSpecificTests? is it really IE-specific?
[21:02:38] jimevans: lukeis: it's not yet merged into phantomjs's trunk, but the ghostdriver-specific branch has it done this way.

[21:10:35] AutomatedTester: and what about bindings bugs
[21:11:27] barancev: that's what I want to understand -- to catch binding bugs, or to catch driver bugs
[21:11:35] jarib: binding bugs
[21:11:39] lukeis: mostly the first, but a little the latter
[21:12:17] jarib: though a big percentage of the binding code is for launching browsers, and that won't be tested against sauce.
[21:12:22] barancev: it would be good, yes, especially browser launching code
[21:12:46] barancev: heh, jarib types faster, we know :)
[21:12:54] jarib: :)
[21:13:13] jimevans: the test suites for the language bindings aren't equivalent.
[21:13:34] jarib: question is, can we handle browsers on our own machines?

[21:18:11] rmcauley: Howdy folks, done some googling and can't find an answer to something that must exist: how can I manipulate a YUI rich text editor in Se2?
[21:18:17] rmcauley: (just the typing part)
[21:18:26] rmcauley: does send_keys work or do I need to send Javascript?
[21:18:50] jarib: rmcauley: what have you tried? do you have a link to a demo of the editor?
[21:19:14] rmcauley: don't have a link,no, and I haven't tried anything yet.  What looks like a textbox to the user is an iframe.
[21:19:39] AutomatedTester: rmcauley: it should work
[21:19:44] rmcauley: just send_keys to the iframe?
[21:19:46] AutomatedTester: you just need to find the right frame
[21:19:50] AutomatedTester: yea
[21:19:57] rmcauley: right-o, will give it a shot and cross fingers...
[21:20:03] AutomatedTester: switch to the frame and then send_keys to body
[21:20:03] barancev: and click before sendKeys
[21:20:03] lukeis: send keys to the iframe? noâ€¦ that wont work
[21:20:14] rmcauley: AutomatedTester: Ahhh.
[21:20:15] lukeis: :)
[21:20:41] rmcauley: I might not have figured that out on my own.  will report back shortly.
[21:20:46] AutomatedTester: rmcauley: havent done rich text stuff in a long time but thats how you had to do it with the Telerik editor
[21:21:01] AutomatedTester: and they are much of a muchness
[21:22:28] rp2: I wonder why iframs can't just be used as path elements in selectors
[21:22:33] rp2: iframes that is
[21:23:20] rp2: I haven't tried rich text editors but I have tried a mathematical formula editor that works with <canvas/>, I had to use Actions for that
[21:23:21] lukeis: frames are *special* html elements that contain a new dom tree in them
[21:23:44] rp2: lukeis: I know, but so what?
[21:23:58] lukeis: the browsers sandbox themâ€¦ kind of gets into the implementation nitty gritty
[21:24:18] rmcauley: not even the inspectors can access 2 frames at the same time
[21:24:19] rp2: perhaps there are implementations issues
[21:24:28] rp2: hm
[21:24:39] rp2: but you can switch() to them
[21:25:43] barancev: jimevans: http://screencast.com/t/7dOfZzwoVQVt -- case-sensitivity issue
[21:25:48] rp2: maybe it has something to do with selector evaluators needing to be reinitialised when page contents change
[21:25:54] lukeis: rp2: yes, and the 'window' context is then updated accordingly
[21:25:55] rp2: oh well.
[21:26:01] jimevans: bah.

[22:17:22] lukeis: jleyba: can you? haven't tried that
[22:17:39] lukeis: AutomatedTester: then i mis-understood you earlier when you said 'argument' :)
[22:18:01] AutomatedTester: driver.switch_to_frame("relative=up")
[22:18:05] jleyba: lukeis: no, a webelement must belong to the frame you are currently focused on
[22:18:15] jleyba: I was making an if-then statement :)
[22:18:52] lukeis: driver.execute_script("return window.parent")
[22:19:30] jleyba: the problem is every driver caches DOM element references on the document that currently has focus
[22:19:43] jimevans: the wire protocol end point should ideally contain different args for different intentions, with a specific order of precedence if more than one argument is included in the json object, instead of overloading the "id" property.
[22:19:50] jleyba: after a frame switch, when the driver tries to dereference the WebElement ID, it will crap out
[22:20:00] lukeis: yep
[22:20:30] jimevans: jleyba: not every driver :P
[22:20:39] jleyba: jimevans: i don't think it needs different end points, just different json params
[22:20:44] jleyba: id, name, index, etc
[22:20:59] jimevans: jleyba: that was what i meant, though i didn't state it clearly.
[22:21:14] lukeis: frame switch in particular is overloaded ;)
[22:21:25] jleyba: jimevans: every driver that doesn't have a massive memory leak on webelement references?
[22:21:31] jimevans: hah!
[22:21:54] jarib: heh
[22:23:51] AutomatedTester: yay! another isDisplayed bug that FirefoxOS manifests

[22:24:22] FalCone has joined #selenium
[22:25:23] FalCone: Uh. Anyone have any suggestions for running selenium on a remote machine without any windowing stuff on it?
[22:25:30] FalCone: er
[22:25:34] FalCone: Chromedriver/Chrome
[22:25:37] dude-x: xvfb works
[22:25:39] FalCone: not just selenium.
[22:26:10] FalCone: so when I ssh in I can run my script to open up a chrome browser and stuff, right?
[22:26:31] jarib: you need "windowing stuff" if you want to run a real browser
[22:26:37] jarib: including chrome
[22:26:41] DarkRift has joined #selenium
[22:26:53] jarib: however the windowing stuff can be xvfb, which is minimal
[22:26:56] lukeis: you could run ghostdriver / phantomjs without one :)
[22:27:09] FalCone: yeah, but I need the content rendered so I can screenshot it :(
[22:27:15] dude-x: normally i'd do ssh -Y if i don't mind the browser opening up
[22:27:24] lukeis: ghostdriver takes screenshots :)
[22:27:38] dude-x: xvfb supports screenshots
[22:27:59] FalCone: But can ghostdriver render flash content on the page?
[22:28:08] jimevans: FalCone: no, it can't
[22:28:11] lukeis: nope :)
[22:28:12] dude-x: specifically, it's a real framebuffer, so you can get screenshots
[22:28:12] FalCone: Yeah, no. :\
[22:28:24] FalCone: Yeah, but if I just like
[22:28:29] lukeis: FalCone: just install xvfb then
[22:28:33] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:28:39] FalCone: so I can just ssh -X/-Y into it?
[22:28:57] lukeis: if you install xvnc you can VNC into it ;)
[22:29:05] FalCone: Nothing to vnc into
[22:29:45] lukeis: nm.. if you ssh in then you have to specify the display to use
[22:29:55] lukeis: :google xvfb selenium

[22:31:45] AutomatedTester: FalCone: cgoldberg has a nice wrapper for that
[22:31:46] rmcauley: 04) lukeis: driver.execute_script("return window.parent") <-- does that work?
[22:32:01] simonstewart: I strongly dislike "switch to parent frame"

[22:32:38] plightbo has joined #selenium
[22:32:47] FalCone: Hmm...
[22:33:04] lukeis: those who don't like it have never dealt with crappy heavily nested framed sites (well, at least not all the time)
[22:33:11] simonstewart: lukeis: not many
[22:33:59] lukeis: i have a page object that is literally filled with 200 lines of code that are *just* switch statements
[22:34:12] FalCone: :|
[22:34:25] lukeis: thankfully i don't maintain that anymore ;)
[22:34:34] lukeis: yay for moving on!
[22:34:34] FalCone: Yeah, geesh.

[22:36:53] barancev: simonstewart should teach facebook to not use frames
[22:37:03] simonstewart: I can try
[22:39:21] lukeis: oh simonstewart there's another thing I want to have a convo about, regarding appium, seems like we may have a need to set a capability in-flight, seems like doing a POST to /wd/hub/<session>   could be available to do that sort of thing, thoughts? :)
[22:40:24] lukeis: err   /session/:sessionId
[22:40:25] jleyba: assuming Simon blesses that idea, will you commit to implementing the behavior in all of the drivers we support?
[22:40:54] lukeis: I wouldn't be able to implement it in chrome nor ie ;)
[22:40:55] jleyba: Or is this going to be yet another FF-only feature? :)
[22:41:03] lukeis: noâ€¦ appium only ;)
[22:41:25] jleyba: drivers "we" support being the Se project.  Chrome is the Chrome team's problem
[22:41:46] lukeis: essentially no one needs to support it *yet*
[22:41:47] AutomatedTester: jleyba: that means your problem?
[22:42:02] freynaud: lukeis: capability or configuration ?
[22:42:15] freynaud: capability shouldn't change
[22:42:22] jleyba: AutomatedTester: I'm not on the Chrome team
[22:42:37] dude-x: what's appium?
[22:42:41] lukeis: freynaud: i supposeâ€¦ how would one send a 'configuration' across the wire?
[22:42:44] *AutomatedTester isnt on the Firefox team and works on Marionette
[22:42:58] lukeis: dude-x: https://github.com/hugs/appium
[22:43:17] jleyba: freynaud: I think he means changing customizable capabilities after the session has been created
[22:43:17] jleyba: like, disabling javascript and re-enabling it at a later point
[22:43:19] dude-x: nice
[22:43:31] AutomatedTester: setting proxies
[22:43:36] AutomatedTester: thats another use case
[22:43:45] freynaud: that shouldn't be in the capability
[22:43:51] freynaud: it creates a lot of issues
[22:44:02] lukeis: jleyba: yep and in this case flagging a 'batch' param 
[22:44:27] freynaud: lukeis: for ios-driver, I added a driver.configure(command);
[22:44:40] lukeis: how is that reflected in the wire though?
[22:44:48] barancev: should selenium scroll a frame if it has scrolling="no" attribute?
[22:44:57] freynaud: to be able to (re) configure each command, to use native vs non native and change
[22:45:13] lukeis: ios-driver is isolated to javaâ€¦ so getting that same command in python would be done how? (part of what I'm trying to see)
[22:45:38] freynaud: it's not in the json protocol, so can't be done without issuing the command manually
[22:46:09] freynaud: if we need to change something, i'd rather not have yet another thing in capability if it's not a capability
[22:46:12] lukeis: ok, then maybe i need a 'configure' to the wire added? :)
[22:46:16] dude-x: i would love to switch native to synthetic events
[22:46:20] dude-x: and vice versa
[22:46:25] freynaud: we already do it for timeout
[22:46:39] lukeis: ah, right
[22:48:48] barancev: hmm... all browsers scroll non-scrollable frames
[22:49:03] AutomatedTester: barancev: its in the atoms
[22:49:08] AutomatedTester: look in dom.js
[22:49:14] AutomatedTester: we do "magic" there
[22:49:23] barancev: a question is: a bug or a feature?
[22:49:39] AutomatedTester: i think its there for a reason
[22:49:40] lukeis: yeah, and non-scrollable div's too :) one app of mine ended up looking quite interesting sometimes 
[22:49:49] AutomatedTester: dawagner told me once
[22:49:54] barancev: opera does not scroll, as expected (by me)
[22:50:54] barancev: non-scrollable divs == with overflow styles? simon fixed this, I remember
[22:51:23] lukeis: maybe? i think last I saw it run was on 2.23
[22:52:26] barancev: or, may be he fixed only overflow hidden issues
[22:52:53] AutomatedTester: right i am off
[22:53:01] AutomatedTester: what a waste of a day
[22:53:12] lukeis: \o
[22:53:20] AutomatedTester: o/
[22:53:31] barancev: lukeis: what is a non-scrollable div? they all are non-scrollable by default
[22:53:45] lukeis: excatly ;)
[22:53:47] barancev: one can make them scrollable with overflow:scroll style
[22:54:08] lukeis: overflow:hidden mostly
[22:54:11] barancev: and I don't know yet what selenium is going to do with such divs
[22:54:49] jleyba: Wow I hate PrototypeJS and its ilk
[22:55:43] AutomatedTester: jleyba: i do like vanilla-js though

[23:07:17] jarib: FalCone: are you setting the DISPLAY env var?
[23:07:31] FalCone: Uh
[23:07:33] FalCone: First I'm doing like
[23:07:42] FalCone: Xvfb :1 -screen 5 RESOLUTION
[23:07:53] FalCone: then export DISPLAY=:1.5 
[23:08:07] FalCone: I don't know what I'm even doing, I'm just following janky directions from the web .___.
[23:08:27] jarib: not sure about that .5, try DISPLAY=:1
[23:08:42] jarib: i usually use the tightvncserver package
[23:08:55] FalCone: I have nothing to vnc into, it's just a command line :\
[23:09:27] FalCone: when I try to run it it says "extension "RANDR" missing on display ":1". | failed to create drawable 
[23:10:02] jarib: the tightvncserver starts Xvnc, which starts a display.
[23:11:04] FalCone: Huh.
[23:14:44] andreastt: jarib: It's technically possible to have more than one X server running at the same time.
[23:15:29] andreastt: So X.Y will be X server, Y display.  Whereas just Y will just point to the display IIRC.
[23:17:08] jarib: i've never used :X.Y - always multiple :X 
[23:17:30] jarib: i guess that's multiple servers
[23:17:37] jarib: but .Y is one server, multiple displays?

[23:44:14] cgoldberg: FalCone, good choice.
[23:44:21] cgoldberg: FalCone, ok.. so is X and Firefox installed?
[23:44:35] FalCone: I'm using the chromedriver
[23:44:49] FalCone: mostly because the flash content actually would get screenshotted when I ran my scripts initially on my local machine
[23:44:57] FalCone: Otherwise I'd have blank containers
[23:45:03] cgoldberg: ok.. so is Chrome and X and chromedriver bin installed?
[23:45:09] FalCone: Uh, I think so
[23:45:26] cgoldberg: FalCone, ok.. next.. you need to install Xvfb
