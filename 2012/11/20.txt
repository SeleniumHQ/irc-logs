[01:11:08] livingstn: Is it possible to create a Test Case that uses two different URLs in Selenium IDE?
[01:11:25] livingstn: I want to first hit a page on my administration application, then proceed to my actual application.
[01:19:38] adamgoucher: just use open later in your application
[01:22:51] livingstn: adamgoucher: You mean in the script?
[01:22:57] adamgoucher: ya
[01:23:01] livingstn: But then how would I change the base URLs?
[01:23:22] adamgoucher: oh. i thought 'then proceed' was in the script
[01:23:31] adamgoucher: for that, you have to copy the script
[01:23:33] livingstn: because depending on the environment, both URLs will be different
[01:24:10] livingstn: so I want to 1. hit a url on application1 and run some commands then 2. proceed to application2 and run other commands. Both will be using an "email address" field.
[01:24:55] livingstn: is the only way to do that to hardcode the absolute URL for application1 in the open command?
[01:25:05] adamgoucher: you'll have to have different script
[01:26:04] livingstn: adamgoucher: And run both individually?
[01:26:08] livingstn: or can I combine the two somehow?
[01:26:50] adamgoucher: you can do everything you want as one script, but application 1 has to be the same point, not 'test' and 'stage' and 'prod'
[01:27:02] livingstn: right.
[01:27:30] livingstn: Is there a way to define variables in selenium ide or not really?
[01:27:42] livingstn: it would be nice to just re-use the same scripts with only one field changed.
[01:27:45] adamgoucher: not really. not to let it swtich envs the way you want
[01:27:52] livingstn: ok.
[01:28:06] adamgoucher: write it in python and pass it in as a parameter
[01:28:18] adamgoucher: or similar
[01:28:20] livingstn: pass it in how?
[01:28:55] livingstn: Currently, I thought you could only use HTML for Selenium IDE test cases
[01:29:05] livingstn: But it sounds like I'm probably wrong
[01:29:28] gabrielrotbart has joined #selenium
[01:30:17] adamgoucher: ya. pretend that you ever heard of se-ide
[01:30:49] livingstn: ok.
[01:31:00] livingstn: Any tutorials or basic references for how to do that?
[01:31:14] adamgoucher: do you know any programming languages?
[01:31:17] livingstn: Yeah.
[01:31:36] *adamgoucher waits for which ones...
[01:31:37] livingstn: I just don't know what structure I'm supposed to write them in.
[01:31:39] livingstn: haha
[01:31:58] livingstn: i've written in lots…that's not really an issue…php, python, ruby, java, C#, etc.
[01:32:07] adamgoucher: the magic you want is webdriver and page objects
[01:32:31] livingstn: But am I going to be able to write these so the non-programmers on my team can use them?
[01:32:45] adamgoucher: automation /is/ programming
[01:33:03] adamgoucher: page objects can hide some of the complexity, but script writers will still have to write code
[01:33:22] livingstn: Sure. Right now we're using them mainly as a way to get our standardized test cases created fresh.
[01:33:29] livingstn: so we have scripts for each of those cases.
[01:33:51] livingstn: So the people on my team just automate filling out the form, save it as HTML, then use it again and again
[01:34:51] adamgoucher: then copy it for each environment. that style is a maintenace nightmare so whats n times the number of scripts?
[01:35:28] livingstn: haha, no, you're absolutely right.
[01:35:39] livingstn: I'm open to other suggestions or references. I've never dug deeper into it
[01:35:50] livingstn: I'd love to have these sharing more code
[01:36:03] adamgoucher: like i said, page object and webdriver are the two things you want to look at
[01:36:05] livingstn: ok.
[01:36:09] livingstn: I'll take a look at those.
[01:36:12] livingstn: Thank you!
[01:36:15] adamgoucher: for php or python i'd blatantly plug http://element34.ca/products/saunter to make it easier :D
[01:36:25] livingstn: Also, one more question…any way to use this in Chrome? :)
[01:36:33] livingstn: I hate having to open firefox just for selenium ide
[01:36:54] adamgoucher: yes. chrome, ie, firefox, opera, android, ios...
[01:37:22] livingstn: really? I thought I looked for that...
[01:37:36] livingstn: Or do I need Selenium Server for all of this?
[01:37:49] adamgoucher: for some of them, for others no.
[01:37:53] livingstn: ok
[01:37:54] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[01:38:15] adamgoucher: but i recommend people use the server anyways as it means you can use grid and/or cloud services without changing your code
[01:38:30] livingstn: adamgoucher: You should host SaunterPHP on packagist.org. :)
[01:39:01] adamgoucher: its on the to-do. its already pear-ed up and pull requests for composer exist
[01:39:07] livingstn: Good deal.
[01:39:45] livingstn: I need to look into the whole selenium server setup. I've never really dug into it.

[02:41:49] adamgoucher: ya, i'd likely approach it that way. depending on which runner you choose there will be a way to pump that programatically into a function

[03:32:14] livingstn: adamgoucher: So would you handle the environment URLs by just adding a parameter like "test", "staging", "dev", etc?
[03:32:22] livingstn: then loading in the urls for that configuration?
[03:33:02] adamgoucher: likely. not really knowing the full context, etc.
[03:33:16] livingstn: We basically have four environments…dev, test, staging, production.
[03:33:29] livingstn: each application has a unique url in each env

[03:33:36] livingstn: (although in dev there are many...)
[03:37:24] Dude-X_: livingstn, in a project i was in, we used java style configuration files so it would be dev.webapp.url = blah staging.webapp.url = blah in a text file
[03:38:14] livingstn: Dude-X_: Right, okay.
[03:38:15] livingstn: cool
[03:38:28] Dude-X_: on the current rails project, each environment is it's own file
[03:38:31] livingstn: but then how do you override that if you want to point to a different one?
[03:38:34] Dude-X_: staging.rb, etc
[03:38:38] Dude-X_: ah
[03:39:22] stephend: livingstn: we use a baseURL that we override in command-line Jenkins
[03:39:29] stephend: we just pass it in to py.test
[03:39:30] Dude-X_: to override it, we had a non prefix attribute, webapp.url=localhost; the prefix is determined by setting the OS environment variable in Bash
[03:39:58] livingstn: Dude-X_: Ah, that's a good solution
[03:40:07] livingstn: stephend: That also works!
[03:40:08] Dude-X_: our properties reader would check for the environment variable
[03:40:50] stephend: https://github.com/mozilla/mozwebqa-test-templates/blob/master/mozwebqa.cfg
[03:41:37] Dude-X_: there are many ways…. you can use something elaborate like bcfg, you can have a property/config file that lists all the attributes for all the environments, you can explicitly pass in the URL via command line (hopefully the urls are easily accessible) etc
[03:42:33] Dude-X_: i am fan of a properties/config file -- but that's only because of that project i worked on

[16:34:39] AJ__: Can someone help me in understanding how selenium grid utilization can be improved? My understanding is if you have more threads which are hitting the grid simultaneously, the utilization will be better. Is that correct?
[16:37:55] dawagner has joined #selenium
[16:40:11] chrisculver701: AJ__: if you are looking at parallelization to speed up your test runs, yes your utilization will increase
[16:40:48] chrisculver701: is that what you mean with more threads? more tests running at once?
[16:41:37] AJ__: yes, i already have parallelization
[16:41:44] AJ__: I use testNG to run threads in parallel
[16:42:21] llaskin1 has joined #selenium
[16:42:35] AJ__: I have a grid which has around 30 RCs connected to it. Each having 4 browsers. I use jenkins to trigger the tests.
[16:43:16] AJ__: Now, the problem is - even when I increase the testNG thread count to say 100, i dont see that change in grid utilization. I was expecting to see more RCs being utilized by hub when thread count increased
[16:44:02] chrisculver701: are all of your browsers the same on each rc?
[16:45:26] AJ__: yes
[16:45:27] AJ__: its the same

[18:53:22] adamgoucher: ugh. you dont realize how much libraries leak into your frameworks until you try to remove one of them
[18:54:22] dude-x: how are you going to use py.test now?
[18:55:18] adamgoucher: right now i had i had my SaunterTestCase inheriting from unittest.TestCase. removing that so it just inherits from object now. but there were lots of _pytest.unittest-isms that i had forgot about
[18:56:31] adamgoucher: the big ramification that i knew about was self.assertEqual() etc will break as they come from unittest.TestCase. tried to be clever with the use of __getattr__ but that doesnt work with the way py.test operates
[18:57:15] dude-x: py.test does a lot of magic behind the scenes… maybe you can use another assert framewor

[18:57:58] chrisculver701: AJ__: I'm not sure why your only getting 30 - 40 at a time then.  It could be the way that TestNG executes tests or a grid limitation.
[18:58:21] adamgoucher: dude-x thought about using unitest-zero but i also want soft asserts and some of the asserts will need either the rc or webdriver instance to compelte

[20:00:22] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yarp
[20:00:27] AutomatedTester: arrived yesterday
[20:00:47] jimevans: sounds like you had a great time in singapore. (it *was* singapore, right?)
[20:01:11] AutomatedTester: yup
[20:01:18] AutomatedTester: it was really great
[20:01:19] dude-x: is there something that lets me bookmark video sites to be read later on my ipad (and it downloads the video for offline use) kind of like instapaper for videos
[20:01:33] AutomatedTester: dude-x: pocket might do that
[20:01:52] dude-x: ah I have pocket
[20:02:00] dude-x: haven't used it but i'll look into it
[20:02:21] AutomatedTester: dude-x: it might not but it works well on a number of different formats
[20:02:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: Singapore is a really cool place to go and it was worth going to
[20:02:56] AutomatedTester: even though I was only there for a weekend
[20:03:09] jimevans: nifty
[20:04:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: was impressed by the Mozilla community
[20:05:05] AutomatedTester: they do amazing things like put FirefoxOS on a €38 Tablet
[20:05:20] jarib: do you have offices in the area?
[20:05:27] AutomatedTester: in Taiwan 
[20:05:30] AutomatedTester: and Tokyo
[20:05:38] jarib: nice.
[20:05:38] AutomatedTester: so "area" is quite loose
[20:05:43] jarib: :)
[20:06:12] AutomatedTester: jarib: it was a community event that Mozilla was hosting
[20:06:39] AutomatedTester: it was a 1-3 employee-contributor ratio at the even
[20:06:52] jarib: cool
[20:06:58] AutomatedTester: event
[20:07:15] jarib: i read the other day that singapore is ranked as the most business-friendly country in the world
[20:07:41] dude-x: any place that is high on fascism is business friendlY!
[20:07:51] AutomatedTester: the ads I saw before each film told me about how little tax they have 
[20:07:57] AutomatedTester: fascism?
[20:08:06] *AutomatedTester never noticed anything like that
[20:08:18] dude-x: singapore may not be fascist. but they're pretty strict
[20:09:14] AutomatedTester: dude-x: it gives the appearance of that but I saw people doing things you should be fined for and not getting fined
[20:09:52] jarib: http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings
[20:10:34] AutomatedTester: it was stupidly humid though
[20:11:00] AutomatedTester: but on my flight back Marionette got cookie and screenshot support
[20:11:49] AutomatedTester: and screenshot support like OperaDriver
[20:11:55] jarib: can marionette be used with desktop firefox atm?
[20:12:08] AutomatedTester: yea, but debug builds only
[20:12:20] dude-x: element based screenshots?
[20:12:27] wgosling has joined #selenium
[20:12:39] AutomatedTester: but I have, in principle, agreement from security to get it into optimised builds
[20:12:56] jarib: what's the latest on use with existing webdriver clients?
[20:13:13] jarib: i can never remember what the plan is 
[20:13:15] jimevans: AutomatedTester: oh, really? that's progress since the last time i asked about it. :)
[20:13:44] AutomatedTester: jarib: there will be a shim
[20:14:21] AutomatedTester: but each binding can implement that transport layer if they wanted for more effiecient use of the binding
[20:14:33] jarib: how are you using it currently?
[20:15:36] AutomatedTester: directly into the browser
[20:15:39] AutomatedTester: no shim
[20:16:03] jimevans: jarib: that's the .net plan, if i have anything to say about it.
[20:16:05] jarib: with a JS client? or do you have a custom python client?
[20:16:30] AutomatedTester: we have a custom python client which will eventually merge 
[20:16:35] jimevans: it's a socket over which you send/receive messages using a (slightly) modified json protocol
[20:16:44] jarib: yeah
[20:17:25] adicarlo has joined #selenium
[20:17:32] AutomatedTester: jarib: its a JSON Wire over tcp, as jimevans says, but not that difficult to implement
[20:18:45] adicarlo: hey guys, i'm chasing down a very odd failure in an se test loop which I cannot reproduce locally...
[20:18:57] AutomatedTester: jarib: there is one bug that I really need to fix and then the implementation will literally be the transport layer and not changing the JSON as well
[20:19:30] adicarlo: i was thinking to have the whole loop abort when a certain bad condition happens, so i put in place a System.exit() at the critical point, but that doesn't seem to halt the remaining tests from running
[20:19:48] adicarlo: is there a way to do what i'm trying to do, or is what I'm trying to do silly?
[20:21:50] AutomatedTester: adicarlo: whats the bad condition?
[20:22:43] adicarlo: inability to find the login page after logging out
[20:23:37] AutomatedTester: adicarlo: add it to your setUp() so that it fails fast
[20:23:42] adicarlo: AutomatedTester: after managing to do that successfully, at some point in the loop it stops being able to do that, and I'm basically proceeding on the assumption that something is occuring immmediately prior to cause everything to fail after tahat...
[20:24:17] adicarlo: AutomatedTester: in most cases it is in the test setup already
[20:24:25] jarib: adicarlo: sounds like the System.exit() line isn't being executed?
[20:25:02] AutomatedTester: I suspect the test runner is swallowing that code
[20:25:05] adicarlo: jarib: oh duh, i think you might be right
[20:25:19] jarib: i don't think you can swallow a System.exit() in java.
[20:25:30] jarib: unless you're forking
[20:25:39] jarib: which java rarely does.
[20:27:37] adicarlo: jarib: i had a fail to log the error immediately prior but i think that's doing a non-local exit, so i switched that out
[20:27:44] adicarlo: Assert.fail I should say
[20:31:20] adicarlo: jarib: hup!  that was it, i managed to get the run to abort early, thanks !
[20:31:29] adicarlo: silly of me

[20:39:08] AutomatedTester: jimevans: do the .NET bindings work with express?
[20:39:16] AutomatedTester: I assume so but just checking
[20:43:06] jimevans: AutomatedTester: no reason they shouldn't, but i've not tried it.
[20:43:27] jimevans: i know you can't build the IE driver with vc++ express.
[20:43:37] jimevans: but the .net bindings should have no such issues.
[20:43:56] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I knew about building but didnt think there would be an issue for using

[22:07:55] jimevans: crap!
[22:14:33] Ardesco_H: jimevans, are there any guidelines for IEDriver reuse
[22:14:45] jimevans: Ardesco_H: in what way?
[22:14:54] Ardesco_H: i.e. should it really be closed off after each test rather than reuesed to clear down memory
[22:15:20] jimevans: oh, none that i've explicitly documented.
[22:15:21] Ardesco_H: seems to be getting really slow after a few tests (pretty sure it's our current implementation)
[22:15:48] jimevans: however, there are some memory leaks in the browser itself, and i think the ie driver exacerbates those.
[22:16:30] jab416171|Cloud has joined #selenium
[22:16:51] Ardesco_H: Sounds like it may be a plan to destroy the driver object and create a new one after each test just to keep it snappy then
[22:17:40] jimevans: it couldn't hurt.
[22:18:05] intchanter-work has joined #selenium
[22:19:14] jimevans: it might be overkill to do it after *every* test, but i can't make a more finely grained recommendation.
[22:20:12] Ardesco_H: well I can try it for now to see if it's faster and then refactor away afterwards
[22:20:25] Ardesco_H: if it's still going to pot after a couple of tests the issues must be elsewhere
[22:20:50] jimevans: sounds reasonable.
