[07:13:56] freynaud: good answer :)

[07:17:55] barancev: it's just a guess (about cache)
[07:18:18] barancev: but it is not related to junit upgrade, for sure

[07:27:01] jarib: that's very odd.

[07:48:46] N3sh: has anyone managed to run selenium tests for/on Safari?
[07:50:15] N3sh: Selenium on safari seems to not work
[07:54:32] barancev: N3sh: Selenium RC or WebDriver?
[07:56:36] N3sh: RC
[07:58:06] N3sh: barancev, I just wish to be able to run my tests for FF, Chrome and IE also on Safari.
[07:58:30] barancev: it's a known issue, and I'm afraid it's not going to be fixed. consider migration to WebDriver
[07:58:34] N3sh: and I have managed to run the tests on the different browsers using the standalone server
[07:58:48] N3sh: will that require coding?
[07:58:58] barancev: sure :)
[07:59:07] N3sh: I like RC since it doesn't require any coding
[07:59:31] N3sh: otherwise we would use more powerful tools instead
[07:59:56] N3sh: but thanks
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Nov 29 08:00:11 2012]
[08:00:11] N3sh: so you are saying that there is no way, other than WD, to run the tests on Safari?
[08:00:27] N3sh: I managed to load the test but I get an error 'No default value'
[08:00:34] N3sh: there must be a way to fix that
[08:01:56] barancev: aha, you run tests created in selenium ide, right?
[08:02:06] N3sh: yeah
[08:02:19] N3sh: the idea is to create them on the IDE
[08:02:21] N3sh: and export them
[08:02:28] N3sh: for the other browsers
[08:02:33] N3sh: that works for FF and IE
[08:02:36] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[08:02:37] N3sh: I meant
[08:02:39] N3sh: Chrome and IE
[08:02:54] N3sh: for safari I had to use safariproxy
[08:02:57] barancev: in future, it should be possible to run them with webdriver engine (instead of selenium rc engine), and you'll be able to run them in safari too
[08:03:10] barancev: but currently no safari support, sorry
[08:03:30] N3sh: but the RC states it supports safari
[08:03:39] N3sh: why shouldn't it work then? :/
[08:03:58] N3sh: and you can use *safari(proxy)
[08:04:08] barancev: it used to support, unless safari updated several times and broke something
[08:04:14] N3sh: I see
[08:04:29] Ajay_: barance: i was out for lunch 
[08:04:30] N3sh: can we expect an update soon, as far as you know?
[08:05:08] Ajay_: barancev: i was out for lunch 
[08:05:34] barancev: N3sh: no idea
[08:05:39] N3sh: ok.
[08:05:42] N3sh: thanks.
[08:06:09] N3sh: last quick question, how would u do something similar to what selenium does on safari using another tool?
[08:06:41] N3sh: Because the other choice would be to manually perform the tests and it seems a crappy solution
[08:07:16] barancev: what other tools do you mean that claim to support safari?
[08:08:03] barancev: Ajay_: I've checked manually in scout -- yes, IE8 opens the page too fast, looks like it gets it from the cache
[08:08:05] N3sh: yeah, free, coding-free(record mode) and for safari
[08:08:14] barancev: Ajay_: can you try locally?
[08:08:18] Ajay_: Damn 
[08:09:08] barancev: N3sh: try http://sahi.co.in/
[08:09:20] Ajay_: its timing out locally now if i hit http://ci.seleniumhq.org:2310/common/sleep?time=3
[08:09:44] barancev: no connection?
[08:10:06] barancev: works for me
[08:10:26] barancev: stephend: I have a different issue with IE9 on sauce
[08:10:35] barancev: Unsupported OS/browser/version combo: (OS: 'Windows 2003', Browser: 'iexplore', Version: '9.')
[08:10:48] barancev: you can't set capabilities.setPlatform(Platform.WINDOWS)
[08:11:11] stephend: let me double-check ours
[08:11:12] barancev: you can't ever NOT set platform
[08:11:24] barancev: you should set capabilities.setPlatform(Platform.VISTA)

[09:18:16] Arun_: above things are licensed one ? or free ?
[09:20:44] Arun_: N3sh - can u plz explain what's mean by selenium RC ? 
[09:21:43] N3sh: RC is a old version of the current Selenium Server
[09:21:54] N3sh: meaning Remote Control(ler)
[09:22:11] N3sh: that basically allows you to run your scripts on different browsers
[09:22:27] N3sh: if you have noticed the IDE is only available for FF, at the moment
[09:22:48] N3sh: but someone could argue that selenium would be useful on other browsers as well
[09:22:55] N3sh: and that is where RC comes handy
[09:23:05] barancev: internally (on engine level), sahi is much like selenium rc, but it has a recorder that can work wth various browsers (unlike selenium ide that is FF only)
[09:23:06] N3sh: it loads and run tests on different browsers
[09:23:47] N3sh: yeah, barancev, I have noticed that. But it works both on Win and OS X and works properly with Opera and Safari
[09:23:52] N3sh: so I am going to use that instead
[09:24:06] N3sh: if I could buy you a beer, I would buy you 2
[09:24:08] barancev: and, much like selenium rc, sahi has same issues with modern ajax apps, that's why webdriver wins
[09:24:28] Arun_: yes i can get you N3sh.. RC is controlled and the script is made through program coding's ?
[09:24:43] barancev: but we should wait some time more unless good recorder and other fun tools will be created around webdriver
[09:24:47] N3sh: the only problem I have noticed is that you can't put some sort of time out or speed of execution
[09:25:07] N3sh: Arun_ u can create the script using the IDE
[09:25:48] barancev: Ajay_: I'm back, and I'm watching IE with your commit
[09:26:03] Arun_: yes i can,, now i can record a script and can export as a java file..

[09:37:22] N3sh: eh?
[09:37:27] N3sh: just use IDe
[09:37:29] N3sh: IDE}
[09:37:32] N3sh: once u get used to it
[09:37:37] N3sh: then we will talk about RC
[09:37:53] Arun_: yes its better idea.
[09:44:24] Ardesco: if I made a patch that enabled the ability to set a retry on a StaleElementReferenceException would it be worthwhile?
[09:45:13] Ardesco: Current idea I have is to set a flag on RemoteWebElement that would allow you to automatically try to find the element again if you get a StaleElementReferenceException
[09:45:20] Ardesco: which would need to be explicitly set
[09:46:28] N3sh: here Arun_
[09:46:49] Arun_: what sought of things should i start with in IDE ?
[09:47:19] barancev: Ardesco: I can say for simonstewart: no :)
[09:47:22] Ardesco: Arun_:  don't use Selenium RC, it's deprecated.  If you are learning start with WebDriver API
[09:50:08] Ardesco: barancev: i'm finding situations where I'm getting StaleElementReference exceptions because the element has changed between the element being found and the action on the element being processed
[09:50:25] Ardesco: it's pretty edge case, but happening enough to cause spurious failures
[09:50:27] barancev: Ardesco: no need to pollute RemoteWebElement, this can be done via extension
[09:51:01] Ardesco: yup it could
[09:51:20] N3sh: what do you mean?
[09:51:22] N3sh: Arun_
[09:51:35] N3sh: the IDE is useful for recording actions you do on the browser
[09:51:43] N3sh: basically if you just want to automate the clicking of a button
[09:51:51] N3sh: then just record and click on the button
[09:51:51] barancev: Ajay_: contrats!
[09:52:01] Ajay_: barancev: Yay !!
[09:52:09] Ardesco: but it also seems like it could be worthwhile to add it into RemoteWebElement just to give you an option to make the problem go away
[09:52:18] barancev: congrats, even :)
[09:52:25] N3sh: Arun_ have u tried to use the IDE?
[09:53:17] Arun_: yes i have recored and replayed it.. it shows green colour for successfull move's and strucks with red line for error
[09:53:19] barancev: Ardesco: create a RemoteWebDriver wrapper (much like EventFiringWebDriver) that can make several attempts
[09:54:13] Bebe_sel has joined #selenium
[09:54:19] N3sh: yeah
[09:54:20] N3sh: perfect
[09:54:37] N3sh: you can either record or add comands yourself
[09:54:41] N3sh: so you are good to go
[09:54:49] N3sh: create some test cases
[09:54:53] N3sh: and export them
[09:54:57] N3sh: as well as the Test Suite
[09:55:02] Ardesco: barancev: doing it isn't the issue, it's working out if there is a place for it in the codebase and something worth pushing back :)
[09:55:04] N3sh: you need it for the RC
[09:55:23] Arun_: wait wait wait
[09:55:53] zeljkof has joined #selenium
[09:56:44] barancev: I have several such wrappers --- one that retries actions after staleelementreference exception, other one that ignores all unexpected alerts, third one that makes screenshots of anything, fourth one that highlights elements before an action, fifths one that can make execution slower (configurable) etc
[09:56:45] Ardesco: N3sh  and Arun_ I would reiterate my earlier statement.  If you are learning bin RC it's old and getting more and more out of date.  Learn the WebDriver API instead.
[09:56:52] Ardesco: It's better in every way
[09:56:54] barancev: and I can combine them in any fashion
[09:57:47] barancev: may be we should include such wrapperst to the support package, it's negotiatable
[09:57:48] N3sh: Ardesco, I am not learning it. He just wanted to learn something about automation so I am giving him advices from IDE to Server (RC) and then if s/he wishes then WebDriver
[09:57:58] barancev: but don't pollute the Core
[09:58:02] N3sh: I won't use Selenium for my project
[09:58:28] N3sh: its issues on the different browsers (namely Safari and Opera) is a dealbreaker
[09:58:44] Ardesco: so basically if I offer it back the place would be support, that's what I wanted to know
[09:59:02] barancev: IE is in well form again, cool!
[09:59:04] Ardesco: cheers :)
[09:59:41] Ardesco: N3sh: the point is advice to learn RC is bad advice you should be using WebDriver now
[09:59:54] N3sh: learn RC?
[09:59:56] Ardesco: and what issues do you have with Safari and Opera, they seem pretty good here

[10:00:14] N3sh: Safari and Opera cannot properly run tests 
[10:00:18] Ajay_: barancev: I am Relieved :)
[10:00:22] N3sh: I tried both on Win and OSX
[10:00:25] barancev: I think I can suggest to commit all my wrappers too, I'll ask in a group if this is a good idea
[10:00:27] N3sh: version 5 and 6
[10:00:37] N3sh: safari and safariproxy
[10:00:51] N3sh: and no one seemed to know a solution other than using webDriver
[10:01:01] N3sh: which requires coding and that is not what we are seeking 
[10:02:02] Arun_: N3sh
[10:02:03] barancev: Ajay_: I told you stop panic :) we fixed a couple of good bugs, it's worth disquiet we got from the failures

[10:02:16] N3sh: Arun_ dont just call me pls :P
[10:02:26] Arun_: ok

[10:04:12] sburjan has joined #selenium
[10:04:31] Ajay_: barancev: Thanks for the investigation 
[10:04:36] Ardesco: N3sh: thats probably because RC is deprecated and hasn't been updated to support the latest browsers
[10:04:46] Ardesco: try WebDriverBacked Selenium
[10:05:55] Arun_: while exporting the script (IDE) it allows diff options 1. java/junit 4/webdriver
[10:06:03] Arun_: juint 3/ RC
[10:07:05] Arun_: juint 4/ RC ... TestNG/ Rc... Juint 4 /WebDriver Backed 
[10:07:29] Arun_: wahts the diff between the above exporting methods ?

[10:22:25] soc42 has joined #selenium
[10:23:46] N3sh: ?
[10:23:52] N3sh: execute where?
[10:23:56] N3sh: using Java?
[10:24:31] N3sh: the server only needs the test cases in html and the test suite
[10:24:43] N3sh: so if you have created 2 test cases, you should have
[10:24:53] N3sh: test1.html, test2.html, TestSuite
[10:25:14] N3sh: then I would suggest to copy them in C:/tests/
[10:25:19] N3sh: as that is the default location
[10:25:29] N3sh: if you are using it on Win
[10:25:52] N3sh: otherwise just put them in /Users/<your_user>/tests/
[10:26:00] N3sh: if OS X
[10:26:32] barancev: Arun_: 1) install JDK, 2) install some Java IDE, 3) create a project in the IDE, 4) create a Java class in a project with the content generated by Selenium IDE, 5) add selenium libs to the classpath, 6) compile tests, 7) run them, 8) profit!
[10:26:34] N3sh: then you should be able to see the tests and their 'steps' on the server
[10:28:11] Arun_: let me install JDk an needed thongs first :):(
[10:44:33] Ardesco: I would suggest IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE
[10:44:59] Ardesco: and some hate maven but it does a good job of downloading dependencies and dealing with the class path for you
[10:45:39] Ardesco: this may be of some use if you decide to go the maven route
[10:45:40] Ardesco: https://github.com/Ardesco/Selenium-Maven-Template
[10:47:21] Ardesco: and if you use maven you can just open the POM with IntelliJ and it will create the project for you
[10:47:23] Ardesco: and just work

[12:16:38] Dude-X_: that's pretty cool
[12:16:40] jimevans: exactly right.
[12:16:47] Dude-X_: i'm not sure how i would use sikuli though
[12:17:28] barancev: once I automated a site with a flashplayer, and mixed webdriver with sikuli in tests
[12:17:38] barancev: but without extending webdriver
[12:17:47] jimevans: since i don't generally find elements by visual comparison, i probably wouldn't use it either, but i can see how it'd be useful

[12:21:30] jimevans: Guest98093: touch events aren't implemented yet on iOS, if i recall correctly. and they're not implemented in the .NET bindings because the maintainer is distinctly lazy.

[12:27:31] Guest98093: Can something like js = "window.jQuery(document.getElementById('container').trigger('touchstart').trigger('touchend'))"; be used for time being to fire touch events on iOS?  Currently I don't have a device to try it out

[14:29:34] kaawee: hm, it turns out that I can just overwrite ENV['PATH'] instead of setting PATH outside the ruby process... this should work as well :-)
[14:31:05] adamgoucher: yup, os.path.append() does the same trick to find the driver binaries in python
[14:32:24] kaawee: jimevans: are there any plans to be able to remote-control IE10 metro?
[14:32:30] barancev: AutomatedTester: all-hands-on-deck means that in 17.0.1 this issue will not be fixed?
[14:32:50] AutomatedTester: no this wont be fixed in this issue

[14:33:30] jimevans: kaawee: not in the near-to-medium term. lack of development environment and lack of time to create the driver will be to blame.
[14:33:51] jimevans: barancev: that's not necessarily "metro"
[14:33:57] jarib: kaawee: you don't need to monkey patch anything, just edit ENV["PATH"] before launching IE

[16:47:52] Ardesco: then pull the link
[16:48:16] lukeis: no, i mean the thing to click on is say, just a span with onclick
[16:48:55] Ardesco: javascript executor to return the file link at a guess

[23:19:39] dude-x: AutomatedTester: i think FF17 has the best memory profile yetâ€¦ home computer is using about 500MB with 50 tabs or so open, since FF17 came out. FF16 was good but it would sometimes get to 1.5GB
[23:19:46] dude-x: kudos to mozilla to stomping leaks
[23:20:24] dude-x: we don't want a leak of the firefox OS screenshots like last time
[23:20:37] AutomatedTester: dude-x: Fx20 has an awesome new feature for JS GC
[23:20:54] AutomatedTester: its batching them differently so if you had any jank that should be gone
[23:20:58] AutomatedTester: landed yesterday
[23:21:15] dude-x: oh good. sometimes i get the beachball at home
[23:21:38] AutomatedTester: its not technically making it faster, just making sure that GC doesnt overrun
[23:21:47] AutomatedTester: and then cause jank
[23:22:26] dude-x: so long it doesn't stall when i am switching tabs, or stalls in the middle of doing something then that's a big improvement

[23:23:52] AutomatedTester: dunno if I am allowed to say
[23:24:00] AutomatedTester: its not a security issue
[23:24:04] AutomatedTester: I can say that
[23:24:14] stephend: it'll be in the release notes, I'd think?

[23:46:38] AutomatedTester: ?
