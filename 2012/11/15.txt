[02:01:13] dogarrhea_: and why does it say : Error communicating with the remote browser. It may have died when the browser is there and i can use it?

[13:37:07] dawagner: barancev: Nope, just Simon :)
[13:38:15] barancev: a bottleneck
[13:38:30] dawagner: I believe the answer is: avoid WDBS
[13:39:21] barancev: lets' either drop it, or support it
[13:39:43] barancev: it's an officially recommended migration way
[13:40:13] dawagner: We gave up on it and just had people migrate completely
[13:41:49] barancev: yes, but sometimes they can't start migration because switching from DefaultSelenium to WDBS causes multiple test failures
[13:41:51] AutomatedTester: there is a bug in the python implementation
[13:42:09] AutomatedTester: and I am happy to leave it there because it forces people to upgrade properly :)
[13:42:18] dawagner: What I mean is, we stopped people going DS -> WDBS
[13:42:25] AutomatedTester: muahahahahaha
[13:42:28] dawagner: We had them either set up parallel trees, or just migrate an entire test at a time
[13:43:26] barancev: so let's drop WDPS as an obsolete tool :)
[13:43:27] dawagner: WDBS just caused new weird bugs that weren't present in either DefaultSelenium or WebDriver
[13:43:39] dawagner: I'd be up for that, but you need to convince simon ;)
[13:44:16] barancev: it's easier to fix all bugs in WDBS :)
[13:45:16] barancev: btw, what new bugs are you talking about?
[13:45:45] dawagner: Generally not WDBS bugs (though there are some)
[13:46:09] dawagner: But it took about as long to migrate to WDBS as it did to WebDriver, but it meant people didn't think about their tests
[13:46:18] dawagner: And definitely didn't think about making them more idiomatic for WebDriver
[13:46:44] dawagner: e.g. looking up elements every time you want to use it is inefficient in WebDriver, if you could cache thme
[13:47:05] dawagner: But was the way it was done in Selenium, so people tended to end up with ineffiicent tests
[13:47:08] dawagner: (Is one example)

[13:49:18] c089 has left #selenium
[13:51:42] barancev: you're right about architecture
[13:52:47] barancev: but we should either give another recommended migration advice to the people, or support the way that is currently recommended
[13:54:11] barancev: atm we create more problems than support on DS -> WDBS -> WD road
[13:55:26] barancev: it's all rhetorics
[13:56:35] barancev: I have a practical problem -- waitFor* commands implementation don't use default timeout

[14:04:30] Osleg: Any documentation?
[14:04:33] AutomatedTester: Osleg: have you got the latest code from our tree
[14:05:09] Osleg: AutomatedTester: i got selenium-server-standalone.0.25
[14:05:33] AutomatedTester: Osleg: last release was 2.26
[14:05:41] Osleg: updateing
[14:06:03] AutomatedTester: but in 2.27 the python bindings have official support for ghost driver
[14:06:04] Osleg: got 25 2 days ago though
[14:06:10] AutomatedTester: where from?
[14:06:17] AutomatedTester: we released a couple weeks ago
[14:06:20] Osleg: from seleniumhq
[14:06:56] Osleg: Download version 2.25.0

[14:09:23] Osleg: anychance to compile ti by myself?
[14:09:51] AutomatedTester: if you check the code out then it should be a case of just doing  ./go py_install

[14:10:13] Osleg: i will try
[14:10:15] Osleg: thanks

[15:47:12] Plumm3R: RossPatterson yeah, but rather than running it on a html suite I want to run it on a ruby test suite. Is that possible?
[15:48:47] RossPatterson: Plumm3R: Nope.  The -htmlsuite option is a special case test runner, to read the Selenium IDE recorder's so-called-html format files and run them.  If your test suite is written in Ruby using either the Selenium RC or WebDriver API, you can just run the test program directly.
[15:49:36] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[15:50:29] JackDandy has joined #selenium
[15:50:59] Plumm3R: RossPatterson: Ah right. Problem is I'm running the test suite in Jenkins. Currently I'm just executing the ruby test suite but obviously that gives no direct output. Wondering if there is a way I can run the ruby test suite and retrieve the output too.
[15:52:52] RossPatterson: Ah - you're looking for the test-result-report aspect of the HTML runner!
[15:54:38] Plumm3R: RossPatterson: I've used that before when I was running the htmlSuite but with currently running the ruby test suite there's no html file generated to pass to the HTML runner. 
[15:54:58] RossPatterson: Most of the languages supported by WebDriver and Selenium RC have their own well-known test runners, so the Selenium Project doesn't supply any of them.  For Java, TestNG seems to be the favorite, for Python it appears to be something called "nose".  I don't know what the Ruby folks use, though.
[15:57:15] RossPatterson: Plumm3R: http://watirwebdriver.com/ looks interesting
[15:58:11] Plumm3R: RossPatterson: Ah right. I'll see if I can find out if there is a Ruby resource then. If not I'll probably take a look at using Java with TestNG. It shouldn't matter too much which language really as long as I can alter the exported tests to contain conditions etc.
[15:58:26] Plumm3R: RossPatterson: Awesome, I'll take a look!
[15:59:12] RossPatterson: I believe Watir-WebDriver is the handiwork of one of the Selenium Project's awesome developers.
[15:59:39] Plumm3R: RossPatterson: I think I've heard of it before.

[19:12:45] arex\: Are there any serious alternatives to Selenium for functional testing of web applications?
[19:12:47] freynaud has joined #selenium
[19:13:39] lukeis: none that i'd use :)
[19:14:12] lukeis: but depends on how you define 'functional testing'
[19:14:14] barancev|2: arex\: what parameters do you want to consider in a comparison?
[19:14:30] RossPatterson: hp.com would have you believe QTP is serious. I'd disagree, though.
[19:15:18] arex\: For verifying that functionality works in the browser (preferably multiple browsers)
[19:15:19] barancev|2: QTP is serious, really. price, size -- all parameters are ok
[19:16:17] arex\: Selenium 2 + Selenium Grid for running the tests in multiple browsers?
[19:16:30] lukeis: that's certainly a recommended approach
[19:16:43] arex\: Great
[19:16:50] RossPatterson: Nothing else has Selenium's breadth of browsers - Internet Explorer, Firefox at almost every version, Chrome, plus mostly-if-not-fully-functional Android, iOS, and Safari.
[19:17:16] arex\: What about performance testing? I'd like to get an idea of user time spent on waiting for server, waiting for downloads, waiting for rendering in different browsers...
[19:17:19] lukeis: + htmlunit and a soon to be 1.0 phantomjs ;)
[19:17:24] arex\: Is Selenium appropriate for that?
[19:17:33] barancev|2: as for molti-browser support: 1) amount of browsers supported? 2) latest versions of browsers supported? 3) a gap between a new browser version release and the tool release -- selenium is no.1
[19:17:45] RossPatterson: lukeis: Yeah, but they're not browsers a real user cares about :-)
[19:17:51] barancev|2: "recording in various browsers" -- selenium loses
[19:17:52] lukeis: heh
[19:18:16] arex\: Great input from all of you :)
[19:18:39] lukeis: arex\: BrowserMob basically does that with selenium (performance monitoring)
[19:19:18] arex\: I had noted BM previously, hmm
[19:19:21] arex\: Any alternatives?
[19:20:05] barancev|2: lukeis: BrowserMob proxy, right? dumping perf data as HAR
[19:20:40] arex\: Would you recommend attaching BrowserMob to a normal test suite run, or should I have a specific test suite I run with BM? I'm thinking I need to run the test suite multiple times to get a statistical valid report...
[19:20:46] lukeis: barancev|2: that's something to do yourselfâ€¦ browsermob is an actual thing in of itself that uses it and provides that service to you so you don't have to write it yourself
[19:21:32] lukeis: arex\: in some browsers you can get the performance from it via javascript: PerformaceTiming
[19:21:53] lukeis: get *some* of the performance timing i should say ;)
[19:22:10] arex\: I plan on testing in multiple browsers, so the approach should probably be general
[19:22:14] lukeis: PerformanceTiming*
[19:22:38] lukeis: put a proxy in place (browsermob proxy) and calculate / monitor it yourself
[19:22:40] *adamgoucher is bored. perhaps he'll go troll selenium-users. oo. or linked-in.

[19:23:40] chrisculver701: its how i got started

[19:25:40] adamgoucher: what /i/ want to do is nuke se-ide and send everyone to se-builder and let sauce deal with it :)
[19:25:41] arex\: Would you recommend attaching BrowserMob to a the normal functional test suite run, or should I have a specific test suite I run with BM? I'm thinking I need to run the test suite multiple times to get a statistical valid report...
[19:25:52] jleyba: adamgoucher: + 10
[19:26:18] jleyba: too totally separate projects IMO.  automating the browser and building a record-playback tool
[19:26:20] adamgoucher: arex\: i run all my scripts through the proxy. but i'm pretty agressive to kill all the 3rd party crap people put in their apps
[19:26:20] jleyba: two
[19:26:29] jleyba: god I cannot type when I'm in this IRC channel
[19:26:55] lukeis: arex\: just have your job run in jenkinsâ€¦ there's even a nice plugin (plot) and then run your job a couple times to see
[19:27:27] lukeis: (with browsermob proxy of course...)
[19:27:50] lukeis: BrowserMob and BrowserMob Proxy are two different things
[19:27:55] arex\: Oh, ok
[19:28:11] barancev|2: BrowserMob as a service is no more...
[19:28:13] adamgoucher: someone really needs to take the reins of the proxy. so. many. bugs.
[19:28:15] arex\: I use TeamCity for CI, but I get your point
[19:28:24] lukeis: it isn't?
[19:28:27] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[19:28:38] adamgoucher: got swallowed and rebranded as part of the neustar solution
[19:28:39] lukeis: erm, what's the other one that is doing the same thing...
[19:28:43] arex\: BM Proxy is not maintained well?
[19:28:49] lukeis: it is maintained
[19:29:06] adamgoucher: the proxy is ish maintained. but the maintainer is crazy busy
[19:29:35] jleyba: it's patrick, right?
[19:29:38] adamgoucher: ya
[19:29:39] barancev|2: Neustar bought BM and raised price up so much it's not for small bodies anymore
[19:29:39] arex\: I see. And this is the "state of the art" for performance testing of web applications? (Not being sarcastic)
[19:30:00] jleyba: http://www.webpagetest.org/
[19:30:12] RossPatterson: arex\: TeamCity works just great with Selenium.  We run thousands of tests multiple times per day as part of our TC setup.
[19:30:21] barancev|2: fortunately, there are others cloud perf testing services
[19:30:50] arex\: RossPatterson: Awesome. What do you do for performance testing? Not sure if you've seen the discussion.
[19:31:09] RossPatterson: I've been watching.
[19:31:16] arex\: :-)
[19:31:48] RossPatterson: Our performance testing is completely separate - we use jMeter for that.  We use Selenium for functional testing - end-to-end, all parts flying in formation, nothing simulated except the human being.
[19:31:51] adamgoucher: do you have a performance problem? or is this just a solution checkbox? 90% of the times, se is not the solution. 
[19:32:02] arex\: I've configured MSTest, FxCop and StyleCop on our project, so I think it's time to get some functional testing and performance testing up.
[19:32:47] *adamgoucher is presently of the thinking that performance testing on anything other than production is a waste of cycles
[19:33:03] barancev|2: don't mess "server perf testing" (responce time, servrer side cacheing etc) and "client pert testing" (rendering time, client side cacheing etc)
[19:33:24] FailCone: Anyone know where Chrome keeps its user profiles on Ubuntu?
[19:33:32] lukeis: adamgoucher: you should talk to a few of my prior companies who demanded it in staging environments ;)
[19:33:44] FailCone: alternately, if I can abuse my script to get to it?
[19:34:00] adamgoucher: lukeis: i mean, i'm happy to charge for it, but i caveot the hell out of it
[19:34:26] dude-x: i think it's good to record times of wd actions in regular webdriver tests to keep an eye on general performance
[19:34:33] arex\: RossPatterson: I see. Is it a problem that JMeter doesn't run JS? I guess you can simulate a user interacting with the web page with multiple URL enties in JMeter, but you don't get any rendering times etc...?
[19:34:33] rpereira has joined #selenium
[19:34:47] adamgoucher: FailCone: http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=142059 looks like its ~/.config/google-chrome
[19:35:04] lukeis: my metrics on timingâ€¦ how fast / slow is it taking the suite to run ;)
[19:35:09] arex\: barancev|2: Exactly. JMeter for server side performance testing, but what for client side?
[19:35:27] FailCone: Wooo. Awesome. Thanks.
[19:35:37] RossPatterson: Yes, it's a problem.
[19:35:48] arex\: RossPatterson: Do you run any client side performance testing?
[19:35:51] jleyba: FailCone: chromedriver uses unique profiles like the FFDriver
[19:35:55] RossPatterson: But our goal for performance testing isn't "find out how fast real user response can be".  We still have manual testing too, and we get that from human experience.
[19:36:03] arex\: I see.
[19:36:04] FailCone: aaaa
[19:36:09] adamgoucher: use explicit waits, crank your wait length way down and when it kacks you have something to investigate
[19:36:20] FailCone: Do they live in a seperate directory while the session is up?
[19:36:32] arex\: RossPatterson: Could attaching BrowserMob Proxy to a normal Selenium run be an idea?
[19:36:34] FailCone: Trying to get those cookies. Heh.
[19:36:37] RossPatterson: Our performance goal instead is "find out how much we can do before it explodes and the shrapnel kills everyone nearby".  jMeter does that well.
[19:36:58] barancev|2: arex\: browser plugins -- Pagespeed, Firebug
[19:37:13] arex\: barancev|2: Preferably automated! :)
[19:37:19] RossPatterson: Our Selenium focus is to make sure that the product functions correctly over a long time-base, despite rapid change on a very large codebase.
[19:37:22] barancev|2: no idea
[19:37:31] arex\: barancev|2: What do you think about Selenium + BrowserMob Proxy?
[19:38:09] barancev|2: proxy can't measure rendering time, JS performance in the browser
[19:38:21] barancev|2: only browser plugins can
[19:38:21] FailCone: Kinda lame that I can't get a list of sites to traverse to to check cookies. :sigh:
[19:38:33] arex\: Oh. I guess I've misunderstood the content of HARs
[19:38:55] arex\: RossPatterson: I see.
[19:39:37] arex\: RossPatterson: I'd be interested in what other tools you use, since you seem to have a decent size setup :)
[19:39:47] mountain1228 has left #selenium
[19:40:02] adamgoucher: re whether using a proxy is a good idea - http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/23960184.jpg
[19:40:10] RossPatterson: Sure.
[19:42:21] RossPatterson: The product is Windows-based - a rather complex system of ASP websites, with a WCF service architecture behind them, and SQL Server for the databases.
[19:42:51] RossPatterson: We run TeamCity with EC2-based build agents, which compile on every check-in and test several times a day.
[19:43:28] arex\: So far, pretty similar, although we have multiple build agents on a single cluster
[19:43:45] RossPatterson: We used to run all tests on all checkins, but when the test suite grew to about 26 hours, that got expensive.  We run it in 14 separate builds, so there's lots of parallelism, but it's still a lot.
[19:43:48] adamgoucher: hrm. is /session/:session/source the 'current' source including any ajax-y transformations?
[19:43:59] jleyba: yes
[19:44:05] chrisculver701: 26 hrs O_o
[19:44:19] arex\: RossPatterson: all tests, i'm assuming that is not just unit tests :)
[19:44:26] *adamgoucher has found a rabbit hole then :D
[19:44:48] adamgoucher: (just in time to start to think about picking the boy up â€¦ naturally)
[19:44:51] RossPatterson: So now we run them several times a day, and they complete inside about 3 hours (we cap the build-agent pool, so we don't run all 14 at once :-) )
[19:45:05] RossPatterson: Oh, that's just the Selenium tests.
[19:45:24] arex\: You only ran Selenium tests on each checkin?
[19:45:31] RossPatterson: Unit tests are a separate thing, and like you'd expect, then run much faster and as part of every checkin.
[19:45:37] arex\: Ah, ok.
[19:45:45] stephend has joined #selenium
[19:46:59] Mkop1 has joined #selenium
[19:47:08] RossPatterson: Each builld agent has the full stack, so each test build runs self-contained and isolated from every other build.  And we start by running the installers created at the end of the compilation build, to make sure that the product is installed correctly before the tests start.
[19:48:10] RossPatterson: We're a C# shop, so our tests are coded in C# against the Selenium RC API, and annotated for execution via NUnit.  Which means that TeamCity reports nicely on pass/fail stats and histories for us, just as if the tests were unit tests.
[19:48:28] arex\: That is my plan as well :-)
[19:48:36] RossPatterson: It works very well.
[19:49:47] chrisculver701: RossPatterson: are you guys looking into switching to Webdriver? or creating new tests with it?  I imagine your test suite size creates some large difficulties there and the aging of RC does also
[19:50:09] arex\: Ah yes, I was prototyping with Webdriver today.
[19:50:23] lukeis: best way to go ;)
[19:50:28] chrisculver701: or is it webdriver RC? i get confused
[19:50:41] RossPatterson: Nope.  Not because WebDriver is bad (although I still think the RC API is the better one), but because we've got a lot of RC experience.
[19:51:07] lukeis: RC == old (like RossPatterson) and WebDriver == new (aka better) ;)
[19:51:19] RossPatterson: In some opinions :-)

[19:52:16] chrisculver701: arex\ are you familiar with PageObjects?
[19:52:21] RossPatterson: That's a good mix.
[19:52:28] lukeis: RossPatterson: do you guys plan on supporting mobile in any way in the future though? (cause RC don't handle that...)
[19:52:45] RossPatterson: PageObjects are the bee's knees.
[19:52:49] arex\: chrisculver701: I don't think so. Although it rings a bell...
[19:52:59] chrisculver701: :pageobject

[19:53:46] arex\: thanks for that :)
[19:53:46] chrisculver701: it felt that way for me anyways
[19:53:52] arex\: i can imagine
[19:53:53] RossPatterson: lukeis: Actually, yes.  We just rolled out our first mobile version, and we had to test it manually.  But it was under such rapid development and design, that we wouldn't have bothered to write automated tests even if we had the tools to do so.
[19:54:25] arex\: RossPatterson: Do you see any value in BrowserMob Proxy?
[19:54:50] RossPatterson: An old coworker once explained that any test he couldn't run for two releases unchanged was more costly than manual testing.  "Release" is now stale concept, but I use "calendar quarter" as an equivalent.
[19:54:54] lukeis: ah fun.. manual testing :(  we still have a % of test cases that need to be manual

[19:58:39] RossPatterson: I don't have an opinion on the BrowserMob Proxy.  We don't use it, it wouldn't help us do what we want to do.  When we're trying to learn things like page-load-speed, we use things like FireBug.
[19:58:41] RossPatterson: :-)
[19:58:56] lukeis: work is going to be providing me with an iPad mini ;) looking forward to getting it
[19:59:03] chrisculver701: congrats
[19:59:26] arex\: RossPatterson: Do you think there is value in measuring loading/rendering times in the Selenium test suite? FireBug is manual and can only be run i FireFox which seems like big disadvantages.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Nov 15 20:00:58 2012]
[20:00:58] RossPatterson: No, I don't see the value.  Unless your system somehow degrades over time, or under large load, humans with complicated stopwatches (i.e., FireBug's Network tab) can do just fine.  But that's what we use jMeter for - to find out how our system performs under large load, or over long times.
[20:01:29] chrisculver701: query: Anybody read any of Rex Black's testing books?
[20:01:54] arex\: RossPatterson: JMeter doesn't measure anything client side, though :<
[20:02:16] *RossPatterson started as an assembler programmer in the 1970s.  What is this "testing" you speak of?
[20:02:32] arex\: God, not one of those ;P
[20:02:37] RossPatterson: arex\: True.  And for us, that may someday become a problem.
[20:02:43] RossPatterson: But not yet.
[20:03:03] RossPatterson: #getoffmylawn
[20:03:06] arex\: RossPatterson: If it was a problem today, any idea how you would measure/test it? :)
[20:03:20] lukeis: monitoring server response times + monitoring page weight is good enough IMO
[20:04:09] arex\: Seems dangerous
[20:04:14] *lukeis goes back to just testing iOSâ€¦ cause that's all i do anymore ;)
[20:04:38] RossPatterson: Dunno.  The problem with "testing system performance" is that nobody ever seems to know what the success criteria are.  Instead they just want to collect numbers and then either smile or get sick to their stomachs.
[20:04:59] RossPatterson: If you can't define "success" in advance, it isn't a test.
[20:05:09] lukeis: +1
[20:05:39] arex\: I'd want to investigate any action that takes > 2 seconds, for instance
[20:05:44] RossPatterson: MEASURING system performance is a different story.  Especially on a long time base, where you can compare past and current performance.
[20:06:52] arex\: I'd want to measure a new version thoroughly before I put it into production
[20:07:01] RossPatterson: Then that's easy: Click(someElement); WaitForPageToLoad(timeout=TwoSeconds); /* throws an exception if it times out */ :-)
[20:07:01] arex\: I don't know if you call that testing or not
[20:07:40] arex\: Yes, but I'm not sure if Selenium is right for that job. I'd want to have multiple measurements and generate a report probably.
[20:08:22] RossPatterson: I love anything that explodes with a lot of flames when something isn't working.  People notice mushroom clouds on the horizon.
[20:09:54] jimevans: RossPatterson: at what point do you fork the .net selenium rc code to maintain it on your own?
[20:09:58] *jimevans ducks
[20:10:13] *dude-x chuckles
[20:10:39] *jimevans really, really doesn't like the rc api
[20:11:34] jimevans: selenium rc == god object anti-pattern (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object)
[20:12:04] RossPatterson: jimevans: March, 2010, svn #6864, just for safety.  Might do it yet again - 2.2x is nice code :-)

[22:33:03] dude-x: Ardesco_H: how does that work? you pass in a webelement and it will return a hashmap with a by object and string?
[22:33:30] Ardesco_H: what i have so far is only returning strings
[22:33:31] lukeis: you should have it return a By object instead :)
[22:33:46] Ardesco_H: but should be trival to take the by sting and locator and turn it into a By objetc
[22:33:50] dude-x: i like having the string for reporting purposes
[22:34:06] Ardesco_H: i know but i can't be bthered to do the rest tonight
[22:34:11] Ardesco_H: tomorrow probably
[22:34:14] *lukeis doesn't have a need for shenanigans like that utility ;)
[22:34:31] Ardesco_H: i don't either
[22:34:48] Ardesco_H: but it seems to be something that comes up now and agan
[22:34:52] lukeis: so instead you give them the gun to shoot themselves? :-D

[22:36:17] lukeis: every time i've heard of a thought of need this there's always been a better way
[22:36:56] Ardesco_H: i have a few page objects that hold a locator to wait for the element to exist and then a webelemtn with a findby to actually use
[22:37:16] Ardesco_H: i suppose i could get rid og the locator buit
[22:37:25] Ardesco_H: but it's a lot of faff to get rid of one line of code

[22:38:02] lukeis: really you mean page factory not page object in this case right?
[22:38:12] Ardesco_H: yes page factory sorry not page object
[22:38:42] *lukeis doesn't use page factory and i keep all my locators as static By's in the class
[22:38:56] Ardesco_H: i like page factory's
[22:39:15] Ardesco_H: i don't like static by's all ver the place generally
[22:39:45] lukeis: @Find(Byâ€¦ is the same thing to me
[22:39:59] barancev|2: holy shit! it is much easier to make a custom selenium build with public locator (that is already stored in RemoteWebElement)
[22:40:05] Ardesco_H: i'd show you my current test codebase if you ere in london on Nov 27th
[22:40:53] Ardesco_H: barancev|2, I suspect most people won't want to use a custom selenium build
[22:41:16] Ardesco_H: well java people who use maven/gradle anyway
[22:41:16] Ardesco_H: :)
[22:41:26] Ardesco_H: or people not confortable with making a custom build
[22:42:02] lukeis: i think he means custom class / extension that you use rather than a custom build (no need to rebuilt it!)
[22:43:01] barancev|2: I mean a custom selenium build with changed visibility of locator field in RemoteWebElement :)
[22:43:09] Ardesco_H: ah
[22:43:30] barancev|2: or, use reflection to get access to a private field, it's more "java-style"
[22:44:37] Ardesco_H: or just use groovy and let it do that for you
[22:44:38] Ardesco_H: :)
[22:45:13] *Ardesco_H has got stressed at a few people doing that with webelements in his page factory's that were private for a reason
[22:45:18] barancev|2: or, implement a proxy (much like EventFiringWebDriver) and store locators in an extention of By
[22:45:39] barancev|2: or, stop getting locators out of element!
[22:45:49] lukeis: +1 for the latter ;)
[22:46:28] Ardesco_H: next you'll be saying don't use Excel as a datasource/reporting mechanism for Selenium...
[22:46:36] Ardesco_H: or don't try and test flash
[22:46:38] Ardesco_H: or xml
[22:46:40] Ardesco_H: or databases
[22:46:42] barancev|2: excel? why not

[22:47:12] barancev|2: how is it related to a useless information about locator?
[22:47:19] lukeis: Ardesco_H: how do i use Selenium to read from my xls for my data? ;)
[22:47:42] Ardesco_H: in my opinion using excel wil selenium is as stupid an idea
[22:47:47] Ardesco_H: wil=with
[22:48:09] barancev|2: I have nothing against Excel as a data storage
[22:48:09] Ardesco_H: it's generally used as a way to get manual testers "doing automation" without undertsnading how to automate
[22:48:20] barancev|2: use a lib and read the data
[22:48:25] lukeis: yep
[22:48:33] Ardesco_H: so manual testers spend all day filling in columns of data into excel spreasheets to use as data in tests
[22:48:39] barancev|2: a data! not scenarious"
[22:48:41] Ardesco_H: instead of actually doing fricking manual testing
[22:48:50] Ardesco_H: one of my pet peeves
[22:49:00] barancev|2: excelk is a good data generation tool
[22:49:04] dude-x: i wouldn't use excel to automate tests, but i would use excel to automatically create data
[22:49:27] Ardesco_H: it all sounds reasonable, but it always ends up being a mechanism to turn manual testers into data entry clerks who don't test
[22:49:47] Ardesco_H: i have not yet seen an implementation that uses Excel as a data source that doesn't remove manual testers from manual testing
[22:50:14] Ardesco_H: maybe i've just had a lot of bad experiences with excel based things over the past 5 years
[22:50:33] barancev|2: with excel you can generate tons of interesting data that you never be able to check manually. so automate a scenario and use it to process the generated data
[22:50:44] *lukeis doesn't use excelâ€¦ prefer csv or json for my data :)
[22:51:28] dude-x: i really mean CSV 
[22:51:30] barancev|2: it depends on what is the primary tool -- excel or The Mind
[22:51:40] dude-x: but to the regular user, they'd use excel or calc
[22:52:16] lukeis: python; import csv
[22:52:17] Ardesco_H: as i said i've probably seen too many bad implementations using excel in a bad way
[22:52:18] lukeis: :)
[22:52:27] Ardesco_H: seems especially popular with offshore teams
[22:53:13] Ardesco_H: hell i saw 2 presentations at seconf that were effectivly massive excel timesinks to enable manual testers who didn't undertsnad automation to be automated testers
[22:53:32] Ardesco_H: just teach them how to code ffs
[22:53:44] Ardesco_H: if they can't do it they shouldn't be automated testers
[22:53:45] barancev|2: ok, no matter, I told stop getting locators from the elements! :)

[22:54:44] Ardesco_H: heh
[22:54:51] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[22:54:53] barancev|2: what can be a purpose to get locators out of elements?
[22:55:25] barancev|2: (in view of the fact that the same locator can already be not valid or can find another element)
[22:55:28] lukeis: a bad idea ;)
[22:55:37] Ardesco_H: to be honest the only useful thin i can think of is to pull @findBy information out of a webelement in a pagefactory
[22:55:52] barancev|2: what for?
[22:55:56] Ardesco_H: but even then, this is a whole load of code to get rid of 1 line
[22:56:33] Ardesco_H: so you can plug a by locator into an expectedconditions functiona that needs a by object
[22:57:00] barancev|2: then, don't use page factory
[22:57:13] barancev|2: use a class that stores locators
[22:57:20] barancev|2: like lukeis does
[22:57:24] Ardesco_H: we are going round in circles now
[22:57:34] Ardesco_H: you can store by locators in a page factory too
[22:57:37] lukeis: round and round we go ;)
[22:57:42] Ardesco_H: that doesn't stop people from wanting to do things like this
[22:58:39] barancev|2: yes, people like to pervert things :)
[22:58:40] Ardesco_H: Personally i like page factory's
