[09:31:11] richardshaw: i've just upgraded to 2.26 and i'm getting RROR - Failed to start new browser session, shutdown browser and clear all session data.  I've seen so many conflicting methods to dealing with this, what is the correct way ?
[09:31:35] richardshaw: firefox is the browser, on ubuntu, I can fire it up and connec to a site
[09:32:10] richardshaw: and the other part of the error was Timed out waiting for profile to be created!
[09:32:29] stephend: which firefox?
[09:32:33] Manoj_: selenium 2.26 is out. but I still see in the Downloads page as 2.25
[09:34:02] richardshaw: stephend: Mozilla Firefox 16.0.2
[09:34:24] richardshaw: Manoj_: it's avaialble from https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list
[09:34:26] stephend: hmm, should be supported, I'd think
[09:35:14] stephend: we've got 16 on our grid, but I don't think we updated to the security release; let me check
[09:36:10] Manoj_: richardshaw, Well I have a copy of 2.26 but just raised as a concern that the DEV may fix. Though the 2.26 is out. Our seleniumhq.org/downloads pages shows as 2.25
[09:37:13] stephend: they've fixed, just haven't pushed the site, I think
[09:37:57] stephend: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=18048

[09:48:51] Manoj_: Paul Grandjean was saying about that. In that. Could you please see them.
[09:49:10] richardshaw: ok doesn't look to be an issue with either 2.25 or 2.26 just after restarting selenium i'm now getting this when it tries to open up firefox for testing ERROR - Failed to start new browser session, shutdown browser and clear all session data java.lang.RuntimeException: Timed out waiting for profile to be created!.  What's the correct way to clear this issue? i've deleted the user's profile directory and ensured ff will start up and access a site
[09:49:20] Manoj_: But I agree, The smattering wordpress blog does that.
[09:50:59] AutomatedTester: richardshaw: is your /tmp folder locked?
[09:51:19] AutomatedTester: richardshaw: are you telling selenium to start with a specific profile?

[10:35:22] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: the chrome devs are just trying to annoy you
[10:35:26] mbrochh: andreastt: doesn't seem to work. I don't have pressKey, so I tried key_down... it only performs the last one, so the caret moves to the right
[10:35:34] Ardesco: heh
[10:36:43] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: only performs the last one?
[10:36:45] mbrochh: Hmm... your second suggestions with send_keys works
[10:37:03] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: andreastt gave you the Java example
[10:37:06] mbrochh: this is what worked for me: ActionChains(self.selenium).send_keys(Keys.COMMAND, Keys.SHIFT, Keys.ARROW_RIGHT).perform()
[10:37:20] mbrochh: But how is that different from the driver's send_keys?
[10:37:32] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: if you do it that way then you dont need action chains
[10:37:58] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: if you want to chain tasks together then its better to use action chains
[10:38:53] richardshaw: AutomatedTester: did you have any further ideas about the firefox profile issue i was having?

[11:08:11] AutomatedTester: rp21: thats exactly when to use action chains
[11:08:22] AutomatedTester: if its just typing then you dont always need action chains
[11:09:42] rp21: i haven't tested whether the click() is relevant there.

[11:39:42] AutomatedTester: but expired certs are unhandled
[11:40:34] capola: thanks AutomatedTester , last year i tried and had lots of issues trying to get unsigned certs , and getting it to use a firefox profile with a plugin for automatically accepting these certs.
[11:41:07] AutomatedTester: capola: that only works in Firefox and Chrome iirc though
[11:41:21] capola: I am only testing firefox on linux
[11:41:34] AutomatedTester: we have supported self-signed certs for a while

[11:43:20] Moo^_^: but the process should be the same for any pre-loaded profile
[11:44:35] AutomatedTester: as I say, thats only if your cert is really borked

[12:21:36] AutomatedTester: capola: it depends. If you are going to use the web element a couple times on the page then store it
[12:22:02] capola: not for a login

[15:32:30] barancev: what the heck? go test-rc can't stop the browser after the last test
[15:33:52] barancev: but when I closó it manually, test marked passed
[15:38:52] mbrochh: AutomatedTester: you were right. Cut and Paste via send_keys(Keys.CONTROL, 'x') works in Ubuntu.
[15:39:02] mbrochh: Fucking OSX. NOTHING works on OSX out of the box.
[15:39:31] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: we are rewriting FirefoxDriver atm
[15:39:34] Dude-X: technically os x uses command x but i don't know if they map the same way
[15:39:50] AutomatedTester: and it should work when I am finished with that
[15:40:13] AutomatedTester: s/I am/My team are/
[15:40:40] mbrochh: cool. so is FirefoxDriver generally a better choice to use? Because right now I was using ChromeDriver
[15:40:52] richardshaw: Dude-X: don't use OSX, use a VM
[15:41:11] AutomatedTester: mbrochh: I am the wrong person to ask since I work for Mozilla and my answer is biased :)
[15:41:19] Dude-X: i'm not the one with an issue :)
[15:41:22] mbrochh: richardshaw: it took me a long time but now i got OSX configured nicely and I like it much much more than Ubuntu
[15:41:23] Dude-X: but i do use OS X....
[15:41:45] Dude-X: so far, i don't need to worry about automating key presses
[15:41:47] richardshaw: sticking everything in a vagrant VM is far less hassle
[15:42:02] AutomatedTester: I <3 Vagrant
[15:42:20] chrisculver701: mbrochh: i find firefox is the most consistent browser to test
[15:42:21] Dude-X: vagrant vm?

[15:42:39] richardshaw: vagrantup.com
[15:42:46] mbrochh: chrisculver701: ok thanks, I will give it a try with firefox on OSX again, tomorrow
[15:43:09] chrisculver701: right on, hope it goes well
[15:43:15] mbrochh: I tried to use vagrant when I found out about the codereview tool barkeep. it didn't work AT ALL on OSX :)
[15:43:22] chrisculver701: be warned, i'm speaking from a windows platform though
[15:43:48] Dude-X: i'm not a fan of virtualbox it's uber crashy on mac os x
[15:44:05] richardshaw: Dude-X: it is :) a new version every week
[15:44:15] richardshaw: they'll get stability eventually
[15:44:23] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: the vagrant team are working to have it work with all VM solutions
[15:45:07] Dude-X: i am aware of that, but it's taking a whileâ€¦. hopefully they'll get vmware fusion support ready (though i use parallels at home)

[15:47:17] mbrochh: i don't quite understand vagrant
[15:47:41] mbrochh: from the tutorial it seems as if the vagrant boxes that you setup are servers
[15:47:45] mbrochh: without desctops
[15:48:04] mbrochh: so you would ssh into the machine
[15:48:19] richardshaw: they are, they're headless.  They present a mapped folder to your machine which you point your IDE at
[15:49:05] richardshaw: you're basically compartmentalising your dev stack without touching your base OS, but developing as if it was setup on your base OS

[16:06:50] h8R_at_work: Hello, guys. I have a strange problem with selenium. On our windows Xp workstations, happends sometimes, somehow, Selenium skips some letters when sending text to input fields. On that time the process is very slow. Selenium sends the letters very slow.. 
[16:06:51] h8R_at_work: What can cause this? 
[16:07:26] h8R_at_work: Its not from Java version, because since we use it, there were several java updates
[16:07:40] AutomatedTester: the browser could be really slow in processing what we sent
[16:07:59] AutomatedTester: it thinks its done it all but its not doing it
[16:08:18] AutomatedTester: tbh without more info its hard to say
[16:08:26] h8R_at_work: i can provide more info, i need to debug this
[16:08:39] h8R_at_work: the worst part it that this is not regular problem.
[16:08:53] AutomatedTester: when it happens is the machine under load?
[16:09:00] AutomatedTester: e.g. are there a lot of browsers open
[16:09:04] h8R_at_work: yep
[16:09:15] h8R_at_work: no, single window
[16:09:27] AutomatedTester: but they are under load
[16:09:28] AutomatedTester: ?
[16:09:37] h8R_at_work: there is +1 browser opened, but its Chrome, and we're using Firefox for the tests
[16:09:43] h8R_at_work: the whole machine is under load
[16:10:07] AutomatedTester: are these vms or real machines?
[16:10:12] h8R_at_work: real machines
[16:11:26] AutomatedTester: tbh, if the machines are under load that could be the cause
[16:11:36] h8R_at_work: doh
[16:11:43] AutomatedTester: we try tell the browser we need to following keys to be sent
[16:12:51] h8R_at_work: they are workstations, happends there is a user working while the tests are working
[16:12:53] AutomatedTester: we then tell it after each key that the following events need to be fired
[16:13:09] AutomatedTester: somewhere in all of this, if the machine is struggling to do its initial tasks then Selenium, and you  by proxy, are going to have a bad time
[16:13:21] h8R_at_work: i see
[16:13:37] h8R_at_work: so if the computer is under load, probably selenium will skip letters
[16:13:57] AutomatedTester: it *could* skip letters
[16:14:01] h8R_at_work: is there anything i can do to assure there is enought memory for selenium?
[16:14:35] AutomatedTester: are people typing at these machines when this happens?
[16:15:13] h8R_at_work: yep, happends to work on Chrome
[16:15:24] h8R_at_work: while tests are working on Firefox
[16:18:13] h8R_at_work: is a problem if they are typing in this moment
[16:18:27] AutomatedTester: Firefox tries to gain focus
[16:18:45] AutomatedTester: so also wondering if they are pressing backspace
[16:30:21] h8R_at_work: AutomatedTester: yep, probably they are

[19:41:01] h8R_at_work: and if there is a link, i use the font-size style as "anchor"
[19:41:29] Dude-X: h8R_at_work: shouldn't they use css in a separate file?
