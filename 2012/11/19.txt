[13:04:44] AnixG: Hey Adam, Great to know it works on Jellybean too. Had this doubt as I didn't see native Android Browser in Nexus 7
[13:06:57] dawagner: jarib: I've filed a ticket with our host
[13:07:18] dawagner: freynaud: What problem are you seeing? It should Just Work, but we also don't currently test the atoms for an iOS platform
[13:07:22] dawagner: It works in safari, though
[13:11:01] freynaud: dawagner:  it sets the value, but doesn't fire all the events
[13:11:40] dawagner: What events are missing?
[13:11:54] freynaud: at least key up
[13:12:06] freynaud: it fails FormHandlingTest#testShouldBeAbleToEnterTextIntoATextAreaBySettingItsValue for instance
[13:12:29] dawagner: Interesting...
[13:12:34] freynaud: I've had that issue, and one with getAttribute
[13:12:44] aweiteka has joined #selenium
[13:12:44] dawagner: Sounds like we bugs in the atoms ;)
[13:12:52] freynaud: if an input has an original value="X"
[13:13:10] freynaud: and I enter some other text, it still returns X
[13:13:43] freynaud: the rest was surprisingly easy to plug in. Made a lot of tests passing
[13:13:49] dawagner: Woo
[13:13:54] dawagner: Well, to debug failures:
[13:14:15] freynaud: so far, I'm focusing on having the suite passing, so I used native event instead
[13:14:23] dawagner: javascript/atoms/tests has small tests in
[13:14:37] dawagner: ./go debug-server will start an HTTP server on localhost:2310
[13:14:53] dawagner: If you navigate to localhost:2310/javascript/atoms/tests it will give you a list of tests
[13:14:58] freynaud: ok
[13:15:25] dawagner: Click on one and it will run the tests, and you can interactively debug, F5 etc works
[13:15:53] freynaud: cool
[13:21:43] freynaud: is WritingNewDrivers on the wiki  still valid ?
[13:24:20] nirvdrum: Finally upgraded to 2.26.0 and the Firefox 3.6 SSL issue is still present.  I guess I'm actually going to have to file an issue with a test case.  How quaint.

[14:22:29] nirvdrum: It broke somewhere between 2.24 -> 2.25.
[14:22:34] nirvdrum: IIRC.
[14:22:48] nirvdrum: Actually, I think it broke post 2.25.  I need to double-check that.
[14:23:04] dawagner: 2.25 -> 2.26 was a lot of changes
[14:23:18] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[14:23:40] nirvdrum: It's a bit annoying in that using BrowserMob Proxy doesn't even gain you anything because Firefox won't accept the cybervillains cert.
[14:24:47] dawagner: nirvdrum: Try https://gist.github.com/4110995
[14:25:36] nirvdrum: Will do.  I won't be able to get to it for a bit yet though.
[14:26:04] nirvdrum: I guess another option is using a custom profile to add the cybervillains cert, since I'm using BMP for everything anyway.

[15:25:39] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[15:28:16] adamgoucher: nevermind; either if valid -- http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#strings 
[15:29:23] adamgoucher: just be careful which one you choose with which language since some (ruby, php, perl) will do magic to strings depending
[15:32:02] dude-x: using python
[15:32:12] dude-x: i don't think python tampers with strings
[15:33:18] dude-x: adamgoucher: i may have to do some automation against gmailâ€¦. is it easier to interact with html only version of gmail? (need to verify our email templates are proper depending on the state of user actions)

[15:39:08] dude-x: hmm that could work
[15:39:54] dude-x: i wonder if i can use a python imap library against gmail
[15:41:04] adamgoucher: the trick is to avoid the gmail ui /at all costs/ -- there is waaaay too much magic going on to synchronize properly without knowing all the latches they use
[15:41:25] RossPatterson: dude-x: Sure - it's a very good IMAP server.
[15:41:39] RossPatterson: adamgoucher: Eggzactly
[15:42:00] dude-x: next question is: what's a good imap lib for python? is it in the standard library? is the api friendly like requests?
[15:42:07] RossPatterson: But on the up side, when automating GMail you get to learn every trick and quirk in the book.
[15:42:20] adamgoucher: if its in the standard library, its likely not api friendly :D
[15:43:15] dude-x: i might play with the html version of gmail on a weekend
[15:43:17] adamgoucher: dude-x: heres the entrance to the rabbit hole http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=imap&submit=search
[15:44:50] adamgoucher: actually, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/imapIO/0.9.5 doesnt look so bad

[16:33:08] FalCone: Hey. I'm using webdriver, how do I get just the tags of an element that I have found and put into an array?
[16:33:26] FalCone: Easy question, I'm guessing. Python binding documentation is all jumbly.
[16:34:50] jibay has joined #selenium
[16:36:38] jimevans: FalCone: i'm not sure I follow. you've found an element, and you want to get the "tags" of it?
[16:36:53] FalCone: like, I'm pulling every iframe
[16:37:06] jimevans: so you're finding multiple elements, not one.
[16:37:20] FalCone: so I wanna just grab the tag test <iframe height="blah" width="blah" src=whatever></iframe?
[16:37:21] FalCone: >
[16:37:21] FalCone: c
[16:37:27] FalCone: But I'm looking at each of them in a loop
[16:37:39] jimevans: using find_elements, or similar?
[16:37:48] FalCone: Yeah
[16:38:11] jimevans: but you want the actual HTML source? a WebElement can't give you that directly.
[16:38:17] FalCone: Huh.
[16:38:43] FalCone: Can I get parameters of those elements?
[16:38:49] jimevans: it might be more useful to know why you want that. you may be approaching your goal the wrong way.
[16:39:23] FalCone: I'm trying to extract the srcs of anchor and iframe tags
[16:39:42] jimevans: then i thing get_attribute will work for you.
[16:39:49] jimevans: s/thing/think/
[16:40:10] *jimevans doesn't know python worth a damn, but the api is pretty similar along all language bindings.
[16:40:14] FalCone: Yeah, it is
[16:40:23] adamgoucher: srcs = [i.get_attribue('src') for i in driver.find_element_by_tag_name('iframe')]
[16:40:24] stephend has joined #selenium
[16:41:02] FalCone: Yeah, that's kind of what I was thinking. I just wanted to know if I could look at the tags, too.
[16:41:04] jimevans: FalCone: note, though that get_attribute will normalize 'src' attributes to be absolute URLs, so if you're using relative urls there, and it's important to capture that, you'll need to drop to javascript.
[16:41:05] FalCone: For debugging purposes.
[16:41:10] DAN- has joined #selenium
[16:41:16] FalCone: Yeah, I'd imagine.
[16:41:45] FalCone: if I can get the srcs, I can just check if they're absolute or not before I do anything funky with them.
[16:41:54] DAN-: hi all :) can anyone here help me out with setting a password protected proxy in FirefoxProxy() ?
[16:42:19] jimevans: FalCone: no, you're misunderstanding me. calling get_attribute() you'll *always* get absolute urls for the src attribute.
[16:42:35] jimevans: no matter what they actually are in the html source code.
[16:42:45] FalCone: oh
[16:42:49] FalCone: sorry. Literacy rates, etc.
[16:42:58] adamgoucher: heh. i think the solution for this is â€¦ wait for it â€¦ the js executor then
[16:43:12] jimevans: adamgoucher: top marks, my friend. :)
[16:43:30] adamgoucher: not a week goes by where i abuse that now :D

[18:26:35] DAN-: adamgoucher, can i use a proxy pac file to pass credentials?
[18:26:43] adamgoucher: nope
[18:27:38] adamgoucher: in firefox, it looks like you can avoid getting prompted if you you have them correctly set and signon.autologin.proxy is set to true
[18:28:17] DAN-: hmm.. any idea how I can automate filling in the username/password when prompted then?
[18:28:37] DAN-: I don't care about security I just need to authenticate with the proxy before running the tests
[18:30:34] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[18:30:37] adamgoucher: either a custom profile where you tweak things the way you want or drop to the shell to run some sort of windows-driving app to do it.
[18:30:52] adamgoucher: (or get a proxy you dont have to authenticate to in order to get to your app)
[18:32:45] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[18:33:06] DAN-: Ehh i'll have to chain proxies then... create a proxy server running localy which does not require authentication, then send commands to the proxy on which proxy to chain to + authentication
[18:33:50] adamgoucher: or get an environment where accessing machines isnt seen as a point of non-trust :)
[18:34:56] DAN-: haha wish me luck with that :P

[18:36:09] DAN-: can't beleive web driver cant do something this simple
[18:37:21] jimevans: random observation: "something this simple," rarely is.
[18:37:54] adamgoucher: the passwords are stored in the password manager. if it was in a pref it would be easy-peasy
[18:39:58] DAN-: true true :) but if you had to connect to a proxy directly from java you'd send the username:password@host:port or something similar and you're in. In the end the credentials are still going over the wire in plain text so I can't see why an application like firefox won't let me set something like http.proxy.username=username and http.proxy.password=password -- sometimes you care about security other times you just wanna get around it :)

[18:46:52] DAN-: yep.. in fact I had to use FireFoxProfile to connect to an open proxy (and this works)

[18:47:09] DAN-: it's the credentials part I can't seem to get around nicely
[18:47:56] DAN-: I really dont want to end up having to chain proxies coz this will slow down the tests significantly
[18:48:23] adamgoucher: can you run them from the other side of the proxy when speed matters?
[18:50:14] DAN-: nope, it's now allowed the thing is I need to use different proxies when testing different parts of the application ... all of which require authentication

[18:53:06] KaibutsuX: html from the request
[18:53:14] KaibutsuX: getPageSource is built from the dom
[18:53:39] adamgoucher: does the browsermob proxy not tell you that? (can't remember)

[18:58:57] cmiles74: Hello. :) Is there an easy way to test a ModalWindow with Selenium (using WebDriver)? I can't seem to get a handle on the modal window itself.
[18:59:09] jarib: KaibutsuX: why?
[18:59:11] KaibutsuX: we currently have a simple script that curls urls, but it's a CF of about 4,000 urls with no management and we want to move away from it
[18:59:32] KaibutsuX: because our source shouldn't change unless we have data changes
[18:59:57] jarib: KaibutsuX: if you can get at all the pages with curl, selenium is not what you need
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Nov 19 19:00:29 2012]
[19:00:29] adamgoucher: so you want to moved from one disaster to another? for this i would use python with requests and build whatever management you want around that
[19:00:31] KaibutsuX: we are already using selenium , have been for two years now, we want to supplement it with more testing
[19:00:50] KaibutsuX: yes, our port from curl will be a simple urrllib script
[19:01:02] adamgoucher: dont use urllib. use requests.
[19:01:08] KaibutsuX: but we also want to detect source changes on certain poages
[19:01:49] KaibutsuX: well, whatever if simplest really, all ive used so far is urllib
[19:02:28] adamgoucher: so the browsermob cache produces har files which you can interrogate to get the response/text
[19:02:34] cmiles74: I set the ID on the modal window's form to something I can rely on, waiting for the element waits but then never finds the element.

[21:03:04] dude-x: something similar to //div[contains(text(), 'blah')]
[21:03:07] jimevans: dude-x: it's all xpath? that doesn't sound right. should be delegating down to javascript, which at the lowest level should be doing getElementsByTagName() where supported.
[21:03:37] KaibutsuX: dude-x not that I know of. You could regex it for anything inside of tags
[21:03:41] dude-x: if you use getElementByTagName or ClassName it uses xpath
[21:04:09] jimevans: dude-x: not to be obtuse, but could you point me to that in the source?

[21:08:46] jimevans: dude-x: i think you're reading that wrong. it degrades to using xpath if and only if the driver instance doesn't implement the FindsByTagName interface.
[21:09:06] dude-x: ah

[21:35:49] jleyba: jimevans: pretty sure that's essentially what ken has proposed for chromedriver 2.0

[21:38:42] Ardesco_H: Safari has a tiny market share as it is#
[21:38:56] jleyba: jimevans: Yes it would work for OSX
[21:39:53] jimevans: and it has nifty mobile implications, if i read the proposal correctly.
[21:41:19] jleyba: actually, i can't find anything about how to enable the remote debugger for safari

[23:16:47] shti: hi everyone. i know there is a number of articles on google about this but i'm fairly new to selenium and just wanted to see what everyone thought -- what's the best way to go about running multiple selenium server's on the same server while keeping cookies/sessions isolated? would like to avoid using "grid"
[23:17:56] adamgoucher: why multiple servers? you can have a server serve multiple things -- the problem is clashes with things like ie and only one config
[23:20:25] shti: i'm running this on ubuntu. i need to be able to parallelize what i'm doing but not to the extreme of using selenium grid, so i basically just need a few instances to throw jobs at
[23:21:21] shti: the other requirements i have are that i can load seperate profiles in each firefox instance and keep cookies seperate

[23:39:42] adamgoucher: nope
[23:39:51] FalCone: So the only way to go is back up?
[23:39:53] FalCone: to the top?
[23:40:27] adamgoucher: switch_to_frame, do stuff, switch_to_default_context, find your frame, switch_to_it
[23:41:21] adamgoucher: (wrappign that up in a convienience method high up in your page model akin to switch_to_frame_called(name) or something so you dont have to remember it all)
[23:42:36] FalCone: blah. So if I'm iterating on an array of frames and doing stuff in there, can I take the frame that I'm coming from and save that for when I'm done iterating with each frame?
[23:42:57] FalCone: like a recursive function that takes in a frame, that could go into some frames inside that frame
[23:42:59] FalCone: frame-ception
[23:44:24] FalCone: or if I'm in focus in one frame, can Iswitch out to another frame above it by having the webelement handy?
