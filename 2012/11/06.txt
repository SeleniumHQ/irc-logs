[13:36:55] tonylampada: I'm looking at http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs#Future_Work
[13:37:06] tonylampada: I mean http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs
[13:37:13] AutomatedTester: tonylampada: with a server side JS and a server-side JS test runner
[13:37:47] mreedell has joined #selenium
[13:37:48] tonylampada: AutomatedTester: Can you point me to some documentation describing how to set this up?
[13:38:05] AutomatedTester: :google visionmedia mocha
[13:38:06] selbot2: visionmedia/mocha · GitHub: https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha
[13:38:25] AutomatedTester: tonylampada: ^ thats a good serverside JS test runner
[13:40:00] tonylampada: Thanks, I'm looking into it :-)
[13:40:34] tonylampada: I have another question actually! hehe
[13:41:12] tonylampada: Have you ever done selenium tests with javascript. Is it a good option?
[13:41:24] tonylampada: I mean, selenium has a blocking nature
[13:41:34] tonylampada: And javascript is purely asynchronous
[13:41:59] jimevans has joined #selenium
[13:42:10] AutomatedTester: webdriverjs uses Promises so it gives the feel of synchronous code
[13:42:57] tonylampada: AutomatedTester: Yes, a question about promises:
[13:43:09] AutomatedTester: tonylampada: https://github.com/AutomatedTester/powerball-platform/blob/master/tests/ui_tests.js is an example using Mocha
[13:43:37] tonylampada: AutomatedTester: Ah beatyfull, thanks!!
[13:43:55] tonylampada: I'm looking at this code using promises:
[13:44:01] tonylampada: driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('user')).sendKeys('bugs');     driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('pw')).sendKeys('bunny');
[13:44:15] tonylampada: If I changed it into:
[13:45:17] tonylampada: var _usr = driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('user'));  var _drv = driver.findElement(webdriver.By.id('pw'));  _usr.sendKeys('bugs');  _drv.sendKeys('bunny'); 
[13:45:27] tonylampada: would it still work as expected?
[13:45:41] tonylampada: (I'm guessing no - is that correct?)
[13:45:41] AutomatedTester: *should*
[13:45:56] AutomatedTester: it *should* just work
[13:46:33] AutomatedTester: the person who wrote it wanted to try keep the synchronous look and feel of the code in webdriverjs
[13:46:46] tonylampada: ok, I still need to understand promises better then :-)
[13:46:46] AutomatedTester: internally it just queues up the commands and runs them in order
[13:47:02] AutomatedTester: Promises are magical
[13:47:06] AutomatedTester: :)
[13:47:57] tonylampada: hehe. Yeah, I got thanks. 
[13:48:11] tonylampada: But people fear what they don't understand :-)

[14:10:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: hmm not sure about that. I know I will write a test to check :)
[14:10:45] jimevans: in your getTransformValues() function, you mention that the values for x and y for the transform matrix have the form '0px', and return those as x and y properties of your object, but when you compare them to a value, you're comparing them to numeric value 0.
[14:11:06] jimevans: so i don't know if that'll work or not. :)

[14:17:06] AutomatedTester: bfife: Chrome is the only browser to still have a prefix on transform
[14:17:06] *jimevans clears the IE browser cache.
[14:17:18] AutomatedTester: with latest browsers
[14:18:45] jimevans: okay, i've verified that those tests are passing. i must've had a giltch of some kind.

[14:19:47] jimevans: CI will tell the story. it'll run the atoms tests on IE9. :)
[14:19:51] AutomatedTester: if you know that it can be done
[14:20:04] AutomatedTester: jimevans: do we trust our CI again?
[14:20:19] jimevans: (and 10, for that matter, but we're waiting for google atoms updates there)
[14:20:39] jimevans: AutomatedTester: for javascript tests? yes, as long as the tests don't timeout downloading the selenium jar.
[14:21:01] jimevans: actually, for all tests except for native events tests for firefox on linux.
[14:21:31] rp2: my sendKeys() is failing with Chrome ... on a <canvas/> element, it says it cannot focus on it. FF has no problem with it
[14:22:07] bfife: rp2: does it try to focus on a different element?
[14:22:20] rp2: I have no idea
[14:22:26] rp2: how do I find out?

[14:22:53] rp2: this looks like issue http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=440 except it isn't fixed (I've configured Maven to always use the latest Selenium)
[14:23:00] dawagner: AIUI closure doesn't do that, but the individual browsers are starting to
[14:23:47] *dawagner tries to remember what the last code he wrote to do this did...
[14:24:57] AutomatedTester: dawagner: Chrome and Firefox dont do that

[14:26:35] dawagner: IIRC they pushed something at the W3C which only they implement
[14:26:46] bfife: rp2: alright, was thinking it might be related to a diff issue
[14:27:03] bfife: chrome doesnt like clicking elements on the pages we're building so i have to use an actionchain
[14:27:16] dawagner: One of the problems is the format returned from querying transform is fscking crazy; sometimes it's matrices, sometimes it's concatenated "translate(?); rotate(?)", etc
[14:27:50] rp2: e.isSelected() is false, but I'm not sure if that's relevant (its documentation says it doesn't apply to canvas elements)
[14:28:03] rp2: hmm
[14:28:06] bfife: what about isVisible ?
[14:28:14] rp2: an action chain ... i read about those once
[14:28:28] AutomatedTester: jimevans: damn you for being right! :)
[14:28:28] rp2: it isVisible() 
[14:28:38] rp2: but not isSeleced()

[14:58:13] dawagner: And sometimes they decide to or not to
[14:58:28] dawagner: IIRC Chrome 21 -> 22 changed whether they do or not, but only in some circumstances

[15:34:41] andreastt: dawagner: So checking an argument in a builder pattern should happen when constructing the object, not when using the setter, right?
[15:38:56] jarib has joined #selenium
[15:40:20] dawagner: andreastt: Depends what you're doing...
[15:40:38] dawagner: I generally prefer blowing up in the setter, keeping the error and stack trace close to the call which caused a problem
[15:40:59] dawagner: Unless you can't know it's a problem until build time, or can fall back, or something

[16:17:42] barancev: jimevans: according to the documentation of WebDriver.get -- "This is done using an HTTP GET operation, and the method will block until the load is complete"
[16:17:57] barancev: but we all know that in IE it is not blocking
[16:18:05] jimevans: barancev: i'm sorry, what?
[16:18:19] barancev: at least, it is "less blocking" than in other browsers
[16:18:27] barancev: should not we change the documentation?
[16:19:34] jimevans: that's not up to me. it's also dependent on the page load strategy (which isn't yet implemented by IE, but is specified in the W3C spec)
[16:20:23] barancev: many people think WebDriver.get is blocking, but it is not, in IE
[16:20:24] jimevans: plus, IE does block, at least until the conditions it's waiting for have been fulfilled. :)

[16:29:57] jimevans: barancev: sorry. i just can't get worked up about the issue. i've done the best i know how to make the IE driver behave the way everyone thinks it should. IE will block on a navigation until all of the things it knows how to look for are done. if a page meets those criteria (and ajax-heavy pages may before the user interprets the load as "done"), it'll release the block. the wait code is in Browser::Wait() (Browser.cpp, line 369). if you have ideas how
[16:29:57] jimevans: make it conform better, i'll gladly review your patch. 
[16:30:49] barancev: jimevans: I suggest to declare it "non-blocking" :)

[17:24:06] lukeis: Ardesco: would it make sense to instead change how HexConverter takes arguments? .. After looking at what's public / what not, maybe a new method Color.fromStringAndAlpha(String str, Double alpha)?
[17:24:37] lukeis: solofight_: then you'll need to find the hidden text input field, make it visible and send_keys to that

[17:27:30] solofight_: Ardesco: thanks for replying
[17:27:48] solofight_: lukeis: just viewed the source code - there is no hidden input type = "file"
[17:27:49] solofight_: !
[17:27:52] lukeis: Ardesco: the reason why I'm hesitant on the patch still is a color is a color when constructed, I like to consider it immutable. Yeah, I see how it does with the string, obviously the case with hex + alpha isn't taken care of
[17:28:08] Ardesco: Could add a new fromString that takes a string and an alpha
[17:28:15] Ardesco: but that seemed to be not as neat
[17:28:16] lukeis: :)
[17:28:19] solofight_: lukeis: is it positive ? that the only way ?
[17:29:03] lukeis: solofight_: if they are a web site and not using something like a java applet, there WILL be a file input somewhereâ€¦ it might even get created after 'clicking' it, in which case you're in a bad situation
[17:29:44] lukeis: if you're in that bad situation you'll have to write some javascript to bypass the mechanism on the page and create your own file input element with the same name and add it to the form
[17:30:21] jimevans has left #selenium
[17:30:55] Ardesco: So options for that patch as I see it are:
[17:31:36] Ardesco: leave as is so you can add the alpha afterwards, this would allow you to retrospectively apply an alpha for anything, but would be of most use with a hex/hex3 or a standard rgb
[17:32:08] Ardesco: add a new fromString function that only accepts hex/hex3 (maybe rgb) that allows you to also specify an alpha
[17:32:29] smccarthy2 has joined #selenium
[17:32:36] Ardesco: add some sort of munged convertor that allows you to add an alpha on the end of a hex (sounds nasty and prone to error)
[17:33:12] Ardesco: or just bin the idea as something that shouldn't be in the support package
[17:33:13] lukeis: or maybe you could change your patch a bit so that we take care of if the alpha was present it can't be re-set by your new method
[17:33:24] Ardesco: could do
[17:33:54] Ardesco: how would I know it hadn't been set tho
[17:34:01] Ardesco: assume it can bet set if it's 1
[17:34:20] Ardesco: but that would allow you to set an alpha for anything that has 1 as an alpha
[17:34:38] lukeis: hmm, would probably need to change that to null as default
[17:34:38] Ardesco: (thinking aloud here )
[17:34:42] lukeis: yep
[17:34:58] Ardesco: but by default the alpha is not null, it is legitimately 1
[17:35:07] ner0x has joined #selenium
[17:35:08] Ardesco: as 1 is a solid colour
[17:35:26] lukeis: :-/
[17:35:34] Ardesco: so all RGB/Hex with no alpha specified should always return a 1 if converted into a format where alpha is supported

[17:38:39] lukeis: maybe asking daniel what he thinks would be appropriate

[17:40:24] Ardesco: of course it may not be appropriate at all, it's just a bit of a pain to create colour objects with opacity if you have a hex and an opacity atm

[21:04:30] Dude-X: anyone familiar with basic javscript? i have an element that's hidden until it's exposed by a mouse hover
[21:04:52] Dude-X: how can i show the element? I don't know what Facebook uses for a js toolkit
[21:05:21] Dude-X: synthetic actiion chains is not working for 'move_to_element'
[21:06:17] alexglow has joined #selenium
[21:07:18] lukeis: Dude-X: can you not just set the element's style?
[21:07:50] lukeis: "arguments[0].style.display = 'block'", element  <- or whatever other style you may need to set
[21:08:58] Dude-X: i'll try that
[21:14:06] AutomatedTester: holy github is slow batman
[21:14:27] lukeis: was working fine for me a min ago
[21:14:40] lukeis: you must be on another continent or something
[21:15:36] Dude-X: doesn't work lukeis
[21:15:53] lukeis: then you have something else happening to make it visible
[21:16:04] *lukeis can only help by seeing the page
[21:16:21] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: watch the class='' when you hover over
[21:16:28] AutomatedTester: and then track down what its doing
[21:16:35] lukeis: sometimes they also like to use :hover
[21:16:48] AutomatedTester: or that
[21:16:57] Dude-X: it's a :hover
[21:17:06] Fyre: heh good luck then
[21:17:10] AutomatedTester: ahh then you need native events
[21:17:12] lukeis: then look in the css rules for how it's transforming the style
[21:17:13] Fyre: i now manually check :hover things
[21:17:22] AutomatedTester: and there is a bug on persisting hover
[21:19:00] lukeis: which bug?
[21:19:34] AutomatedTester: our sheriff barancev will know it
[21:19:38] Ardesco_H: My experience so far is that you can't trigger :hover if you aren't using native events
[21:20:08] Dude-X: okay if i don't want to hover, but just activate the link
[21:20:10] AutomatedTester: Ardesco_H: is that you cant trigger :hover unless you are using native events?
[21:20:15] Dude-X: how can i do it via javascript
[21:20:24] Swadq has joined #selenium
[21:20:29] Ardesco_H: i haven't found a way to trigger :hover with javascript yet
[21:20:31] AutomatedTester: you double negative scared me there
[21:20:41] Ardesco_H: sorry :)
[21:21:22] Ardesco_H: how about, you can only trigger hover with native events
[21:21:23] Ardesco_H: :)
[21:21:33] *AutomatedTester high fives Ardesco_H
[21:21:42] Ardesco_H: you can do masty stuff like get the element location and then use a Java robot class to move the mouse there
[21:21:47] Ardesco_H: but it's a bit hacky for me
[21:21:54] Ardesco_H: i just manually check them
[21:22:32] lukeis: Dude-X: you can try to look at the css files and see how the :hover rules are adjust the style of the elements (firebug / chrome inspector should be able to show you when you mouse over)
[21:22:36] Ardesco_H: when all driver support native events in all OS's I may start automating them
[21:23:09] Ardesco_H: lukeis, the problem is triggering the damn event without native events
[21:23:12] Dude-X: i wish i can remove apps from facebook, waaa
[21:23:25] lukeis: Ardesco_H: i'm not recommending triggering any event ;)
[21:23:33] Ardesco_H: oh ok :)
[21:23:52] *lukeis goes to javascript execute_script all too quicklyâ€¦ 
[21:24:06] lukeis: and uses it to adjust styles of elements so i can click them ;)
[21:24:18] Ardesco_H: i've fallen into a fair bit of that recently, I blame the google maps API and canvas personally
[21:24:39] Ardesco_H: I don't go as far as manipulating elements though
[21:24:42] Dude-X: lukeis: how can i apply a class to an element using raw javascript
[21:25:04] lukeis: "arguments[0].className = 'my new classes'", element
[21:25:28] *lukeis has to remember if that is cross browser or not
[21:25:41] Dude-X: lukeis: will it append or replace?
[21:25:44] lukeis: replace
[21:25:59] *Dude-X q-berts
[21:26:14] lukeis: 'arguments[0].className = arguments[0].className  + "appendName"'
[21:26:25] lukeis: " appendName"
[21:26:28] Dude-X: ah nice
[21:27:39] lukeis: if jQuery is on the page you can do it like $(arguments[0]).class('name') or something like that
[21:28:33] *lukeis is getting rusty on my jQuery, need to work on a project with that agin
[21:29:24] Dude-X: jQuery is not on facebook 
[21:29:32] Dude-X: otherwise it woudl be a snap
[21:29:50] lukeis: jimevans is going to help determine if obama is gonna be president ;)  http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html
[21:30:04] lukeis: so awesome to see how florida is a major decider of the election
[21:30:42] lukeis: if only we did popular vote, we wouldn't have a republican president again for a looooong time ;)
[21:30:42] Dude-X: again...
[21:31:30] Dude-X: i think gwb won 2004 with popular voteâ€¦ putting aside the lost ballots
[21:31:43] Dude-X: lukeis: i'm one step closer....
[21:31:57] Dude-X: i made the remove button look different but it's not quite visible yet
[21:32:43] *lukeis is thinking about buying a condo in florida just so I can register to vote there for the presidential elections ;)
[21:33:51] Dude-X: downside you'd be living in Florida
[21:34:15] lukeis: *condo* I would not move, likely just rent it out on 3 year leases ;)
[21:34:36] lukeis: and you can find some cheap ones there
[21:37:27] Dude-X: lukeis: is it possible to manipulate CSS ? i have #my_apps .appsListItem .showOnHover that sets visibility
[21:37:46] lukeis: sets visibility how?
[21:38:04] lukeis: visibility:visible?
[21:38:13] Dude-X: yeah
[21:38:33] lukeis: then you can set it
[21:38:42] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[21:38:43] lukeis: arguments[0].style.visibility = 'visible'
[21:40:01] Dude-X: yes that worked
[21:40:19] Ardesco_H: gah why, whebever there is an xpath question, does somebody wade in with "Use CSS locators!!!"
[21:40:29] Dude-X: lukeis: you're my hero. if you're ever in NYC ping me
[21:40:33] Ardesco_H: It's not always the answer
[21:41:00] lukeis: Ardesco_H: it's ALWAYS the answerâ€¦ except for two cases for me ;)
[21:41:00] Dude-X: Ardesco_H: for my purpose, it's exactly what I need
[21:41:24] Dude-X: i can't rely on native events being there (or reliable :p
[21:41:46] lukeis: Dude-X: will do, i think likely i'll be in the area is seconf if it's in boston, or i may visit friends in philly
[21:41:46] Ardesco_H: refering to mailing list, not anything you have said here Dude-X 
[21:42:05] Dude-X: Ardesco_H: sorry don't mind me :P
[21:42:25] Ardesco_H: it's fine, just don't want to inadvertantly insult somebody
[21:42:27] Dude-X: Ardesco_H: ah i see your prior statemnet about xpath / css locators
[21:42:31] Ardesco_H: (i do enough of that in real life)
[21:43:05] Dude-X: Ardesco_H: actually for this facebook app thingie, i am using xpath to do //span[contains(text(), 'testwebsite')]
[21:43:17] Ardesco_H: i told somebody today that anybody who thinks they fully support HTML5 is an idiot
[21:43:21] Dude-X: that's a good way to use text()
[21:43:24] Ardesco_H: as it's a draft spec
[21:43:29] Dude-X: yeah true that
[21:43:40] Dude-X: and it's inconsistent among the latest browsers
[21:43:42] Ardesco_H: I was told indignantly that he did
[21:43:48] Ardesco_H: and had to explain the whole draft spec thing
[21:44:14] Ardesco_H: turns out he was an idiot :P
[21:45:03] Dude-X: now i have to call my paycheck procerssor to get the tracking number to my check
[21:45:09] Dude-X: why didn't they mail it via USPS?!?
[21:45:18] Dude-X: they overnighted it UPS during the hurricane
[21:45:37] lukeis: ha ;)
[21:48:42] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: why didnt they pay it straight into your account
[21:48:48] AutomatedTester: who still uses cheques?
[21:49:02] Dude-X: probably some weird law
[21:49:09] Dude-X: every first paycheck is always a physical check
[21:49:11] *AutomatedTester blames Mitt
[21:49:15] AutomatedTester: and llaskin

[21:55:56] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[21:57:03] gabrielrotbart has joined #selenium
[21:58:16] lukeis: Dude-X: that does sound like a weird NY thing, cause last two jobs i've had first paycheck was direct deposit (although last one does still have to be a check)
[21:59:08] Dude-X: my last check was direct deposit
[21:59:19] Dude-X: but my 2nd to last job it was mailed to me as a giant check
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Nov  6 22:00:32 2012]
[22:00:32] lukeis: california law makes employers pay out last check in person (physical) if given at least 3 business days notice of quitting, otherwise they have to mail it
[22:01:31] *lukeis has liked the big check when quitting and cashing in the unused vacation days ;)
[22:01:35] AutomatedTester: In the UK its illegal to give less than 1 weeks notice of being fired
[22:01:52] AutomatedTester: well Europe
[22:01:58] lukeis: california is "At-Will" so you can quit or be fired without notice
[22:02:11] AutomatedTester: yea... thats douche
[22:02:21] lukeis: meh, doesn't happen too often
[22:02:26] lukeis: well, except the firing thing
[22:02:42] Dude-X: NYS too
[22:03:19] *AutomatedTester blames Mitt again
[22:03:33] lukeis: heh
[22:08:12] wilhelm: One month minimum here. And the employer must have a valid reason.
[22:08:59] lukeis: awesome, here it's actually better to have no reason at all, otherwise they'll have grounds to sue ;)

[22:14:25] jcarr: that's a good one :)
[22:15:08] jcarr: speaking of patches, any luck with your iphone 5 work?
[22:15:35] lukeis: no, not reallyâ€¦ it's still launching small and I feel like i've reworked half of it!
[22:15:59] lukeis: figured out my linking issue at the summit
[22:16:19] *lukeis will spend some more time on it soon
[22:16:41] lukeis: right now i'm liking playing with the command line repl with appium
[22:16:41] jcarr: I wants :)
[22:17:07] lukeis: and I want a better way to start up / link in utilities on start
[22:17:50] lukeis: i've added this line in the interpreter.py for now (locally): client.proxy("function dir(e) { var s = []; for (var z in e) { s.push(z.toString()); }; s.sort(); return s.join(', '); }")
[22:18:14] lukeis: but i want to add stuff like this in a .js file or something
[22:18:15] AutomatedTester: barancev: will fix the other errors tomorrow, have cold
[22:18:20] AutomatedTester: so need sleep
[22:18:29] *AutomatedTester mutters about shitty old browsers
[22:18:32] lukeis: feel better AutomatedTester 
[22:23:03] lukeis: jcarr: any comment on the above? :)
[22:23:55] Ardesco_H: gah why does windows feel so slow compared to osx and linux?
[22:24:19] Dude-X: really i think windows is plenty fast
[22:24:29] Dude-X: well it depends on your harddrive speed
[22:24:31] Dude-X: and video card
[22:24:40] Ardesco_H: i have a cruicial m4 ssd
[22:24:43] Ardesco_H: and a

[22:24:58] Ardesco_H: GeForce GTS 560 Ti
[22:25:50] Ardesco_H: maybe it's my poor little AMD chip
[22:26:03] Ardesco_H: build faster dammit!
[22:26:06] Dude-X: Ardesco_H: maybe it's low ram? you have good stuff
[22:26:15] Dude-X: oh you're building softare on windows
[22:26:20] Dude-X: that's slow for some reason
[22:26:24] Dude-X: probably due to file system
[22:26:29] Ardesco_H: crucial ballistix
[22:26:38] Dude-X: nice ram
[22:26:38] Ardesco_H: 6gb
[22:26:48] Dude-X: you should have 16GB these days....
[22:27:43] Ardesco_H: when I can afford a nice shiney new MBPr
[22:27:45] Ardesco_H: :)
[22:29:03] Dude-X: that should have the MAX
[22:29:16] Dude-X: i want to get a new iMac and load 32GB of ram on that mother
[22:31:08] Ardesco_H: they look very nice
[22:31:25] Ardesco_H: although i think a MBPr and a couple of thunderbolt monitors will be more than enough for me
[22:31:26] Ardesco_H: :)
