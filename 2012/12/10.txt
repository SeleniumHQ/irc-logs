[05:08:15] p0deje: Anil: what's the question?
[05:08:27] Anil:  I am trying to click on an option of a select item using the webdriver api while the select item is invisible. Can someone please help me on how to do this?
[05:08:48] p0deje: hm
[05:08:56] Anil: i'm getting an exception saying that the element i'm trying to interact with is invisible
[05:09:10] p0deje: why do you want to click "invisible" select option?
[05:09:14] p0deje: i.e. what's the use case
[05:09:47] p0deje: certainly you'd be getting exception, that's expected behavior
[05:10:10] Anil: use-case is that, the select tag is visible in the website to the user, but, when i try to click the option using selenium, it says its invisible element....
[05:10:48] Anil: i've to select and verify all the options provided in the select tag, to check if the functionality is working fine or not
[05:10:58] girija has left #selenium
[05:11:17] p0deje: so, you need to get all the options?
[05:11:52] Anil: no, i need to click on the individual options of the select and then, submit...and see if the page is working for all the options of that select tag
[05:12:02] p0deje: ok, I see
[05:12:13] p0deje: hang on, I'll check how we do this in watir-webdriver
[05:12:26] Anil: i'm using firefox webdriver...
[05:14:17] p0deje: java?
[05:14:23] Anil: yes
[05:14:55] p0deje: have you tried Select - https://gist.github.com/4248599
[05:15:54] Anil: yes, thats what i did, it throws an exception saying that the element is invisible and cannot be communicated with
[05:16:26] p0deje: can you point to html where I can try?
[05:18:04] Anil: i'm testing it on this website, http://www.commonfloor.com/ and trying to click on the select tag with 'id=city'
[05:19:45] Anil: i'm trying to click on the select option 'Mumbai' and it doesn't work for me
[05:22:18] Anil: i'm using selenium-java-2.25.0.jar
[05:23:42] Anil: I tried selenium.select("xpath=//select[@id='city']","label=Mumbai");
[05:23:51] Anil: selenium.fireEvent("//select[@id='city']/option[@value='Bangalore']", "click");
[05:24:33] Anil: 		WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
[05:24:33] Anil: 		Selenium selenium = new WebDriverBackedSelenium(driver, "http://www.commonfloor.com/");
[05:24:33] Anil: 		selenium.open("/");
[05:26:31] Anil: p0deje: are you there?
[05:26:48] p0deje: Alin: yeah checking
[05:26:53] Anil: ok
[05:40:27] Anil: p0deje: any inputs for me...?
[05:41:23] p0deje: yeah
[05:41:39] p0deje: that's how it worked for me with web driver api https://gist.github.com/4248710
[05:41:46] p0deje: ruby, but I guess you'll figure it ou
[05:41:53] p0deje: s/ou/out
[05:42:26] p0deje: it won't be hard to port this to selenium 1 usage
[05:42:46] Anil: ok, so, its a two step process
[05:43:12] Anil: i.e click on the select object first, then, click on the option....righ?
[05:43:15] Anil: *right
[05:44:58] Anil: trying it out now...
[05:45:11] admc has joined #selenium
[05:48:02] p0deje: not select, it's hidden
[05:48:11] p0deje: all interactions are wrapped
[05:48:16] Anil: oh ok
[05:48:22] p0deje: so we work with divs/lis instead of select/options
[05:48:29] p0deje: since it's not native select

[14:02:03] Manoj: the thing is, the same script runs fine in IE7, IE9, FF, Chrome but not in IE 8 
[14:03:41] Manoj: Ardesco: I am even clicking on the webpage when its loaded to be on focused, but still the same error.
[14:04:35] Ardesco: get a list of window hashes when you instantiate the driver object, and a list of window hashes just before the error and see if they match
[14:04:54] Ardesco: if not something is closing/opening windows
[14:05:31] Manoj: ASAIK,  two windows are opening - One is the WebDriver default page and another is my app getting loaded...
[14:05:44] Ardesco: would switching to compatibility mode class as a window close/open
[14:06:07] Manoj: have done the compatibility viewer.... as well.
[14:06:11] Manoj: mode*
[14:06:11] Ardesco: could be the answer if so
[14:06:35] Manoj:  Changed the compatibilty View On and checked, script failed in IE8 -  Changed Compatibility View Off and checked , script failed in IE8
[14:06:53] Ardesco: i think what would be useful to do is
[14:07:00] Ardesco: get a list of window hashes when you instantiate the driver object, and a list of window hashes just before the error and see if they match
[14:07:02] Ardesco: :)
[14:07:08] Manoj: hmm ok....
[14:07:20] Manoj: handles ?
[14:08:31] Ardesco: driver.getWindowHandles()
[14:08:34] Manoj: do you have anything already done on this ? the sample code...
[14:08:44] admc has joined #selenium
[14:08:57] Manoj: yup that is what i thought :) gettingWindow handles will do..
[14:09:13] Ardesco: easiest way would be to go into debug mode set a watch on the above and step through your code
[14:09:32] Ardesco: if the set of handles changes Selenium thinks it's a new window
[14:09:54] Ardesco: or rather if a specific handle goes away selenium thinks a window has closed
[14:10:05] Ardesco: and if a new handle is added selenium thinks a new window has opened

[14:10:51] Manoj: i dont like that... :(
[14:11:18] Ardesco: ick
[14:11:55] *AutomatedTester would like to speak to the person who invented "testing with excel spreadsheets"
[14:12:10] Manoj: THanks Ardesco I will try and let you know an update later today or tomorrow.
[14:12:29] Manoj: AutomatedTester: lol , yeah even I am 
[14:13:26] Manoj: I was trouble shooting for a neighbouring team and was really... gone mad on seeing the excel sheet having functions and some text files having locators... :(
[14:13:36] Ardesco: AutomatedTester: back in the day it was a useful tool for manual testers to keep track of shit
[14:13:49] AutomatedTester: ok, let me rephrase
[14:13:59] Ardesco: now I just walk out of the room if I go to an interview and somebody asks me about using Excel as part of my day to day role
[14:14:00] Ardesco: :)
[14:14:18] AutomatedTester: I was to speak to the person who invented "Automated testing with excel spreadsheets"
[14:14:25] jds has joined #selenium
[14:14:35] Manoj: yeah, the point is the same here. The manual testers use that, but they were not able to explain what they were doing wrong. 
[14:15:02] Ardesco: hah i wasted a whole hour sitting through a talk from one of them at seconf
[14:15:02] *Ardesco was not a happy chappy
[14:15:20] Ardesco: Somebody missed the point of automation
[14:15:30] Ardesco: which is to free up manual testers to do exploratory testing so that they can find issues
[14:16:07] Manoj: THere is no learning curve to use the keyword driven framework.. where selenium do have a deep learning curve..
[14:16:19] Ardesco: not to turn manual testers into mindless data entry droids who don't do any real testing
[14:16:24] Ardesco: rubbish
[14:16:25] barancev: AutomatedTester: fit was the first, iirc. table-style test automation

[14:16:48] Ardesco: there is a big learning curve, you are just trying to hide it
[14:16:49] AutomatedTester: selenium doesnt have a steep learning curve
[14:17:02] Ardesco: the fact they have no idea what has happened when it goes wrong tells you all you need to know
[14:17:24] Manoj: Ardesco: exactly.
[14:17:35] Ardesco: manual testers shouldn't be mindlessly putting "keywords" into excel sheets
[14:17:47] Ardesco: they should be doing what manual testers are good at
[14:17:53] barancev: http://fit.c2.com/
[14:17:57] Ardesco: exploring the site/program and finding bugs
[14:18:18] *Ardesco goes off on a rant

[14:19:32] Ardesco: i would rant on my blog later

[17:26:06] admc has joined #selenium
[17:26:23] santiycr: it's Sauce Manual, out of your browser and into a native mac app
[17:26:42] lukeis: people like having *easy* was to test their website (manually, UI devs especially) in as many browsers as possibleâ€¦ this is definitely one of those *easy* ways to do that
[17:26:47] santiycr: nothing crazy innovative, considering Sauce Manual it's been around for over a year
[17:27:13] santiycr: but the usability of having it be a dedicated app seems to have clicked in people
[17:27:32] dude-x: i didn't know sauce even offered that
[17:27:33] barancev: santiycr: at the same time Chrome on linux started to fail, Firefox 10 Win7 Native Java Tests became green

[17:29:50] santiycr: dawagner, barancev been working caching last week!! Didn't get it to effing work
[17:30:17] santiycr: dawagner:  the squid config you sent me didn't work for me
[17:30:32] santiycr: my test was:
[17:30:42] santiycr: - start squid with the config
[17:30:47] santiycr: - curl a jar from S3
[17:31:00] santiycr: - curl the same jar from s3 again 
[17:31:29] santiycr: headers and time to load in both would clearly say the jar wasn't being cached by squid 
[17:31:39] santiycr: been wondering if the problem is that I"m pulling them from S3
[17:32:08] santiycr: and maybe S3 is not setting the magic caching incantation via http headers
[17:32:30] santiycr: but I also have been trying to just make squid ignore that, JIK and I didn't get it to do it anyways
[17:32:54] santiycr: I've prioritized #3498 first, but the jar cache is next in the list

[22:20:55] dude-x: hmm action chain mouseover doesn't work for me anymore on this page :/
[22:21:11] freynaud: but those need to be implemented server side too
[22:21:20] freynaud: so that's not something a user would create
[22:21:54] jimevans: freynaud: i disagree. they don't *have* to be implemented server side.
[22:22:01] barancev: they can be implemented on the client side via executeJavascript
[22:22:11] jimevans: it's probably more efficient if they are, but they don't *have* to be.
[22:22:30] freynaud: in that case, you can do most of that with a CrazyXpathLocator :)
[22:23:22] barancev: do you suggest to deprecate all locators except for xpath? :)
[22:23:26] jimevans: true, but using sizzle would traditionally almost always be faster than xpath in IE.
[22:23:48] jimevans: though to be fair, i haven't done any perf testing with the new xpath engine.
[22:24:49] freynaud: barancev: i'm always very suspicious when I see new feature like that
[22:24:58] AutomatedTester: barancev: do you want the things that css doesnt handle with sizzle?
[22:24:59] barancev: santiycr: https://saucelabs.com/jobs/a95152f43ad347b297ee250826b2c395 -- no video anymore, but we're still out of memory
[22:25:02] AutomatedTester: e.g. :contains
[22:25:07] freynaud: selenium should support my framework, because it's better than any standard out there
[22:25:37] barancev: AutomatedTester: me? no, thanks, I prefer pure css
[22:25:38] AutomatedTester: freynaud: because it has Crazy at the front?
[22:25:50] freynaud: AutomatedTester: that too :)
[22:26:27] *AutomatedTester wishes the internet would download quicker
[22:26:33] jimevans: freynaud: but that's the point, all i'm doing is allowing the user to support the framework they want to, without selenium having to support it.
[22:26:47] freynaud: kk
[22:27:11] barancev: we can either claim that locator set is fixed and can't be expended, or tell what's recommended way to extend it
[22:27:17] jimevans: it easily short-circuits that argument. "oh, you want it to support your framework? you can do that yourself, and here's howâ€¦"
[22:29:11] AutomatedTester: <3 not being able to replicate issues
[22:30:50] AJ__ has joined #selenium
[22:31:56] barancev: do we want this or not, users will attempt to extent webdriver, because its API is too low-level
[22:32:17] barancev: good API is a big win, look at watir
[22:32:31] barancev: and we have to provide some guidance
[22:32:43] *jimevans wishes the support classes were in a separate project.
[22:33:57] jimevans: but i fully understand why they aren't. :)
[22:34:01] barancev: otherwise extensions will be like SikuliWebDriver (http://code.google.com/p/sikuli-api/wiki/SikuliWebDriver), not WedDriver'ish
[22:35:14] barancev: how to create a custom locator, how to create a custom search conext, how to create a wrapper
[22:35:42] jimevans: i could easily see someone doing a "By.image" extension.
[22:36:03] freynaud: jimevans: would you do it client or server side ?
[22:36:35] barancev: freynaud: what do you have against local test runs? :)
[22:36:37] jimevans: freynaud: if i needed it for myself? client-side probably. then if there was enough demand
[22:36:51] jimevans: maybe see about implementing it server-side.
[22:37:24] jimevans: however, server-side has its own issues to be overcome, like wire protocol extensions/modifications, and so on.
[22:38:06] freynaud: jimevans: I thought about it before, and I'm not sure I see the adv. of serverside
[22:38:12] noahsussman has joined #selenium
[22:38:35] freynaud: you'll have to transfer images anyway. The reference you compare against, or the page screenshot
[22:39:20] jimevans: fair enough. it's hypothetical to me anyway. :)
[22:41:07] AutomatedTester: freynaud: clientside will cause a lot of traffic between browser and client code
[22:41:10] barancev: I can think about other locators, specific to each widget library
[22:41:29] AutomatedTester: if its done serverside you keep the client code simpler
[22:41:42] AutomatedTester: and you can push a lot to server and wait for a reply
[22:41:46] AutomatedTester: e.g. implicit waits
[22:43:08] barancev: it's all about API, and it's important
[22:43:27] barancev: to allow people create usable API around webdriver
[22:43:47] AutomatedTester: +1 for doing that
[22:43:57] AutomatedTester: webdriver should be a base for people to build on top of
[22:44:49] santiycr: barancev: I am investigating on the implications of bumping up the RAM in our linux VMs
[22:45:12] santiycr: right now they have 768MB
[22:45:25] santiycr: kind of sad a 10' firefox test is eating up all of it
[22:46:27] *AutomatedTester cant wait for m-day and remove the leaky extension code we have
[22:46:27] selbot2: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[22:50:25] barancev has joined #selenium
[22:51:20] AutomatedTester: barancev: what are you still doing up?
[22:51:26] *AutomatedTester just realised the time
[22:52:02] barancev: creating a scenario in JMeter for a client :)
[22:52:52] AutomatedTester: barancev: local client or foreign client?
[22:52:58] AutomatedTester: e.g. west coast US
[22:53:37] barancev: local, but I need to debug the scenario on a semi-production server, so doing this at night
[22:53:44] AutomatedTester: ahh
[22:54:32] *jimevans <3 selbot2
[22:55:14] jimevans: the :contains() pseudoselector: the webdriver meme that wouldn't die. 
[22:56:04] santiycr: barancev:  I just bumped linux vms to 1GB of RAM
[22:56:20] *santiycr really hopes tests don't need more than that
[22:58:30] runnyspot: santiycr: is there a ticketing system at sauce for feature requests?
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Dec 10 23:00:36 2012]
[23:00:36] barancev: santiycr: when this change shold go to production?
[23:01:25] AutomatedTester: lolwut, there is a new Se Community in the UK
[23:01:54] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i'm not planning on making any more real changes for my marionette driver implementation for awhile. i've gotten the base implementation done, so until m-day, i think i've solved the large bits of the problem i wanted to solve.
[23:01:54] selbot2: M-Day: day in the future when Marionette is made available for non-debug builds
[23:03:25] santiycr: barancev:  after 7pm today

[23:52:48] AutomatedTester: detronizator: wassup dude
[23:53:12] detronizator: question (probably dummy) about the Selenium JARs
[23:53:37] detronizator: I know u are not "the java go-to guy" but surely you are aware
[23:53:51] detronizator: I might have missed something of the crazyfunbuild system
[23:54:09] detronizator: I don't have my phantomjs-driver jar in the selenium 2.27.0 release
[23:54:22] AutomatedTester: oh
[23:54:22] detronizator: at least from what I see in my IDE
[23:54:24] AutomatedTester: um...
[23:54:38] AutomatedTester: when you look inside the jar?

[23:56:34] detronizator: so there is some other configuration bit in some build.desc that I totally missed
[23:56:37] detronizator: :(
[23:56:43] AutomatedTester: did you update the build.desc file to pull the dependency?
[23:56:54] detronizator: which one? :)
[23:57:10] AutomatedTester: um let me fire up intellij
[23:57:21] detronizator: I did provide one for my directory in /java/third_party/phantomjs-driver/build.desc
[23:57:32] detronizator: but it's clear that I missed somethign else
