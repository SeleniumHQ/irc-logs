[15:25:20] jarib: what's up?
[15:25:20] llaskin1: https://gist.github.com/4268648  if anyone has any thoughts on why this won't click at line 5, and actually seems to fail at line 4 for some reason, i would much appreciate....
[15:25:31] llaskin1: its a ruby question, but perhaps a selenium question
[15:25:44] solofight: AutomatedTester: you happen to have opened chrome with its profile using python earlier ?
[15:25:59] AutomatedTester: solofight: no, as I said I didnt test my code
[15:27:26] jarib: llaskin1: i don't really understand the code
[15:27:40] llaskin1: basically if the expected "type" is in the dropdown, click on that value in the dropdown
[15:28:09] jarib: i don't get the last two lines, for one
[15:28:16] llaskin1: given that ddown_values comes out to be the array (fuck I made it a hash, it shoudl be an array)
[15:28:35] jarib: in 1.9 it's invalid syntax
[15:29:09] jarib: why are you reusing the ddown_values variable after the loop? it was an array of elements, and you overwrite it to be an array of strings
[15:29:13] solofight: AutomatedTester: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver here in the known issues they say cannot specify custom profile ! ! 
[15:29:19] jarib: it's hard to see why
[15:29:27] llaskin1: https://gist.github.com/4268694  better
[15:29:28] solofight: does that mean i cannot use the existing profile for the selenium test case ?
[15:29:41] llaskin1: sorry this is actually the correct syntax, and correct version
[15:30:01] jarib: llaskin1: String#click doesn't exist
[15:30:11] jarib: String#text doesn't exist
[15:30:14] llaskin1: ugh
[15:30:26] jarib: please use actual code for the examples :)

[15:31:02] llaskin1: my example writing just sucks
[15:31:05] llaskin1: read the new version
[15:31:46] llaskin1: basically the values of the Element#text call are "visit", "foo", "bar"
[15:33:38] llaskin1: and this works on a windows environment but not in a linux one, which is even more frustrating

[15:35:12] llaskin1: i think its click() not having effect
[15:35:21] llaskin1: because I just checked my code with a lot of output and such...and it says it clicked on the value
[15:35:25] llaskin1: any thoughts why it woudln't click?

[15:35:52] llaskin1: works fine on Win7..but not 12.04
[15:36:16] jarib: ok, so it's definitely a selenium question and not a ruby question then, right?
[15:36:24] llaskin1: yea i guess so.
[15:37:05] jarib: there's nothing in that code that lets us figure out why click has no effect

[15:42:30] jarib: the selenium build is using JRuby 1.6 something, if that's what you mean
[15:42:40] Ajay__: yep
[15:43:00] jarib: check third_party/jruby/VERSION
[15:43:18] jarib: updating to 1.7 would be good
[15:43:21] jarib: lots of improvements
[15:43:37] jarib: though i'm hearing rumors that the build is being rewritten in java
[15:44:13] Ajay__: i was thinking of updating the jars 
[15:44:43] llaskin1: jarib, working on it as best I can...
[15:44:49] dawagner: Probably not worth updating jruby if it's just for crazyfun
[15:44:50] Ajay__: jruby 1.6.0.dev (ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 330)
[15:45:08] dawagner: A first-cut java version should be landing actually-quite-soon
[15:45:15] jarib: Ajay__: it's not as simple as just updating the jar, we have a custom build with dependencies included
[15:45:28] Ajay__: yeah ... 
[15:45:46] jarib: so given what dawagner says, probably not worth pursuing
[15:46:01] Ajay__: jarib::-) dawagner: :)

[15:47:05] Ajay__: dawagner: how can i reduce the build times ? 
[15:47:40] AutomatedTester: Ajay__: wait for the new version ?
[15:47:46] jarib: while i'm here… is there some sexy equivalent of ruby's Array#map in Guava?
[15:47:53] *jarib is writing java today
[15:47:53] dawagner: You can try it out, it does most things but not quite all of them
[15:47:59] dawagner: jarib: What does Array#map do?
[15:48:07] *AutomatedTester hugs jarib for having to write Java
[15:48:28] jarib: dawagner:  [1,2,3].map { |e| e * 2 } #=> [2,4,6]
[15:48:39] jarib: AutomatedTester: appreciated
[15:48:51] dawagner: Ajay__: Grab https://code.google.com/p/crazy-fun/source/browse/crazy.jar?name=new_world
[15:49:11] jarib: basically i want to wrap each object in a List
[15:49:17] jarib: and return a new List
[15:49:48] jarib: i.e. [1,2,3].map { |e| Foo.new(e) } #=> [#<Foo n=1>, #<Foo n=2>, #<Foo n=3>]
[15:49:48] AutomatedTester: jarib: what you need is a Lambda...
[15:49:49] dawagner: Maps.asMap(Set<K>, Function<K, V>) exists, I think
[15:50:18] jarib: dawagner: i don't want a Map though, think map as in map/reduce
[15:50:26] *AutomatedTester stops trolling
[15:50:31] dawagner: Oh!
[15:50:34] dawagner: You want a transform!
[15:50:39] jarib: aha!
[15:50:41] dawagner: Iterables.transform(Iterable, Function)

[15:51:55] jarib: dawagner: do i need to write the Function from scratch, or is there something where i can just pass in the class?
[15:51:57] *jarib is lazy
[15:52:11] dawagner: What function do you want?
[15:52:37] jarib: basically { new Foo(entry) }
[15:52:49] caddoo has joined #selenium
[15:53:07] dawagner: That you probably get to write from scratch
[15:53:09] jarib: ok
[15:53:21] dawagner: Java 8 should actually have function syntactic sugar
[15:53:42] *jarib wants something like Iterables.transform(myList, Transforms.wrapIn(Foo.class))
[15:54:38] dawagner: Yeah, java doesn't so much do that
[15:54:47] jarib: i hoped guava would :)
[15:54:55] dawagner: It can't change the language enough to
[15:54:57] dawagner: Scala? ;)
[15:55:36] jarib: not an option in this case
[15:56:11] dawagner: I can't remember what 8's syntax is meant to actually look like, but it would be something like map(myList, { x -> new Foo(x) }
[15:56:20] davehunt: seleniumhq lists Selenium 2.25... aren't we on 2.28 now?
[15:56:33] davehunt: issues with building/deploying the site again?
[15:56:39] AutomatedTester: davehunt: kida
[15:56:40] AutomatedTester: kinda
[15:56:50] AutomatedTester: we need to move DNS, which sounds near impossible
[15:56:52] dawagner: Does anyone know what the DNS holdup is?
[15:56:55] jarib: dawagner:  looks like the result of Iterables.transform needs a cast anyway, not sure this will end up being more readable than the plain old for loop
[15:57:12] dawagner: Because I have the ability to change DNS entries, but I was told someone else was doing so...
[15:57:15] AutomatedTester: dawagner: lukeis, plightbo and simonstewart know
[15:57:26] davehunt: this is interesting... Selenium IDE is totally broken in Firefox 20
[15:57:39] dawagner: jarib: Yeah? Or you could fix the thing you're passing to to accept an Iterable rather than a List or whatever it takes :)
[15:58:08] AutomatedTester: davehunt: ask LukeIS when he gets here, he normally joins around 4pm out time
[15:58:24] AutomatedTester: our even

[20:00:56] RossPatterson: Dijkstra famously said "the teaching of BASIC should be rated as a criminal offence: it mutilates the mind beyond recovery".  I'm not sure I agree, but I'd certainly say that the C memory non-model belongs in higher-level classes, with assembly code.
[20:01:04] jleyba: That was an interesting - and ancient - language
[20:02:05] RossPatterson: Mmm ... FORTH.  I wrote a FORTH engine one summer for fun.  It's interesting in the same way LISP is - once you get a handful of functions written, it's self-hosting, you just load in the standard library.

[21:18:09] jimevans: barancev: their library is broken. console.<anything> in IE only evaluates to an object when the F12 debugging tools are open.
[21:18:22] jimevans: (which is IE being stupid, but that's the way it works)

[21:19:28] jimevans: i've been working on the issue for awhile now. i have no idea what may be causing it.
[21:20:16] jimevans: if you set a breakpoint in your webdriver code after the call to click(), and manually try to click on the element in IE, it won't accept the click.

[21:36:33] jimevans: barancev: i'm an idiot. the reason it won't accept the click manually is because of persistent hover. turning that off doesn't fix the problem, mind, but it does allow a manual click when you set your breakpoint.

[21:38:59] jarib: lukeis: if i were to do ui tests for ios/android, what should i look at?
[21:39:32] *jarib hasn't followed along in that space lately
[21:39:48] lukeis: jarib: with the 'webdriver' api? or what they each offer?
[21:40:01] jarib: either, best tool for the job?
[21:41:00] lukeis: hmm, so UIAutomation (iOS product) is 'best' tool, things like appium and ios-driver (github projects) use the webdriver api, but are slow due to communication constraints with apple instruments
[21:42:26] lukeis: android, native_driver has some decent capabilities, with android16+ you can now use UIAutomator (note 'tor' not 'tion' ~ that's iOS)
[21:42:27] jcarr: jarib: if you can stand to modify your application code to include a server to accept commands, there are a lot of options. If you don't want to do that, it's UIAutomation.
[21:43:32] jarib: lukeis: i thought native_driver was dead? or is that not the same project?
[21:43:41] lukeis: it is 'dead'
[21:43:44] lukeis: but it works...
[21:43:47] jarib: ok
[21:43:55] jarib: jcarr: what's the list of options?
[21:43:56] lukeis: and i have an internal fork
[21:44:19] jarib: lukeis: why aren't you using UIAtomator?
[21:44:34] lukeis: support for < Android16
[21:44:36] jarib: *k
[21:45:07] jcarr: jarib: frank, calabash for putting a server in the app. frank is good if you're a rubyist. appium, ios_driver wrap UIAutomation with a webdriver api.
[21:46:17] jarib: are appium/ios_driver compliant enough to be used on on grid nodes?
[21:46:35] lukeis: ios-driver for sure
[21:46:44] lukeis: françois is writing that one ;)
[21:46:50] lukeis: and they only use grid
[21:46:51] jarib: aha
[21:46:53] simonstewart: lukeis: < Android 16 is going to die sooner rather than later
[21:46:57] simonstewart: Don't let it hold you back
[21:47:07] jarib: lukeis:  what's the appeal of appium over ios_driver then?
[21:47:15] lukeis: simonstewart: i'm not for future… but they are still demanding support for it
[21:47:16] jarib: *ios-driver
[21:47:21] cgoldberg: anyone going to GTAC 2013?   .. just saw the announcement
[21:47:29] lukeis: jarib: python vs java ;)
[21:47:31] simonstewart: I'm thinking of putting a paper together.
[21:47:35] simonstewart: It'd be fun :)
[21:47:46] *adamgoucher thinks gtac has left the shark that was jumped well in its wake...
[21:47:47] jarib: lukeis: who cares if it's the wire protocol
[21:48:08] lukeis: yep..
[21:48:12] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, i want to go because it's in NYC and easy to get to
[21:48:15] jarib: ok, thanks guys
[21:48:18] jcarr: np
[21:48:36] lukeis: jarib: honestly ios-driver has more implemented, but modifies the api a bit to handle it's own locators and elements
[21:48:41] jarib: cgoldberg: i like the subject
[21:48:53] cgoldberg: yea... mobile
[21:49:00] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[21:49:11] jcarr: I'm definitely interested in the topic too, but good luck getting a ticket.
[21:49:19] cgoldberg: i submitted the form to attend GTAC... i hope they accept creeps like me :)
[21:49:21] jarib: lukeis: so appium aims at greater compatibility?
[21:49:38] jarib: cgoldberg: what form? i only see "stay tuned"
[21:49:46] lukeis: jarib: yes… but currently only supports one locator strategy by tag name
[21:49:55] adamgoucher: 'Presentations are targeted at student, academic, and experienced engineers working on test automation.' to me means it will be too general to be useful. but i'm an elitist bastard. :D
[21:50:15] jarib: adamgoucher: did you ever go to GTAC?
[21:50:27] cgoldberg: jarib, weird! they took the form down.. i filled it out this morning
[21:50:37] jarib: interesting
[21:50:54] lukeis: already at capacity? :-/
[21:51:05] *lukeis wanted to try to submit to go
[21:51:11] cgoldberg: jarib, this linked to it earlier... now it says nothing: http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2012/10/gtac-coming-to-new-york-in-spring.html
[21:51:22] adamgoucher: jarib nope. dont have to since all the things are recorded and broadcast. the first 2 were interesting and i regret not being there. now, its just another broad conference
[21:52:50] adamgoucher: 'mobile' is even too damn broad to be useful a topic. 'native android', 'native ios' or 'html5 on mobile' would be far more useful. heck, if gtac was 3 days with a single focus per day then it would be interesting.
[21:52:53] cgoldberg: jarib, sorry.  i'm losing my mind :)  it *is* still posted:  http://googletesting.blogspot.it/2012/12/gtac-call-for-proposals-attendance.html
[21:53:22] adamgoucher: (and if they discluded acedemia in their audience; acedemia is useless in this space … and most spaces actually)
[21:53:32] *adamgoucher is apparently cranky and should likely eat something
[21:53:39] *cgoldberg no idea why i just have a google italy link
[21:54:11] lukeis: simonstewart: would it shock you to know that the highest percentage of our android users are on 2.3 (gingerbread)
[21:54:25] simonstewart: Actually, that's a great step forward
[21:54:30] jarib: adamgoucher: i could've just watched the videos from Zurich in 2009, but then i wouldn't have met simonstewart, dawagner, eranm and AutomatedTester and probably wouldn't have written the ruby bindings
[21:54:34] simonstewart: Froyo was massive for a long time
[21:54:38] jcarr: lukeis: that's the highest percentage of android users, so that's good
[21:54:41] AutomatedTester: fwiw, I <3 watching Marionette dance
[21:54:50] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, are presentations from academia/theoretical?  or is it more like velocity or something practical?
[21:54:50] simonstewart: I personally think that JellyBean will be the new Froyo
[21:54:51] jarib: adamgoucher: if you think you can just watch the videos, you need to attend better conferences :)
[21:55:00] simonstewart: That is, the version of android that everyone is stuck at
[21:55:08] simonstewart: And wouldn't actually be that bad
[21:56:27] adamgoucher: cgoldberg: i'm painting acedemia with a very large brush aquired from dealing with them in the testing world. 'works in my lab' where lab is not even a distant approximation of the real world
[21:56:38] cgoldberg: adamgoucher, oh i hear ya
[21:56:41] lukeis: well… for now (probably next 1 yr+) we'll need to test on 'older' versions, but I have plans (writing a plan now for work) on how to use both native driver and uiautomator
[21:56:46] barancev: my historical view of browser support: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AumDe6oexQkwdEZHaVMwbjhkTkZoaXZDMjg4UXRZTUE
[21:57:09] simonstewart: The nice thing is that mobile devices tend to be tied to 18 - 24 month contracts
[21:57:21] simonstewart: So they expire nice and fast
[21:57:27] lukeis: barancev: missing 3.0 and 3.5 ;)
[21:57:33] adamgoucher: jarib: if the best part of a conference is the hallway track, then the conference is banking on its past success / reputation

[23:52:39] detronizator: yes
[23:52:40] detronizator: Amazon
[23:52:41] detronizator: :)
[23:52:57] jimevans: (and don't call me shirley)
[23:53:12] detronizator: shirley?
[23:53:13] *lukeis noticed jimevans called himself that
[23:53:19] jleyba: stupid perforce… auto-merge my damn files!
[23:53:28] jimevans: well, i didn't know if detronizator would pick up the reference.
[23:53:31] *detronizator is missing some key info here
[23:53:34] lukeis: hahaha… peforce...
[23:53:52] AutomatedTester: lol 500 on a phantomjs UA
[23:53:55] lukeis: detronizator: it's an OLD joke ;)
[23:53:58] AutomatedTester: thats not ideal
[23:54:05] AutomatedTester: if anything it should be a 405
[23:54:20] detronizator: I think I'll implement it 
[23:54:24] jimevans: :yt don't call me shirley
[23:54:25] selbot2: Don't call me Shirley - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A5t5_O8hdA&feature=youtube_gdata
[23:54:28] detronizator: so whatever UA you provide
[23:54:36] detronizator: I'll append something like
[23:54:50] detronizator: "-FU, I'm PhantomJS!!!"
[23:54:51] AutomatedTester: detronizator: what sites have started this?
[23:55:10] jleyba: a long time ago when Google Docs was first launched they blacked listed Opera
[23:55:20] jleyba: using a user-agent check
[23:55:33] AutomatedTester: everything Google does is via UA checks
[23:55:38] detronizator: AutomatedTester: so far, I have seen Amazon and this other site http://www.namejet.com/
[23:56:06] AutomatedTester: detronizator: I heard the guy working on GhostDriver works at Amazon, maybe he can fix that?
[23:56:56] lukeis: www.amazon.com just worked for me, is it another sub site or login page or something?
[23:57:13] jleyba: detronizator: phantomJS uses qt-webkit, right?
[23:57:19] detronizator: jleyba: yes
[23:57:38] *lukeis running a phantomjs built 11/26 though...
[23:57:59] detronizator: lukeis: weird... I have seen myself the code that blacklists phantomjs on amazon.com
[23:58:21] jleyba: Does amazon check for phantomjs specifically?
[23:58:21] lukeis: maybe it's not on the homepage?
[23:59:04] jimevans: while we're on the subject, and just as a heads-up, in case anyone tries to run the java webdriver tests using phantomjs, there are a couple of phantomjs bugs that affect the webdriver test suite.
