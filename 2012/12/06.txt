[09:10:17] ChristopheD: Hi all! Just wondering if the following code (http://pastebin.com/tCXq7iuL) is still uptodate for selenium2? Is it the good way to get a driver from a browser string?
[09:14:13] Manoj_: christopheD: For selenium 2 Why you would need to start the selenium server ?
[09:15:51] Manoj_: Selenium 2 doesnt require any start of server like the Selenium RC. If you use RC, you use this component to start the server through your Java code. I stil use it and it works fine for Selenium RC.

[09:20:52] rananda has joined #selenium
[09:23:31] ChristopheD: to explain. I would like to instantiate the web driver from a browserString to be able to configure it.
[09:24:00] zac_sel has joined #selenium
[09:24:07] ChristopheD: In this way? I will be able to choose the browser for my test suite
[09:24:19] rbalent has joined #selenium
[09:24:21] ChristopheD: but I don't know how to do that
[09:25:20] ChristopheD: at this time, I use driver = new FirefoxDriver(); and I would like to broke the hard dependency to the browser in the code
[09:26:00] zac_sel: ChristopheD, have you tried RemoteWebDriver
[09:26:33] ChristopheD: not yet, do you think I need to use a local hub to do that?
[09:27:32] jds__ has joined #selenium
[09:34:53] Manoj_: you can have it as a string defined some where in the testdata sheet as browser=firefox or browser=chrome and in your code you can instantiate some thing like,
[09:34:53] teodosia_sel has joined #selenium
[09:35:47] Manoj_: if browser.equalsignorecase(firefox) then instantiate firefoxdriver or if its equals chrome instantiate google chrome. - Simple way this is, not sure if this is what you have asked for.
[09:37:12] Manoj_: you have it in elseif statements to check for multiple browsers and instantiate according to the string that you pass.
[09:38:02] ChristopheD: yes, it is possible to do that. I was thinking this functionality already exists in selenium2 but perhaps not. thanks
[09:38:18] ddary has joined #selenium
[09:39:35] Manoj_: ChristopheD: glad you got it.
[09:41:17] Manoj_: ChristopheD: you may wanna have a look at this as well. http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities
[09:41:57] aivaturi has joined #selenium
[09:47:49] ChristopheD: @Manoj_ : DesiredCapabilities need to be used with RemoteWebDriver. From WebDriver API : "Currently, you will need to instantiate implementations of this class directly." So, I will need to write a method to instantiate a browser from a browserString if I want to saty with a local WebDriver.

[13:54:33] AutomatedTester: ok, Manoj you have 1 question
[13:55:01] santiycr: oh hai
[13:55:06] santiycr: yeah, I'm here
[13:55:22] Manoj: I remember we were discussing about the Marionette few days back, and it was that Marionette is used by In-house Mozilla and it contains the WebDriver API .. and it will be replaced for FirefoxDriver
[13:55:24] jimevans: AutomatedTester: fair enough. i can see how mozprocess is doing it. seems ratherâ€¦ violent (terminate process is "dirty")
[13:55:32] cmcgraw has joined #selenium
[13:55:44] Manoj: also you stated that marionette is used to test the browser components and add-ons.
[13:56:08] AutomatedTester: jimevans: mozprocess is being rejigged at the moment
[13:56:15] AutomatedTester: a lot of people arent happy with it
[13:56:21] jimevans: i can see why
[13:56:33] AutomatedTester: Manoj: was that your question?
[13:56:35] Manoj: So the question is - Marionette can overcome the constraint of interacting with the browser ? like accessing File, 
[13:56:49] farlan has joined #selenium
[13:57:05] AutomatedTester: Manoj: the same way that webdriver does
[13:57:30] Manoj: AutomatedTester: sorry, just provied some details so that ay one can understand.
[13:57:51] AutomatedTester: santiycr: I sent an email to the mailing list about Firefox support, can someone from Sauce have a look and join the discussion
[13:58:04] Manoj: AutomatedTester: Why not provide the power of same, as you guys use in-house of testing the browser componets add-ons.
[13:58:24] AutomatedTester: Manoj: huh?
[13:58:48] Manoj: yeah. Would be a nice. 
[13:59:01] AutomatedTester: WebDriver can interact with input=file, I dont understand your question
[13:59:07] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[13:59:27] Manoj: some ppl claim that. THough selenium is a browser automation framework, it itself cant interact with the menu items.
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Dec  6 14:00:02 2012]
[14:00:02] AutomatedTester: right, so when you said file you mean browser chrome menu items?
[14:00:22] Manoj: yes, those File, Edit,
[14:00:31] Manoj: accessing File -> new tab
[14:00:41] Manoj: interatcing with those menus...
[14:00:56] AutomatedTester: Manoj: marionette can interact with that
[14:01:11] AutomatedTester: but from a web testers point of view, they dont need to interact with those
[14:01:48] Manoj: hmm ok. Just thought as you said Marionette already used by In-house automation team to test the browser components and the add-ons as well.
[14:02:07] AutomatedTester: we use mozmill atm 
[14:02:14] AutomatedTester: for testing Firefox
[14:02:17] Manoj: It would be nice if we have that as well. 
[14:02:18] AutomatedTester: Marionette will replace that
[14:02:31] AutomatedTester: Manoj: why?
[14:02:41] AutomatedTester: why do you need to test the browser chrome

[14:06:02] Manoj: Accessing the File menu opening the new tab and going to the Toole menu and clicking on Add-ons and checkign whether the add-ons installed are present.. something like that.

[14:13:38] jimevans: Manoj: i would argue then that selenium isn't the right tool for that.

[14:14:51] danqa has joined #selenium
[14:14:55] AutomatedTester: just because they only know Selenium
[14:15:30] Manoj: AutomatedTester: yup i agree that selenium doesn't do that. Just asked as you said Marionette will be replaced and thought this Marionette will come with this power of accessing Menu's. I assumed that because you said that Marionette used by In-house  to test the browser itself and Add-ons.
[14:15:46] AutomatedTester: it *will* replace
[14:15:59] *AutomatedTester can't seem to emphasize the *will* enough
[14:16:22] AutomatedTester: Marionette WILL replace mozmill eventually
[14:17:11] Manoj: yeah again this statement - "Marionette WILL replace mozmill eventually" - makes me think that Marionette will be used in accessing the menus.
[14:17:34] Manoj: just my assumption, may be wrong. Thought of clarifying it :)
[14:17:44] davehunt has joined #selenium
[14:17:50] jimevans: Manoj: marionette will be able to; firefoxdriver won't. (AutomatedTester, correct me if i'm wrong)
[14:17:51] AutomatedTester: it WILL be used to access menus
[14:18:14] AutomatedTester: I give up, I dont know how to explain this any better
[14:18:14] Manoj: jimevans: you are right.
[14:18:44] Mkop has joined #selenium
[14:18:47] jimevans: AutomatedTester: part of the disconnect is that we're not emphasizing the "subset" aspect of the marionette/webdriver relationship.
[14:18:59] jimevans: i think
[14:19:09] Ardesco: I guess he;s asking if the WebDriver API will be extended to enable you to test the browser chrome when marionette comes in AutomatedTester 
[14:19:16] Ardesco: which I assume the answer is no
[14:19:17] Ardesco: :)
[14:19:24] Manoj: AutomatedTester: Alright, I understood a bit :)
[14:19:34] AutomatedTester: you can use the webdriver API to automate the browser chrome of Firefox
[14:19:38] AutomatedTester: with marionette
[14:19:48] AutomatedTester: 1 API
[14:19:56] Manoj: Ardesco: yup you are right.
[14:19:59] AutomatedTester: 2 contexts. chrome and content
[14:20:24] *AutomatedTester needs to write a blog post about this then
[14:20:51] Manoj: AutomatedTester: That is what exactly i was going to suggest :)
[14:21:19] Manoj: I thought og writing a post on it . Glad i had a conversation otherwise I would be wrong.
[14:21:36] *AutomatedTester thinks, to be honest, that most people are going to be confused by it
[14:21:41] Ardesco: I guess I worded that badly as well, I meant to say will the browser chrome of firefox be accessible through WebDriver 2.xx.xx when marionette replaces FireFox driver
[14:21:53] Ardesco: which I assume is a no
[14:21:55] jimevans: interesting. i don't think of the "webdriver API" (by which i mean the language bindings API) as concerning itself with the "chrome" context.
[14:22:00] Ardesco: although it's quite possible i'm wrong
[14:22:07] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: no
[14:22:14] AutomatedTester: it wont be available
[14:22:33] AutomatedTester: because the Selenium API doesn't have the notion of contexts
[14:22:37] AutomatedTester: it only deals with content
[14:22:48] jimevans: right. then my understanding isn't so far off.
[14:22:55] Ardesco: I think that is the answer Manoj was looking for
[14:23:29] AutomatedTester: but FirefoxDriver is just a subset of Marionette
[14:23:31] mfrost503 has joined #selenium
[14:23:34] AutomatedTester: the content part
[14:23:48] Ardesco: It doesn't make sense for WebDriver to suddenly be able to interact with the chrome for one browser
[14:24:05] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: totally agree
[14:24:14] AutomatedTester: but if people want to, then they cant
[14:24:16] Ardesco: but I guess I can see why people think it may start to be able to when Marionette support comes in
[14:24:18] AutomatedTester: cant even
[14:24:35] AutomatedTester: Ardesco: the funtionality will be in the browser
[14:24:40] AutomatedTester: we just wont be exposing it
[14:24:56] AutomatedTester: well, I hope we wont be exposing it
[14:24:57] Ardesco: which again comes back to the right tool for the right job thing :)
[14:25:50] cgoldberg has joined #selenium
[14:28:35] *Ardesco keeps forgetting that the WebDriver API is going to becomes a W3C spec so referring to the API probably has slightly different connotations now
[14:29:00] Ardesco: oh jimevans you left before I could agree that I think it's most likely a wgxpath issue yesterday
[14:29:28] Ardesco: :)
[14:29:35] Manoj: <AutomatedTester> well, I hope we wont be exposing it
[14:29:47] Manoj: understood.
[14:29:57] AutomatedTester: Manoj: if you want to test addons
[14:30:07] jimevans: Ardesco; could be, but i thought the same thing about not being able to find using @class='foo'.
[14:30:10] AutomatedTester: then you would, in the future, use marionette instead of selenium
[14:30:53] Manoj: Ardesco: AutomatedTester:jimevans: Thanks finally got the answer. I was confused that it would support. But as Ardesco said suddenly one browser wont support that.
[14:31:03] Ardesco: i'll try dig into it at some point and see if I can offer anything more useful
[14:31:47] Ardesco: but I only have remote access too windows VM's atm and frankly I'd rather scoop my eyes out with a rusty spoon than spend more time trying to debug tests remotely...
[14:32:21] Manoj: Ardesco: I think AutomatedTester will blog on this. As he got this question exactly and many ppl might think or assume the same as my question.
[14:33:26] Ardesco: I suggest a title of "Y U NO UNDERSTAND MARIONETTE "  with a fuuuuuu face
[14:33:27] Ardesco: :)
[14:33:40] *Ardesco has obviously read jimevans blog too much

[15:16:21] barancev: iirc, the main reason for it was safari support
[15:16:49] adamgoucher: well, the main reason was to act as a bridge between rc and webdriver
[15:17:04] barancev: for what purpose?
[15:17:24] barancev: nobody migrates from webdriver to rc
[15:17:37] adamgoucher: oh. read that wrong.

[16:09:06] Ardesco: maybe not willingly
[16:09:10] Ardesco: ;)
[16:09:17] Manoj: Ardesco: There was a direct communication between me and him and he said he is no more taking care of it.
[16:09:30] Manoj: Ardesco: may be ..
[16:09:36] Ardesco: as i said, not willingly :P
[16:09:41] Manoj: SO after him, no one yet ?
[16:09:50] Ardesco: not aware of anyone
[16:09:57] Ardesco: got a problem with safari driver?

[16:10:36] Ardesco: regional slang can really muddy the water
[16:10:40] Manoj: bad.. ...
[16:10:45] Ardesco: what's it doing ?
[16:11:00] Manoj: yup really felt it yesterday.
[16:11:20] Ardesco: it's generally ok for me
[16:11:43] Manoj: many issues, that the script running fine in chrome, firefox doesnt work well safari.
[16:11:56] samphippen has joined #selenium
[16:12:11] Manoj: yeah for me too its feel ok. But can be improved upto the quality of Firefox and chrome
[16:12:19] Ardesco: all our tests are running across chrome/firefox/safari/ie9 and all are working
[16:12:31] Ardesco: the only changes I had to make for safari were around mouse hovers
[16:12:38] Ardesco: IE required much more work
[16:12:44] Ardesco: IE8 is going to require even more
[16:12:51] adamgoucher: android is in just as much disrepair as safari
[16:12:56] Ardesco: have you got a specific issue?
[16:12:59] Manoj: SafariDriver doesnt handle alerts, and actions class properly.
[16:13:08] Ardesco: Actions class just isn't implemented
[16:13:17] Ardesco: there are ways around it though
[16:13:18] Manoj: yeah....
[16:13:32] jimevans: patches welcome?
[16:13:33] Manoj: managing with the Js
[16:13:47] Ardesco: what i've done atm is pure hackery jimevans 
[16:14:17] Ardesco: I've started trying to write an actions class to pass back but that's stalled for the momemnt
[16:14:20] jimevans: Ardesco: i meant for safari, but i'll take it for IE. :)
[16:14:23] Manoj: jimevans: I am not a developer so could not contribute on that front. However preparing something on the documentation front.
[16:14:32] Ardesco: completing on new house tomorrow and the next couple of weeks will be moving and painting and stuff
[16:14:45] Ardesco: I mean for safari :)
[16:14:49] jimevans: Manoj: do you write webdriver code for automating websites?

[16:15:46] alexglow has joined #selenium
[16:15:49] Manoj: SafariDriver just dismiss the alerts.. and that;s the way that is written. FOr me a scenario is like on clicking on OK button on the alert will give me one more alert and then clicking on OK on the 2nd alert will navigate to the other page.

[16:16:22] Manoj: jimevans: Yes, offcourse 3+ years with selenium now, :)
[16:16:41] jimevans: Manoj: then guess what? you're a developer. 
[16:16:54] *Ardesco high fives jimevans 
[16:17:07] Manoj: :)
[16:17:21] jimevans: seriously, writing code is writing code.
[16:17:33] jimevans: doesn't matter if you're using webdriver or another library.
[16:17:57] Manoj: yup, I agree. Not sure how this experience in writing code with the API availalle will, help to code for the API's.
[16:18:03] Ardesco: hmm wasn't there some alert code going into 2.27.0
[16:18:04] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[16:18:05] *Ardesco looks
[16:18:26] jimevans: now, you may not be terribly familiar with the architecture of the code you'd need to step into to submit a patch for webdriver, or the language it's written in, but that's only a matter of degree.
[16:19:18] Ardesco: no not there yet
[16:19:19] Manoj: yup, but I am aware of the overall architecture of Webdirver and each browser implmentations.
[16:19:23] jimevans: and that's far different from claiming to be "not a developer"
[16:19:36] Manoj: read from AOSA.com where SimonStewart have written.
[16:20:04] RossPatterson: Yeah, http://www.aosabook.org/en/selenium.html is a good read.
[16:20:06] *jimevans is on a crusade to get people to realize writing code is writing code, and that if you're automating stuff with webdriver, you're a f-ing developer, whether your job title says it or not.
[16:20:10] Manoj: Apple, have really doesnt let any info on the Safari Architecture.
[16:20:38] Ardesco: yup, but it's got a lot of webkit underneath it
[16:20:50] Manoj: so that;s the reason we implement through extension. That extension works through JavaScript again
[16:20:55] Ardesco: http://www.webkit.org/projects/webkit/index.html
[16:21:24] Ardesco: i need to spend more time learning it :)

[16:24:10] Ardesco: :(
[16:24:23] *intchanter-work hands jimevans a virtual hundred dollars toward the campaign.
[16:24:41] Manoj: Doesn't Apple really uses Selenium for testing their apps and didnt feel short of the capabilities of SafariDriver when compared to others.
[16:26:03] Manoj: hopesully some in-house developer support would be of huge help.
[16:26:45] Ardesco: i doubt they do
[16:26:47] Manoj: Alright, heading to home from my workplace. will join after a hour or 2. 
[16:27:04] Ardesco: and apple aren't really interested in providing code to safari driver from what i've heard
[16:27:04] Manoj: you mean they use selenium ?
[16:27:16] Ardesco: i doubt it
[16:27:44] jimevans: anybody heard if there's been any movement on the "remote-debugger-based chromedriver" proposal?
[16:27:47] Ardesco: they may have been more eager to provide code for the safari driver if they iused it
[16:27:59] Manoj: yup. heard a while back about this. Not ready to expose their architecture of safari #patentissue
[16:28:33] Ardesco: because safari's implementation of WebKit is sooo different to everybody else'sâ€¦

[19:34:37] jarib: AutomatedTester: https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir-webdriver/jobs/3533959
[19:34:56] simonstewart: Right. Fine. I'm breaking out the profanobot
[19:35:04] jimevans: simonstewart: jleyba brought it up! :)
[19:35:05] jarib: i'm at 4% battery, changing location, bb30m :)
[19:35:30] simonstewart: ftr, I'm coming round to special-casing getText on INPUT and TEXTAREA elements because people struggle with basic concepts
[19:35:41] simonstewart: jarib runs off batteries?
[19:37:06] AutomatedTester: jarib: I had that when trying to solve the executeScript with dictionary but solved it
[19:37:12] AutomatedTester: well solved it for my test case
[19:37:13] jleyba: simonstewart: I won't complain if the special behavior is limited to when you call getText on INPUT and TEXTAREA directly
[19:37:16] llaskin: commit bit dinner
[19:37:30] jleyba: Just as long as they're excluded from traversals
[19:37:56] simonstewart: jleyba: you should read the :log from yesterday when I pretended to be you and me talking to each other

[19:38:20] barancev: I always surmised jarib is a cyborg, a human can't write so rapid and clean code :)
[19:39:02] jleyba: How should WebDriver handle window.onbeforeunload?
[19:39:17] simonstewart: As an alert
[19:39:29] jimevans: that would mean you have a method (getText()) that behaves differently based on whether it's called directly on an <input> or a <textarea> or on something else, *and* if the <something else> has an <input> or <textarea> in it, then things really get wonky.
[19:39:48] simonstewart: Yes, yes that would be the case
[19:39:54] jleyba: jimevans: no, just two cases
[19:40:10] jleyba: jimevans: input.getText() would be an alias for getAttribute("value")
[19:40:15] Spanktar has joined #selenium
[19:40:26] jimevans: jleyba: no, i realize it's two cases from our point of view. from the user's point of view, it's a different animal.
[19:40:32] simonstewart: For INPUT and TEXTAREA only
[19:40:34] simonstewart: Right
[19:40:47] simonstewart: "getText" will sometimes include the text of form elements
[19:40:56] simonstewart: Because the text isn't really text
[19:40:57] simonstewart: It's the value
[19:41:02] *RossPatterson feels his head starting to explode.
[19:41:07] jleyba: yeah...
[19:41:22] jleyba: Ok, I'm staying in the INPUT/TEXTAREA = empty string camp
[19:41:24] t55e has left #selenium
[19:41:26] jimevans: there's a precedent for this, you know...
[19:41:34] jimevans: element.isSelected()
[19:41:59] lukeis: why did we get rid of element.getValue? ;)
[19:42:11] simonstewart: jleyba: not the text content of the textarea?
[19:42:26] simonstewart: jleyba: what about the case where a TEXTAREA has default text?
[19:42:38] jleyba: lukeis: b/c that is literally equivalent to getAttribute("value")
[19:43:07] simonstewart: lukeis: ^^
[19:43:08] simonstewart: That
[19:43:18] lukeis: i knowâ€¦ but it's less confusing for users
[19:43:30] jleyba: simonstewart: KISS.  getText on textarea/input is an empty string
[19:43:59] simonstewart: jleyba: but what about if the textarea has child nodes with nodetype == #text?
[19:44:14] simonstewart: As is the case with textareas with default text
[19:44:49] jleyba: executeScript("return arguments[0].textContent", textarea)
[19:44:52] jleyba: :)
[19:44:59] simonstewart: (Looks like we're going to need to special-case at least textareas)
[19:45:05] simonstewart: jleyba: right. That's what we do now
[19:45:31] jleyba: simonstewart: the default text is in the HTML ,but it's not rendered like other text nodes
[19:45:50] jleyba: so getText would need even more complexity to know not to apply the formatting transformations it does now
[19:46:24] simonstewart: Well, that's the other option: modify getText to always skip the text of a textarea
[19:46:35] jleyba: that's what we do now
[19:46:39] eranm has joined #selenium
[19:46:47] lukeis: that brings up a question in my head, do we format transform text from <pre> tags?

[19:49:06] jleyba: we do include the text content of a TEXTAREA
[19:49:20] simonstewart: That's what I thought
[19:49:27] simonstewart: Biab. Being called away for lunch,
[19:50:27] simonstewart: Decide amongst yourselves: modify getText to ignore the content of TEXTAREAs or special-case "getText" to get INPUT and TEXTAREA values when called with that element only (that is, when you do getText on a page, the value will be omitted)
[19:50:35] simonstewart: I'll read the history when I get back.
[19:55:29] lukeis: personally, i think it's working as is (in most browsers) just fine. getText on textarea with default text returns the value (always whether it's blank or pre-populated ~ but untransformed akin to <pre>), and that getAttribute("value") gets the accurate value of the field (which is displayed to users)â€¦ and I'll add something about this to Chapter03 of SeHQ
[19:56:10] jimevans: well, i just about have a working marionette driver in native .net.
[19:56:16] smccarthy2: is the GhostDriver in selenium 2.27.0 ? I couldn't find it, and didn't see it in the javadoc on selenium.googlecode.com , but I thought I remember a blog saying its going to be in 2.27.0
[19:56:40] barancev: lukeis: except for IE
[19:56:43] lukeis: smccarthy2: wrappers to launch it are in 2.27
[19:57:05] lukeis: you need to download phantomjs (well, build the one from master) and put it on your path
[19:57:23] smccarthy2: lukeis: awesome thanks.
[19:57:30] lukeis: barancev: i knowâ€¦ i think that is just a defect that needs to be worked out :)
[19:57:35] AutomatedTester: jimevans: nice
[19:57:44] AutomatedTester: btw, what's the mess you mentioned earlier?
[19:57:47] barancev: smccarthy2: http://phantomjs.org/release-1.8.html
[19:58:46] jimevans: AutomatedTester: the findElement command returns the element's id, rather than a json object with an "ELEMENT" property set to the id. that's going to make it difficult to return elements from a javascript function.
[19:58:47] lukeis: i will add a link to sehq downloads as soon as phantomjs 1.8 is released :)
[19:59:33] AutomatedTester: jimevans: raise a bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Testing&component=Marionette
[19:59:49] barancev: and we all hope sehq dns will be switched
[19:59:51] jimevans: can do.

[20:00:32] lukeis: barancev: it will be *soon* â€¦ simon gave me some details for the conversion, hopefully either he or I find some spare time to do it :)
[20:00:43] lukeis: sadly not 'simple'
[20:01:02] jimevans: AutomatedTester: i've also got to work out the process and profile management for it
[20:01:36] AutomatedTester: jimevans: process should be the same
[20:01:46] AutomatedTester: profile just needs the marionette profile bits
[20:01:54] AutomatedTester: prefs bits I mean
[20:02:03] jimevans: i tried running the existing firefox stuff on it, and firefox was crashing.
[20:02:33] AutomatedTester: whats the error?
[20:02:42] jimevans: particularly in the initial "launch to clean the temp profile" when we tried to launch with the "-silent" switch
[20:02:54] jimevans: i'll have to go back and repro it now.
[20:03:48] lukeis: -silent is why i don't want to have the release bacon again ;)

[20:11:53] AutomatedTester: jleyba: there was a trolling today on our webdriverjs promises on twitter
[20:12:31] jleyba: AutomatedTester: saw that.  they look at the first code block and start trolling instead of actually reading the text
[20:12:55] jleyba: which says "don't do that, it's too verbose"
[20:13:13] jimevans: oooh. missed the trolling.
[20:13:19] jarib: AutomatedTester: i think that failure is related to your change, the test is passing with 2.27.0.rc1 (released 2012-12-01)

[20:15:33] AutomatedTester: jleyba: is there anyway we can get our js stuff to not minify and obstificate? 
[20:15:44] jleyba: Which target?

[20:16:11] lukeis: has anyone spoken to mr. robinson that he should have kept reading in the wiki page?
[20:16:14] AutomatedTester: something like that
[20:16:56] jleyba: AutomatedTester: need to step away for a few, will take a look when I get back
[20:16:58] barancev: well, WDBS tests are on CI and running, time to bed, and I'll need some hep from santi to configure it properly
[20:17:27] jarib: barancev: was it you who fixed the stack trace regex for FF17? the stack trace here looks funky https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir-webdriver/jobs/3533952
[20:17:38] jarib: doesn't it?
[20:18:20] barancev: where is the stacktrace here?
[20:18:33] barancev: (I'm a Java man :) )
[20:18:53] barancev: aha, cyan text
[20:18:57] jarib: yeah
[20:19:57] barancev: it's almost the same as before, method names were absent before 17, it's not me, it's mozilla added them
[20:20:33] lukeis: ohâ€¦ *facepalm* i get his complaint now (about promise structure)
[20:20:59] *AutomatedTester mutters that using regex for error handling probably isnt a good idea
[20:21:24] jarib: barancev: what is the stuff at the end? /g, _/h, /< etc
[20:21:38] barancev: jarib: no idea, ask AutomatedTester :)
[20:21:47] AutomatedTester: what stuff?
[20:21:49] jarib: AutomatedTester: what is the stuff at the end? /g, _/h, /< etc
[20:21:54] barancev: I think these are names of anonymous functions
[20:22:00] AutomatedTester: end of what?
[20:22:08] jarib: AutomatedTester: the stack trace here https://travis-ci.org/watir/watir-webdriver/jobs/3533952
[20:22:43] AutomatedTester: jarib: no idea
[20:23:00] AutomatedTester: maybe jleyba can tell you
[20:23:35] stephend: anyone else here using 2.27.0 on Grid?
[20:23:37] barancev: that's what Firefox puts in the stack trace as method names
[20:23:38] AutomatedTester: once its in driver_component.js its a mystery to me
[20:24:08] AutomatedTester: stephend: why whats wrong?
[20:24:25] stephend: AutomatedTester: session issues, and we don't have the typical hanging Firefox build
[20:24:39] stephend: "session wasn't assigned an external key"
[20:24:57] stephend: it's a "beforeRelease" call
[20:25:04] AutomatedTester: stephend: did you upgrade them all at the same time?
[20:25:04] stephend: haven't seen it before or in a long time
[20:25:06] stephend: yeah
[20:25:10] stephend: we're on 16
[20:25:16] stephend: haven't installed 17 yet
[20:25:23] stephend: but that should still work?

[20:25:41] stephend: trying to isolate it with clean runs in-between meetings

[20:34:37] jleyba: works in the safari driver
[20:35:02] jarib: i think because we're passing real elements around at that point
[20:35:13] *jarib doesn't really know
[20:35:37] AutomatedTester: jleyba: because the passing elements fails that way

[20:55:43] jleyba: no

[20:56:27] jleyba: if (false, true) { console.log("yes"); } else { console.log("no"); }
[20:56:30] jleyba: prints yes

[20:57:13] jleyba: one of those things you should never use yourself and leave it to minimizers
[20:57:17] stephend: there was a startup change, iirc?

[21:10:50] simonstewart: Unless there's consensus? 
[21:10:57] nirvdrum: simonstewart: Where you stole my counter-proposal and pitched it as your own :-P
[21:11:01] AutomatedTester: but one thing I didnt make abundantly clear is that this goes out the window the minute we rely on Mozilla
[21:11:38] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: I know I've joked about this before, but seriously, why can't they just settle on an API for more than 6 weeks?
[21:12:09] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: which API in particular
[21:12:16] AutomatedTester: as an example
[21:12:18] nirvdrum: Whatever one keeps breaking the driver.
[21:13:42] jimevans: now i've got to figure out where to stash this marionette driver until i can use it against a non-debug build.
[21:14:08] lukeis: jimevans: github ;)
[21:14:13] jimevans: AutomatedTester: can i cause marionette to listen on an arbitrary port?
[21:14:28] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: the last 2 blockers were 1: Mozilla  2 versions ago enforced tighter security on passing objects from addons to content which we didnt notice. Marionette is not affected. 2: we are using regex to parse errors from the browser. Mozilla added more meaningful data to the errors which broke our regex
[21:14:34] AutomatedTester: jimevans: thats managed by a pref
[21:14:35] jimevans: (the name of "defaultPrefs.port" is confusin)
[21:15:01] AutomatedTester: marionette.defaultPrefs.port is confusing?
[21:15:30] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Gotcha.  I guess it would just be nice to guarantee API compatibility for an ESR cycle or so.
[21:15:42] jimevans: well, the use of "default" in the name would imply there might be another set it's actually using. at least that's how i'd interpret it. but whatever, i'm happy to use it, whatever it's called.
[21:16:06] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: marionette has special privledge to land on all the channels atm
[21:16:13] AutomatedTester: well, dont think the ESR for now
[21:16:30] AutomatedTester: but by the time we do opt builds with marionette it will be there
[21:16:49] AutomatedTester: jimevans: Mozilla conventions to pref
[21:16:58] AutomatedTester: afaik
[21:17:51] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: I, and my team and tree sheriffs, are landing Marionette patches from beta through nightly
[21:18:21] nirvdrum: I've done a tremendously shitty job of tracking Marionette.
[21:18:28] nirvdrum: Is there a status doc someplace?

[21:25:08] *AutomatedTester will write a blog post why I think Firefox OS is the direction of the future even if it flops
[21:26:39] lukeis: JS based OS?
[21:26:55] AutomatedTester: no, its nothing to do about the tech stack
[21:27:38] jleyba: AutomatedTester: will Marionette execute a command if a page has an open XHR request or an open WebSocket?
[21:27:50] AutomatedTester: jleyba: should do
[21:28:05] AutomatedTester: jleyba: we're a TCP connection in the backend
[21:28:18] AutomatedTester: we use the remote debugger in Firefox
[21:28:32] AutomatedTester: we're just a different actor
[21:28:37] jleyba: right, but I believe the current FxDriver will see the open XHR and wait for it to finish before executing a command
[21:28:45] jleyba: just curious if that was carried over
[21:29:11] AutomatedTester: XHR from the content to client binding or to AUT?
[21:30:41] *AutomatedTester builds Firefox OS... again
[21:30:41] jleyba: should be the same?  any XHR sent from the current page
[21:31:13] AutomatedTester: um, tbh I dont know if we still monitor that
