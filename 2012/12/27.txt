[08:00:44] Anil has joined #selenium
[08:01:49] Anil: hi All, i'm trying to click on a submit button which lies inside a <form element. The issue is that the <form element doesn't have an 'id'. How should I handle this scenario (i.e submit the form)
[08:02:00] Anil: I'm using webdriver API in Java
[08:02:21] millenium has joined #selenium
[08:04:50] Anil: when i try to submit this form element in the webdriver code, it works:  <form method='get' id='sortfrm' action='/do/quicksearch/search' onsubmit='try{return sptab.doPage(event,"quicksearch");}catch(ex){alert(ex);}'>
[08:05:06] Anil: but, this doent' <form method="post" name="paging" action="/do/quicksearch/search" onsubmit="try{return sptab.doPage(event,&quot;quicksearch&quot;);}catch(ex){alert(ex);}">
[08:05:33] Anil: the only difference that i see in both these tags is that the first one has an 'id' , but the second doesn't
[08:05:56] Anil: both these <form elements have a 'submit' button inside them
[08:07:23] admc1 has joined #selenium
[08:08:45] Anil: when i say the second version doesn't work, what i mean, is that its not considering the other child elements inside that form as input, it so, simply takes the previous values and refreshes and comes back to the same page....the actual values that will take it to the next page are under that <form
[08:10:21] Anil: which doent' have an 'id', or probably, i'm totally off target
[08:11:56] Anil: anyone can please help...

[08:30:58] Anil: hi zeljkof
[08:31:03] Anil: hi SamuraiJack_
[08:31:12] Anil: can you plese help me with my issue?
[08:37:44] Anil: hi zeljkof
[08:38:48] zeljkof: hi Anil 
[08:39:06] Anil: I'm trying to write a test case for pagination functionality
[08:39:53] Anil: the <form tag for pagination that has the 'submit' button/s is not having a 'id', unlike other <form tags, so the children are not being referred to, during form submission, and the default values are being taken and even though the server is being contacted, we remain in the same page, as the pagination logic values are stored inside the elements of the <form tag
[08:40:05] Anil: zeljkof: what can I do in this scenario?
[08:40:22] Anil: <form tag has 'name' not an 'id'
[08:40:27] zeljkof: can you post link to the page or provide relevant HTML?
[08:40:55] Anil: <form method="post" name="paging" action="/do/quicksearch/search" onsubmit="try{return sptab.doPage(event,"quicksearch";);}catch(ex){alert(ex);}">
[08:41:51] zeljkof: is "action" attribute unique on the page
[08:41:54] zeljkof: ?
[08:42:06] Anil: no
[08:42:16] Anil:  <form method='get' id='sortfrm' action='/do/quicksearch/search' onsubmit='try{return sptab.doPage(event,"quicksearch");}catch(ex){alert(ex);}'>
[08:42:23] Anil: there is another form in the same page like that
[08:42:50] zeljkof: does the form have a parent element that has something unique?
[08:43:15] Anil: one min please
[08:45:51] Anil: both those form elements are under the same parent  <div class="rc_lc_cont" id="rc_lc_cont">
[08:47:48] zeljkof: :)
[08:47:56] testingb0t has joined #selenium
[08:48:14] zeljkof: Anil: how do _you_ know which form is the one you want
[08:48:34] Anil: actually the paging form , which is what i want is , under a <div class="mult lp10 vp10 mb5 f12" style="border-bottom:1px #787878 dotted;">
[08:48:36] zeljkof: is it always the second one, or the first one, does it have unique text...?
[08:48:42] Anil: but, that <div doesn't have a id
[08:49:16] Anil: i'm trying to click on the 'next' button of the pagination form
[08:50:01] zeljkof: ok, so next button is unique?
[08:50:07] Anil: yes, it is
[08:50:13] Anil: i'm able to click on that button
[08:50:18] zeljkof: I mean, there is only one button with text "next" on the page
[08:50:25] Anil: yes, right
[08:50:38] zeljkof: why don't you just click the button then?
[08:50:51] Anil: the pagination logic is stored in other <input elements under that <form which doens't have 'id'
[08:51:02] zeljkof: with watir-webdriver it is something like: browser.button(:text => "Next").click
[08:51:07] Anil: so, it is actually contacting the server , but not considering the elements under that <form
[08:51:20] Anil: 'clicking' is not the issue here
[08:51:55] Hronom has joined #selenium
[08:52:08] Anil: the 'next' page logic is not happening as the elements inside the <form (which has no 'id') are not being considered, so, i get back the same page from the server
[08:52:30] zeljkof: ok, so clicking the button does not do the job, you have to submit the form?
[08:52:42] Anil: yes
[08:53:14] zeljkof: are you using watir-webdriver?
[08:53:45] Anil: selenium web driver using java
[08:53:52] Anil: this is the next button <input type="submit" name="nextbutton" onclick="this.form.elem=this" class="pgsel" value="Next »" style="width:50px;"></div><div style="margin-bottom: 35px;"></div></form>
[08:54:07] zeljkof: Anil: I have never used Java :)
[08:54:11] zeljkof: I can not help you there
[08:54:20] Anil: its not about coding, its about logic
[08:54:44] zeljkof: but it should be possible to use xpath or css selectors to select parent form if you know a child button
[08:55:14] Manoj has joined #selenium
[08:55:45] Anil: actually, if you look at the code there for the 'Next >>' button, I dont understand what he is doing on 'onclick'
[08:55:54] Anil: simply setting some element value?
[08:56:13] Anil: and since the type is 'submit' it automatically submits the form
[08:56:18] Manoj: :log

[08:56:54] Anil: so, i've to 'click' on 'Next' and also, 'submit' the form
[08:57:30] zeljkof: Anil: ok, and what is the problem?
[08:57:38] zeljkof: you can first click the button, then submit the form
[08:59:00] Anil: ok, so, I've to click on the button first, then, get the <form element in the code and call submit....
[08:59:25] Anil: but, once i click on 'Next' the page is refreshing, thats the issue
[08:59:33] koshie_ has joined #selenium
[08:59:35] koshie_: Hi
[08:59:35] Anil: that means, the request is sent to the server
[08:59:56] zeljkof: Anil: I do not understand the problem
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Dec 27 09:00:01 2012]
[09:00:01] koshie_: Is it the IRC channel of selenium, the robot framework library ?
[09:00:32] Anil: zeljkof: i should not be clicking on the "Next" button, because the request will be sent to the server
[09:00:34] Manoj: Anil: try locating with name="nextbutton"
[09:00:37] zeljkof: Anil: you should talk to a developer, asking what should happen to go to the next page
[09:00:57] koshie_: I think so :)
[09:01:01] Manoj: i didnt knw the exact problem...but just pured my thought.
[09:01:25] Manoj: koshie_: Yes this is the official Selenium IRC channel
[09:01:43] Anil: zeljkof: I must be able to get the 'onclick' functionality of the 'Next' button and then, submit the form
[09:01:47] koshie_: What is the good keywords to run firefox with the mozilla binary ? (My debian doesn't have the Firefox release I want)
[09:01:56] Anil: not click on the 'Next' button
[09:02:03] koshie_: The path is : /home/koshie/firefox-10/firefox
[09:02:45] Anil: so, I need to execute JavaScript then, submit the form
[09:02:47] Anil: ok
[09:03:02] Anil: this.form.elem = this + <form submit
[09:03:11] Anil: ok guys, i'll try , Thanks
[09:04:00] Anil: I think this.form.elem is referring to the 'Next' button
[09:04:07] Anil: upon click
[09:04:21] Anil: ok, will try, thanks guys

[11:01:27] Anil: my clickingOnPage() function never takes me to the next page :(
[11:03:13] Anil: the headers are in this paste http://fpaste.org/HyE3/
[11:03:57] Anil: I thought its something to do with the <form tag not having 'id' , but that was not the case
[11:04:23] Anil: zeljkof: still there?
[11:05:31] Anil: can someone please help me?...
[11:05:34] zeljkof: Anil: yes, I took a look at your code, but Java is not my game
[11:06:32] Anil: zeljkof: is it possible for you to convert that same code into your programming language and test once? (as the events and the xpaths are already mentioned in my code)
[11:06:55] Anil: zeljkof: if you got your environment setup ready i.e
[11:07:29] Anil: I really dont think its a java issue, but something the html + javascript code are working together

[11:14:23] Anil: zeljkof: ok....thanks
[11:15:21] Anil: zeljkof: if you can inspect the html elements and simply browse through my code and tell me if i'm doing anything wrong...that would be helpful ...you might catch something that i'm doing wrong
[11:15:37] Anil: zeljkof: the URL is in the code itself

[12:05:36] milligan has joined #selenium
[12:06:35] Dude-X_: This looks like selenium RC instead of webdriver.  I only know the webdriver API
[12:07:05] Anil: please look at clickingOnPage() function, it only uses webdriver API
[12:07:21] Anil: thats where i'm facing the issue
[12:09:34] Anil: i'm missing something in my understanding of the html + javascript/ajax code being used in the URL mentioned in that code
[12:09:43] Dude-X_: First question I have is are you that's the right Xpath?
[12:09:52] Anil: yes
[12:10:13] Anil: you can infact open the url in the code and do a 'inspect element'
[12:10:13] Dude-X_: Ok. And it's a JavaScript widget next button?
[12:10:28] Anil: its a <input type='submit'
[12:10:38] Dude-X_: Is it a unique Xpath ?
[12:10:42] Anil: yes
[12:10:42] Mox[NL]: I don't know JAVA that good, but can you do that new Actions(driver).moveToElement ? create a 'new' instance and execute a method at the same time?
[12:11:19] Anil: Mox[NL], yes, we can, infact that part of the code is working fine, 
[12:11:37] Dude-X_: The wiki tells you  how to set up an action chain 
[12:11:39] Anil: i see the page scrolling down to the pagination <from
[12:13:23] Anil: even the next_button.click() works fine, just that it wont display the next set of results.....gives me back the same result set
[12:13:37] Dude-X_: Typically when you want to interact with fancy Ajax or JS widgets 
[12:14:21] Dude-X_: You would have to use a combo of executing JavaScript and native webdriver commands to interact with it
[12:15:39] Anil: here is the form tag, <form method="post" name="paging" action="/do/quicksearch/search" onsubmit="try{return sptab.doPage(event,&quot;quicksearch&quot;);}catch(ex){alert(ex);}" novalidate="true">
[12:15:44] Anil: I notice it has no 'id'
[12:15:58] Anil: so, i was trying to add a 'id' and then 'click', but didn't help
[12:16:39] Mox[NL]: just asking the obvious, but manually clicking the button works?
[12:16:53] Anil: Mox[NL] : You are right, it works
[12:17:30] Anil: manual --> works...............my_code --> *functionality broken*
[12:17:58] Mox[NL]: same browser?
[12:18:10] Anil: yes, Firefox
[12:19:55] Mox[NL]: Just a random idea: get the position of the button and let selenium click that position?
[12:20:18] Anil: Mox[NL]: you mean, instead of using xpath?
[12:20:31] Mox[NL]: you can use xpath to locate the button
[12:20:46] Anil: I'm already doing that
[12:20:54] Mox[NL]: then get the location from the button
[12:21:06] Anil: next_button = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@name='nextbutton']"));
[12:21:09] Anil: oh ok
[12:21:18] Anil: just a min, will let you know

[12:28:54] Anil: Mox[NL] : I just verified that getLocation would return org.openqa.selenium.Point
[12:29:05] Anil: but, click() is available for WebElement only
[12:29:28] fire: Anil: cool :)
[12:29:52] Anil: so, even if I get the Point, I can't click on that, i'll have to find the element at that point and click on it...which would be the same thing as what i'm doing now
[12:31:06] Anil: Mox[NL]: are you there?
[12:31:14] Anil: fire: can you help me with my issue ?
[12:31:59] fire: Anil: if i can surely i will.
[12:32:22] Mox[NL]: Hmmm, didn't know if it is possible to click on a point or not... I assumed it was

[12:56:30] Anil: RossPatterson: hi
[12:59:23] Mox[NL]: Anil: what happens if you execute the onsubmit code directly from selenium?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Dec 27 13:00:26 2012]
[13:00:26] Anil: I tried submitting the <form also, didn't work....before that, i changed the type of the 'Next' 'submit' to 'button' , clicked on it, and then, submitted the form, 
[13:00:42] Anil: the form gets submitted, but the next set of results not shown
[13:00:42] Mox[NL]: I mean using execute_script (in ruby)
[13:02:15] Anil: actually, I see that , upon the <form submit, the results are being updated in another <div which is not part of the <form tag
[13:03:18] Anil: hmm....I'm not a front-end UI developer...so, i've these missing logic
[13:03:59] Anil: the <form tag is only for the pagination part of it, so, the contents of the upper <div.....how are they getting refreshed is something that i dont know...
[13:04:07] Anil: Mox[NL] : any inputs on that please?
[13:05:26] Mox[NL]: in ruby I would do : driver.execute_script("try{return sptab.doPage(event,&quot;quicksearch&quot;);}catch(ex){alert(ex);")
[13:06:21] smccarthy has joined #selenium
[13:07:04] Anil: Mox[NL], I can do that part, but, should i not update some items/elements/values in the <form tag children?
[13:07:24] Anil: Mox[NL]: i'll do this
[13:07:35] Anil: 1) change the 'submit' (Next) to 'Button'
[13:07:45] Anil: 2) click on Next button
[13:07:55] Anil: 3) execute the script 
[13:08:04] Anil: one min please, will let you know

[19:09:09] regex: Yeah.  So I liked your code and have been patiently studying RossPatterson.  So I did a base object abstract class and than extended it with like a Table class...
[19:09:33] regex: class Table : BaseObject 
[19:09:37] RossPatterson: OK
[19:10:02] regex: public IWebElement TableTag { get; set; }   public Table(IWebElement objectName, IWebElement tableTag) : base(objectName)
[19:10:38] RossPatterson: If there's more than just a couple of lines, you probably want to use something like :gist to show it.
[19:10:38] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[19:10:49] regex: My question is:  Is this a reasonable strategy?  Where should I put my general logic for all elements.  Ideally in the BaseObject abstract class right?
[19:12:09] regex: https://gist.github.com/4391131
[19:13:06] RossPatterson: What we do is to put the behaviors that are peculiar to an element type in the specific element class.  For example, the SelectElement class handles the select-an-option operation, but the ElementBase superclass handles common operations like Click(),  When a Click() means something special (like turning off another radio button), we override the behavior in the subclass.
[19:15:19] RossPatterson: OK, so that makes sense as the object that represents a table.
[19:16:21] regex: Alright.  I'm just totally ensuring I'm stepping along the correct path here.  Why doesn't "findElements" compile in C#?  
[19:16:24] RossPatterson: Then you'd want to use it to build an object representing a page that has a table in it - similar to my LoginPage class from https://gist.github.com/4382969
[19:16:24] lukeis: i like to call that the widget pattern ;)
[19:17:30] RossPatterson: Dunno - that should be a call to IWebElement.findElements(), which sounds (off the top of my head) correct.
[19:18:05] lukeis: FindElements* i believe
[19:18:31] RossPatterson: lukeis: That would make sense, using normal C# conventions.
[19:20:24] lukeis: findElements / FindElements / find_elements  ;) yay for language specific conventions
[19:33:32] jleyba_ has joined #selenium
[19:35:25] regex: Thanks.  How do I convert this to C#?  IWebElement headerRow = tableRows.get(0);
[19:35:40] regex: The .get(0) isn't working..
[19:36:28] RossPatterson: regex: Have you coded C# in the past?
[19:36:43] regex: I have.
[19:37:43] RossPatterson: Well, if you have a List<something> x, the first element of x is x[0], not x.get(0).
[19:38:07] barancev|2: C# is not Java, despite some similarities :)
[19:38:32] lukeis: damn java getters/settersâ€¦ *mumble grumble*
[19:40:00] regex: It's the first index of the array instead of using the .get in Java. 
[19:40:34] regex: Yes.  Thank you.  
[19:40:55] RossPatterson: Right - so instead of tableRows.get(0), you use tableRows[0].
[19:40:56] barancev: Java is noisy, but there is groovy. and scala
[19:41:33] barancev: and jruby. and jython ;)

[23:04:05] cgoldberg: in a test fixture, you generally create an object in setup, do all your test methods, then cleanup/teardown to original state... every test method has access to driver
[23:04:29] lukeis: that's silly talk...

[23:10:35] lukeis: next ughâ€¦ setup is only on the suite definition, not on the class heirachy, so, running an individual test doesn't do all the setup required. Good lord...

I wonder if there's much gain to be had with a parallel runner
[23:18:57] jleyba: fwiw we only parallelize test jobs here
[23:19:06] lukeis: only if you have enough vm's to run the browsers
[23:19:36] jleyba: we limit the VMs to one browser session at a time so we have more consistent performance
[23:19:39] cgoldberg: jleyba, meaning all your test runs use paralleization?
[23:20:22] lukeis: i don't mind batching the parallelism to jobs or suites, just having it easy to do either is beneficial in my mind...
[23:20:53] jleyba: lukeis: the magic of "just works" is definitely important
[23:21:02] lukeis: yessir
[23:21:24] lukeis: currently nothing works ;) so, I get to tear out the engine and rebuild
[23:21:42] jleyba: I'm running out of stuff to do this week
[23:21:51] lukeis: the week is almost up...
[23:21:55] jleyba: Everyone took time off so I've got code reviews piling up
[23:22:25] cgoldberg: i mean.. you can get away with totally serial test runs per browser.. but have a distributed CI system that executes serial runs in parallel on different nodes/vm's
[23:22:25] lukeis: go home early? :)
[23:22:50] cgoldberg: i'm just wondering if local parallelization actually gains you any reduction in execution time
[23:23:03] lukeis: cgoldberg: we have that for our iOS stuff, parameterized builds in jenkins to do the parallelization
[23:23:42] lukeis: only gain is if you can launch a browser per test on it's own vmâ€¦ if you have enough vm's for every test, then yes :)
[23:23:57] cgoldberg: yea.. i use jenkins with build slaves and multiple executors
[23:24:00] lukeis: thread limit == number of vm's ;)
[23:24:40] lukeis: at least that's how I had it in my last position...
[23:25:03] lukeis: i think you get the picture of the horror i'm trying to wrangle currently :-D
[23:25:03] cgoldberg: but.. it might help developers (who run selenium acceptance tests locally with a single browser).. if the suite time was cut down even somewhat

[23:25:48] regex: One last question...How could I change this tagName to look for the css equivalent of tables.
[23:25:50] cgoldberg: hmm.. i need to do some benchmarks and monitoring with parallelized test cases
[23:25:52] lukeis: locally if you don't have much problems running multiple browsers at the same time, i found the efficient number of threads to be between 3 and 5
[23:25:58] jleyba: you could make it configurable so devs can change it at runtime
[23:26:40] lukeis: regex: what? 
[23:26:43] regex: TableTag.FindElements(By.TagName("tr"));  Should I just go By.Css("css = td")) ?
[23:26:54] cgoldberg: lukeis, jleyba, right.. but my question is... no matter what you set it to.. is there any actual reduction in total runtime
[23:27:04] lukeis: regex: By.Css("tr")
[23:27:09] cgoldberg: if no: then not worth implementing for me
[23:27:09] jleyba: cgoldberg: yes
[23:27:35] jleyba: there should be some savings, but it really depends on how heavy your tests are
[23:27:39] lukeis: cgoldberg: if you currently only have 1 thread, then yes > 1 < 5 is faster
[23:28:11] lukeis: 1 < threads < 5   on normal dev desktops
[23:28:22] cgoldberg: my tests are primarily cpu bound, with most of my cycles going towards browser startup
[23:28:30] farlan has joined #selenium
[23:28:45] cgoldberg: so i'm having a hard time seeing how adding parallel instances would help
[23:29:08] lukeis: do you tear down / setup a browser for every test?
[23:29:14] lukeis: when running locally?
[23:29:14] cgoldberg: lukeis, yup
[23:29:23] cgoldberg: always always
[23:29:24] *lukeis keeps them up for dev runs
[23:29:47] lukeis: then i become memory bound ;)
[23:30:35] lukeis: you can clear cookies (which is cheaper than tearing down / starting up a browser) that will work for 90% of the cases
[23:31:37] cgoldberg: interesting, but 10% flakiness is too high :)
[23:31:54] lukeis: when you're watching locally, sometimes not...
[23:32:07] lukeis: but it all depends on what you are doing
[23:32:24] lukeis: all your test cases may fall into the 90% category ;)
[23:32:47] cgoldberg: actually.. i bet a dev/local "don't restart" might cut down time significantly.. and Jenkins/CI can still do proper setup/teardown.  I might have to try that and see how well it works
[23:34:50] lukeis: don't forget to clean up 'extra' windows that may haven been left around, and try to keep the primary window handle (some popups stip out the toolbar/ etc.)
[23:37:32] cgoldberg: actually.. sounds dangerous the more i think of it
[23:37:34] regex: thank you lukeis  
[23:37:52] lukeis: cgoldberg: it isâ€¦ but i live dangerously ;)
[23:37:58] cgoldberg: hah!
[23:43:58] cgoldberg: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3scvdb/
[23:44:05] cgoldberg: lukeis ^^
[23:44:13] lukeis: heh :)
[23:44:51] lukeis: honestly i had more troubles with data setup / overlap of tests than with the reusing of a browser
[23:45:40] lukeis: and it even uncovered some *nasty* concurrent user bugs
