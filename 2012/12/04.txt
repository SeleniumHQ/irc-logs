[00:09:29] redfive-c2g: With the 2.26 version of selenium, should I be seeing a jetty version of 5.1?
[00:10:21] redfive-c2g: Hello?
[00:12:48] adamgoucher: jetty is what runs the server, so its quite possible that you see that
[00:13:29] redfive-c2g: It just looks like they are on a newer version (via the jetty site) so I was wondering if it was know that selenium 2.26 is still using an older verison
[00:13:48] redfive-c2g: or am I somehow finding a different version on my machine somewhere (I doubt it)
[00:14:51] adamgoucher: its known. its been hacked on
[00:15:55] redfive-c2g: okay.
[00:16:08] redfive-c2g: Yeah, my machine shows no trace of jetty
[00:20:47] adamgoucher: the standalone server is, erm, well, standalone so it doesnt mater what you have on there
[00:27:47] redfive-c2g: adamgoucher: I assumed, but I'm grasping at straws here. Now I think it may be selenose framework that is dropping the connection before it tries to delete the session and jetty is already dropping the session
[00:30:25] redfive-c2g: sweet, found an issue related to it

[01:23:39] sassda: I am having pbs with iframe in IE9, it seems I can't switch to a dynamically created iframe, what is funny though, is that if I make a findelement on the iframe it works, its just aht when switching to it, I get the erro message "No Frame found"
[01:23:48] sassda: anyone got something like that?
[01:43:50] adamgoucher: do you have a repeatable, public, test case to reproduce it?
[01:44:13] adamgoucher: (and have you tried with the most recent ieserver -- which is about 7 hours old now)
[01:53:59] sassda: oh 7 hours old, no mine is like 5 days old, lemme try and then work on that public testcase :)
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Dec  4 02:02:36 2012]
[02:02:36] sassda: ok, no luck with the newest driver, although it does seems faster than before
[02:02:58] sassda: for the public testcase, you would need to install a browser plugin, is that ok/

[03:47:54] simonstewart: plightbo: just looking at that DNS information
[03:47:58] simonstewart: Holy heck
[03:50:14] plightbo: :)
[03:53:11] simonstewart: Right. Given the vast number, I wonder if there's an easy way to do this
[03:53:16] *simonstewart heads off to Google
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Dec  4 04:00:10 2012]
[04:00:10] simonstewart: Right. Pinged 
[04:00:18] simonstewart: Or emailed for help. Let's see if that works
[04:07:15] *simonstewart wonders if there's a TinyDNS to BIND converter somewhere
[04:14:46] plightbo: simonstewart: lemme know
[04:15:01] plightbo: we can also just keep Contegix for DNS hosting and point Ghandi there
[04:16:19] simonstewart: Not found one yet, but I've emailed Gandi and pinged some SRE types that I know
[04:18:09] simonstewart: Hmmâ€¦ http://support.menandmice.com/jforum/posts/list/175.page
[04:18:51] plightbo: wow that's more involved than I expected
[04:19:13] simonstewart: http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/axfrdns.html
[04:24:25] plightbo: if you just want to move quickly, we can just ask contegix to keep hosting DNS and send them email requests to make changes
[04:24:28] plightbo: they are really fast
[04:24:39] plightbo: and it requires never having to learn about TinyDNS or BIND or anything else :)
[04:28:15] simonstewart: Pfft.
[04:28:18] simonstewart: Where's the fun in that
[04:28:20] simonstewart: ?
[04:28:44] simonstewart: dig @ns1.contegix.com. seleniumhq.org axfr
[04:28:54] simonstewart: Ares
[04:28:55] simonstewart: Arse
[04:29:00] simonstewart: That would have worked :)
[04:30:50] simonstewart: So, it looks like "all" i need to do is set up tinydns on my local machine, import the zone files and then do a axfr request on it
[04:30:52] simonstewart: Easy
[04:30:55] simonstewart: He says
[04:33:18] simonstewart: plighbo: I guess one option is to ask contegix to do that process for us
[04:33:27] simonstewart: _Everyone_ has dig, right?
[04:33:32] simonstewart: Ahhhâ€¦

[13:33:32] dawagner: What do they return?
[13:33:40] barancev: the same as getAttribute("value")
[13:33:56] dawagner: Ah maybe that's the one weird exception
[13:34:17] barancev: for a text field they return "", for a text area they return its text
[13:34:36] mreedell has joined #selenium
[13:34:54] barancev: is this exception documented?
[13:35:12] barancev: I'm asking because I can't find documentation
[13:35:49] barancev: :spec
[13:35:49] selbot2: http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html | http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/
[13:35:52] dawagner: Actually, I'm wrong, that's the correct behaviour
[13:36:01] dawagner: Because the innertext of the textarea element *is* its text
[13:36:17] dawagner: And I don't think (please correct me) a textarea has a value property, or attribute
[13:36:35] jarib: hmm. appears that our click() will happily scroll the element to a point where it's hidden by another element (e.g. rocket bar-style menu), then attempt to click there and accidentally hit a menu item
[13:36:38] jarib: sigh
[13:36:50] *jarib starts working on the reduced case
[13:37:31] dawagner: jarib: Yep :(
[13:37:34] dawagner: Floating elements are a bitch
[13:37:51] dawagner: I tried to solve the problem, but there was no efficient way to do so at a JS level
[13:37:56] jarib: hm
[13:38:30] dawagner: The only way I could work out involved iterating over every element in the DOM to calculate layering and find a truly visible portion of the screen
[13:38:42] dawagner: Which we'd need to do quite often
[13:38:44] jarib: right..
[13:38:44] barancev: dawagner: next question is -- what if I type into a text area -- should both getText() and getAttribute("value") return modified text?
[13:38:58] dawagner: barancev: I believe getText should, and getAttribute("value") should return ""
[13:39:04] jarib: dawagner: so what would you suggest for users who hit this problem?
[13:39:08] dawagner: What does getAttribute("value") actually do
[13:39:21] dawagner: jarib: Manually scroll the page using the actions api somehow?
[13:39:35] dawagner: Send a patch to the ChromeDriver which *does* know this information, to actually use it?
[13:40:21] barancev: dawagner: getAttribute("value") returns text of an area
[13:40:22] jarib: so if i manually scroll, click() won't scroll it further?
[13:40:26] *jarib tries
[13:40:34] dawagner: If an element *is* visible, it shouldn't be scrolled.

[13:42:50] jarib: no worries
[13:43:59] barancev: dawagner: a text area element has the "value" property, you can assign it and the visible text will be changed
[13:44:18] dawagner: Awesome.  In that case, the two should mirror each other.
[13:45:01] barancev: yes, and that was the second question -- what about typing? shoud it change "value" property, or text, or both?
[13:45:56] dawagner: Both
[13:46:03] barancev: and question number 3: what if some javascript on a page changes "value" property of a text area -- should getText() return the modified text or not?
[13:46:15] jamesoram has joined #selenium
[13:46:16] barancev: (inner text nodes are not changed in this case)
[13:46:25] dawagner: I would think it should
[13:46:32] dawagner: ooi what does innerText return in that case?
[13:49:32] barancev: dawagner: innerHTML is not changed if you assign "value"
[13:49:46] barancev: but the text visible to a user is changed
[13:50:20] barancev: textContent is not changed too
[13:51:37] barancev: if you type, textContent and innerHTML are remaining untouched, only value property is changing for a text area
[13:51:45] dawagner: Ick.

[14:07:20] barancev: should "onclick" for select element be activated automatically when selenium clicks on an option?

[20:24:11] jimevans: FalCone: i'm not sure i completely follow. the "could've been a popup" confused me.

[21:44:50] FalCone: Well, let's see.
[21:45:15] FalCone: I'm trying to screenshot specific ads on pages that I've crawled to under a given domain name
[21:45:21] stephend_ has joined #selenium
[21:45:32] FalCone: Problem is: 1. I can't get flash ads when I screenshot on anything but chrome
[21:45:41] FalCone: and 2. I need to have a page_load_timeout, but I can't have one on chrome
[21:45:48] FalCone: because assets might not load, etc.
[21:46:08] cgoldberg: screenshpts dopnt work in schrome?
[21:46:12] FalCone: they do
[21:46:16] FalCone: but flash objects don't render
[21:46:18] FalCone: on like
[21:46:20] FalCone: firefox or opera
[21:46:22] cgoldberg: schrome
[21:46:26] FalCone: Oh
[21:46:26] FalCone: uh
[21:46:29] jleyba: FalCone you could use a proxy with Chrome
[21:46:41] jleyba: And have the proxy terminate a request if it takes longer than you want
[21:46:50] FalCone: Yeah, but then wouldn't I have to configure a proxy?
[21:47:04] awilson820 has joined #selenium
[21:47:07] cgoldberg: you could wrire your own timeout
[21:47:43] FalCone: I tried doing a wonky multi-threaded timeout in python
[21:47:57] FalCone: Then again, I'd never done multithreading in python, so I probably goofed it.
[21:48:45] cgoldberg: FalCone, .. you can do something in one thread
[21:49:17] FalCone: In a way that emulates the set_page_load_timeout? :\
[21:49:28] FalCone: Been kinda bashing my head into a wall. Heh.
[21:49:41] cgoldberg: FalCone, or is the driver.get(url) blocked?
[21:50:05] FalCone: It locks up on .gets that are taking forever to load
[21:51:04] AutomatedTester: so...
[21:51:13] AutomatedTester: who wants a breakdown of the last blocker
[21:51:31] FalCone: Any hints, cgoldberg? :\

[21:52:02] AutomatedTester: stephend_: so we do so "clever" things when wanting to executeScript from webdriver
[21:52:59] cgoldberg: FalCone, actually nah.. was thinking u had a slightly diff problem
[21:53:10] FalCone: Blagh.
[21:53:14] AutomatedTester: what we do is create an anonymous function on the document and then we set some userdefined fields on the document from the addon and then our anonymous function pulls that info out and it cant handle dictionaries

[22:04:59] AutomatedTester: somewhere between https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/firefoxDriver.js#314 and https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/evaluate.js#21 it drops the hash and that is the blocker

[22:37:59] echocage: Can someone help me with a quick problem?
[22:38:25] AutomatedTester: still no joy?
[22:39:33] echocage: Actually i fixed it! :D Started using the Crome driver X) My question was, i'm making a tumblr follower bot, and everytime i click follow, it transfers me to their tumblr page, which takes a long time to load. is there anyway i can click the follow button but then stop the loading of the next page?
[22:41:31] echocage: So basically is there anyway to stop the loading of a page?
[22:43:58] FalCone: You mean like having a timeout for the loading of a page in chromedriver?
[22:44:03] FalCone: So that you don't have to wait for it to finish?
[22:44:25] FalCone: and/or emulating hitting the stop button?

[23:01:11] FalCone: Okay. So I figured out the most ass-backwards way to do this ever.
[23:01:29] FalCone: To ensure that I can do load_timeouts, and screenshot flash elements in chrome
[23:01:59] FalCone: Open opera browser, open Chrome browser, open opera to the domain in question, chrome to an inert URL like a 404. :|
[23:02:13] FalCone: Then feed it the innerHTML of the document from Opera when needed to  screenshto
[23:02:25] FalCone: That's really janky, and should never have been the case. lol.
[23:03:00] AutomatedTester: hadanza, nearly there
[23:04:14] FalCone: Aw poop
[23:04:19] FalCone: the ads are different each time :|

[23:21:55] *AutomatedTester hugs simonstewart
[23:22:02] AutomatedTester: the browsers are being mean to me
[23:22:12] simonstewart: What are they doing to you?
[23:22:26] AutomatedTester: adding security and protecting users
[23:22:30] AutomatedTester: and making my life hard
[23:22:51] simonstewart: Damn their eyes.
[23:23:00] simonstewart: That's why we need to be in the browser
[23:23:12] AutomatedTester: so I know what the last blocker is for 2.27
[23:23:23] AutomatedTester: just trying to think of a nice clean way to implement
[23:23:28] stephend: is that an actual bugzilla bug at this point?
[23:23:33] *stephend would like to follow along
[23:23:38] FalCone: Is it possible to get Opera or Firefox to actually render the flash objects so they'll show up when I do a screenshot with 'em?
[23:23:43] simonstewart: What's the problem?
[23:24:11] simonstewart: FalCone: be aware that flash is sometimes rendered in a borderless window rendered on to the screen where the area on the page is
[23:24:23] simonstewart: It _looks_ like part of the page, but it may not be.
[23:24:26] FalCone: Yeah.
[23:24:30] AutomatedTester: stephend: maybe
[23:24:31] FalCone: But when I'm on chrome it always shows up
[23:24:34] simonstewart: (which is why sometimes clicking on flash movies steals focus)
[23:24:34] AutomatedTester: not sure
[23:24:43] simonstewart: FalCone: I don't think that's deliberate
[23:24:51] AutomatedTester: stephend: if it does exist it doesnt get much traffic
[23:24:59] FalCone: Not sure, I just know that it supposedly works
[23:25:02] simonstewart: What's the bug?
[23:25:13] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: the 2.27 blocker wouldnt affect marionette
[23:25:28] simonstewart: See: that's my point
[23:25:40] simonstewart: Someone should write a spec about this stuff
[23:26:03] AutomatedTester: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XPConnect_wrappers the __exposedProps__ part
[23:26:38] simonstewart: Hmmmâ€¦ how is that hitting us?
[23:26:53] simonstewart: I can imagine "badly" and "all the time"
[23:27:27] AutomatedTester: if we send a hash from chrome to content without __exposedProps__ the browser puts a null there
[23:27:35] AutomatedTester: well more gives you a null if you try use it
[23:28:24] simonstewart: We don't do that often
[23:28:58] AutomatedTester: but when we do, its in a useful place
[23:29:03] AutomatedTester: like executeScript
[23:29:24] simonstewart: well, arse biscuits
[23:29:36] simonstewart: How long until Marionette is in the production builds?
[23:30:07] AutomatedTester: e.g. driver.execute_script("return arguments[0].foo", {"foo":"bar"}) will error saying foo is undefined
[23:30:30] AutomatedTester: I have, in principle, the agreement from infosec to get it into prod builds
[23:30:35] AutomatedTester: at least for desktop
[23:30:42] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[23:30:51] AutomatedTester: but this time thing is a pain
[23:30:57] AutomatedTester: there doesnt appear to be enough of it
[23:31:00] simonstewart: If there's a nested object within the arguments do we need to do more work?
[23:31:23] simonstewart: Or would it be enough to walk the arguments list with recursing into it to build the exported list?
[23:31:37] simonstewart: Hang on. I think I have some around here
[23:31:40] *simonstewart looks around
[23:31:42] simonstewart: Damn it.
[23:31:52] simonstewart: I'm sure I had a spare couple of hours here earlier
[23:31:53] AutomatedTester: so instead of sending over an object I was going to pass over a JSON.stringify string of the object and then JSON.parse on the content side
[23:32:12] AutomatedTester: in my head that should work
[23:32:15] simonstewart: What about elements?
[23:32:30] AutomatedTester: cock
[23:33:08] AutomatedTester: elements should be fine too
[23:33:10] simonstewart: Arse biscuits?
[23:33:20] AutomatedTester: since they are not complex objects
[23:33:26] simonstewart: uh
[23:33:38] simonstewart: They are by the time we executeScript
[23:33:43] simonstewart: Cos we dig 'em out
[23:34:12] AutomatedTester: so what I want to do is stringify https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/firefoxDriver.js#314
[23:34:28] AutomatedTester: and parse https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/firefox-driver/js/evaluate.js#21
[23:34:40] AutomatedTester: sod it, let me try 
[23:34:42] FalCone: auuuuuuuuuuuuugh http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=9
[23:35:09] simonstewart: FalCone: use firefox and set the page loading strategy
[23:35:33] FalCone: Flash objects don't appear in firefox screenshots :\
[23:35:43] FalCone: It's literally the only reason I'm using chrome. Hahah.
[23:40:05] lukeis: hiya simonstewart, noticed you chatting to plightbo_ yesterday about dns, does that mean some nominal progress on sehq? ;)
[23:40:24] FalCone: Pretty much these wonky little roadblocks are giving me grey hairs. Woop
[23:40:27] simonstewart: Nominal
[23:40:34] simonstewart: I think I need to spend some quality time with perl
[23:40:41] lukeis: :shudder:
[23:41:24] simonstewart: Look. I have to touch PHP professionally
[23:41:29] simonstewart: Perl is no worse
[23:43:29] *lukeis feels sorry for simonstewart on his umm, *strategic*? career choice
[23:43:42] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: damn you for being correct
[23:43:59] simonstewart: lukeis: "fun". That's why I'm here
[23:44:06] simonstewart: Although there's PHP, there's a ton of fun things to do
[23:44:27] simonstewart: I've already dabbled in more stuff here than I touched at google
[23:44:38] lukeis: nice
[23:45:05] *lukeis has had enough "fun" for today, later all
[23:45:41] simonstewart: Elements breaking things?
[23:45:45] AutomatedTester: yea
[23:46:06] AutomatedTester: hmm
[23:50:51] AutomatedTester: the way we can fix it is to walk the object and expose things we want
[23:51:02] FalCone: Screw it. Going home. I'll whine about the same thing tomorrow. Hahahah.
