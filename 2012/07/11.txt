[12:52:21] *stephend would love for that to be in firefox 16 or 17
[12:52:58] davehunt: AutomatedTester: It's causing some real issues for Web QA's scaling, so can I help to get it looked into sooner?
[12:53:14] eranm: davehunt, the first thing I'm checking is to see if my x_ignore_nofocus library may be interfering when the test mode is on. It should be unnecessary with the test mode. 
[12:53:16] stephend: yeah, we have too many jobs
[12:53:24] stephend: (that we have to support)
[12:53:37] stephend: eranm: is this linux-specific?
[12:53:59] eranm: stephend, yes. But if the same native tests are failing on Windows then it means it's a bigger problem
[12:54:06] *stephend nods
[12:54:22] eranm: Someone in the original bug description (moz#704583) said this patch only works for single-window instances
[12:55:33] *stephend reads it
[12:55:37] AutomatedTester: eranm: if you implement the event queue stuff then in theory we dont need the keyboard and mouse xpt
[12:57:24] eranm: AutomatedTester, correct
[12:57:28] davehunt: eranm: you mean this comment 'It should work for the most basic usage, but it won't handle other windows opening.'
[12:57:36] eranm: davehunt, exactly
[12:58:10] davehunt: eranm: so if I read that correctly, if a popup window is opened we wouldn't be able to pretend we had focus on the new window?
[12:58:41] davehunt: that sounds like a less than ideal limitation, but probably one that wouldn't limit us too much
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Jul 11 13:01:05 2012]
[13:01:05] eranm: davehunt, I'm not sure if a popwindow in that context is 
[13:01:13] eranm: davehunt, I'm not sure if a pop-up window in that context is a window
[13:01:43] eranm: The patch does take into care emulating lowering and rising of windows: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/742d5f9f284d#l1.171
[13:02:19] davehunt: eranm: okay, that's cool
[13:02:48] dawagner: Every time I send an email about jellybean, I want jellybeans.  WHY ARE THERE NO JELLYBEANS?
[13:02:57] davehunt: eranm: I believe Mozmill uses this mode and has been tested with multiple instances
[13:04:14] stephend: we used it with multiple instances too for a bit, iirc
[13:06:12] eranm: Well, it definitely breaks all native input tests.
[13:06:27] eranm: even when the x_ignore_nofocus library is not loaded
[13:06:48] davehunt: eranm: all == not just linux? :|
[13:07:37] eranm: davehunt, haven't tried Windows, but no typing happens when the test mode is turned on
[13:12:08] davehunt: So according to Henrik (Mozmill dev) that's probably the expected behavior. So the focusmanager pref is currently preventing user interactions
[13:12:35] davehunt: Seems odd to me
[13:16:02] AutomatedTester: my approach would be to try nsIDomWindowUtils first
[13:16:17] AutomatedTester: and then we can see about getting rid of the gecko downloads
[13:16:22] eranm: davehunt, AutomatedTester , stephend|phone : Do any of you have any idea what are the values that should be passed to nsIDOMWindowUtils.sendNativeKeyEvent ?

[13:35:10] davehunt: AutomatedTester: I thought focusmanager.testmode would allow Selenium to interact with a datepicker when Firefox is not in focus, is this not the case? Have I done something wrong?

[14:31:33] AutomatedTester: jimevans: means no more downloads of gecko
[14:31:53] jimevans: interesting. also means the common webdriver-interactions code is only used for IE then.

[16:24:56] AutomatedTester: scroat: https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/py/selenium/webdriver/chrome/options.py
[16:26:31] AutomatedTester: so opts = Options(); opts.add_argument("..."); chrome = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=opts)

[16:28:38] stephend: simonstewart: when you next in town, perchance?
[16:28:44] simonstewart: A couple of weeks
[16:28:47] stephend: any chance of being here around the end of august?
[16:28:48] stephend: ah
[16:28:54] simonstewart: I'm getting out of london for the olympics
[16:29:00] simonstewart: End? No. Beginning, yes
[16:29:04] simonstewart: How come?
[16:29:09] AutomatedTester: escaping the olympics
[16:29:26] Dude-X: isn't the story is that london is becoming super copyright cop during the olympics
[16:29:56] simonstewart: I have no intention of being here to find out
[16:30:18] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: yea, apparently the public bicycles cant go near the village because they are sponsored by someone that isnt an official sponsor
[16:30:24] AutomatedTester: good luck enforcing that
[16:30:47] dawagner: AutomatedTester: There's going to be a ring of army around the village
[16:30:52] dawagner: They can enforce that, if they want to
[16:31:20] AutomatedTester: *sigh*
[16:31:46] stephend: simonstewart: we're planning on having a work week then :-)
[16:31:54] stephend: which means davehunt and zac_sel will be in town :-)
[16:32:09] simonstewart: Gah!
[16:32:15] simonstewart: Where's zac_sel based?
[16:32:19] stephend: I had to fill out the TPS report, though
[16:32:35] zac_sel: dude-X, £12bn cost so far..!
[16:32:43] stephend: simonstewart: London!
[16:32:49] stephend: works out of our fine, cozy office
[16:32:55] stephend: have you yet visited?
[16:33:00] simonstewart: Yes I have
[16:33:06] simonstewart: I can head there again some time
[16:33:13] stephend: cool

[16:33:23] jimevans: where is browserVersion defined for the selenium emulation?
[16:33:33] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: zac_sel is the chap that came to lunch with us in your sales office once
[16:33:47] AutomatedTester: the australian chap
[16:33:49] simonstewart: Ah!
[16:33:52] simonstewart: Him!
[16:33:54] simonstewart: Brilliant.
[16:33:58] simonstewart: Names, faces. Faces, names
[16:34:02] simonstewart: and handles
[16:35:00] simonstewart: jimevans: how did you persuade IE to tell you the unicode char?
[16:35:21] jimevans: heh. i didn't. i coded the test in .NET and fired up the debugger. :)
[16:36:12] jimevans: examining the text gotten back from the getText() call is how i found it.
[16:36:51] simonstewart: What's the unicode character?
[16:36:55] simonstewart: 160?
[16:37:05] jimevans: i'm seeing 101.
[16:37:40] simonstewart: Isn't that an "e"?
[16:38:03] jimevans: hang on.
[16:38:36] jimevans: err. right. my substring is off by one.
[16:39:15] simonstewart: So, 160?
[16:40:02] jimevans: yeah. 160
[16:41:43] simonstewart: Great
[16:41:49] simonstewart: I think I have a fix
[16:42:07] simonstewart: Sadly, I have to run the server on my linux box in order to iterate on the test
[16:42:56] simonstewart: I'd just like to say a hearty *sigh* to IE
[16:43:48] scroat: AutomatedTester: how do you import the Options() ?
[16:44:11] AutomatedTester: scroat: from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
[16:44:28] *AutomatedTester should create a shortcut import 
[16:44:49] simonstewart: I appear to be checking out chrome
[16:44:52] simonstewart: From source
[16:44:56] simonstewart: This is going to be slow

[21:23:57] *jleyba hides
[21:24:20] jimevans: oh, you can run, but you can't hide. :)
[21:24:28] scroat: moin
[21:24:55] jimevans: jleyba: so i'm working on fixing the RC emulation tests for IE, and i've hit a snag.
[21:26:04] jimevans: in trunk/javascript/atoms/events/events.js, we create bot.events.EventType, with properties that are pre-created event factories.
[21:27:26] jleyba: oh yippee...events
[21:27:35] jimevans: the properties are the event names, like "BLUR", "CHANGE", etc.
[21:28:26] jleyba: getting w3c events instead of IE "on" events?
[21:28:38] jimevans: the selenium atoms (in trunk/javascript/selenium-atoms/events.js) attempt to use these properties to look up the pre-created event factory, but does it using a property lookup by event name (e.g., bot.events.EventType[eventName.toUpperCase()])
[21:29:16] jimevans: but the problem is that closure "optimizes" the property names on bot.events.EventType, so they no longer have the names of the events...
[21:29:24] llaskin has joined #selenium
[21:29:40] jleyba: Ah
[21:29:52] jleyba: by any chance are you trying to concatenate the output of two different atoms?
[21:29:56] jleyba: and then inject that?
[21:30:25] jimevans: no, this is just using the fireEvent atom.
[21:31:11] AutomatedTester: huzzah, getTitle for marionette lands on mozilla-inbound
[21:31:16] *AutomatedTester does a little dance
[21:32:41] jimevans: well, never mind. i'll just hack the selenium atom. there's already a fallback case for when it doesn't find the property in bot.events.EventType
[21:32:44] jleyba: Ah.. core.events.getEventFactory_ is wrong
[21:32:59] jimevans: AutomatedTester danced so hard he got booted!
[21:33:12] AutomatedTester has joined #selenium
[21:33:13] jimevans: jleyba: yeah, there's a string literal instead of property name in the fallback case.
[21:33:30] jimevans: i can fix that.
[21:33:47] jimevans: and add the type_ member that bot.events.fireEvent needs to work properly.
[21:34:10] jimevans: but i was hoping there'd be a way to use the preloaded ones.
[21:38:49] jleyba: I'd create an object that maps type to factory
[21:39:41] jleyba: bot.events.EventType is kind of misleading.  Should probably be named bot.events.EventFactory
[21:39:46] jimevans: i think that's the idea behind bot.events.EventType
[21:39:52] jleyba: it is
[21:40:08] jleyba: but you can't depend on those enum keys for use via reflection b/c they'd get compiled
[21:40:17] jimevans: my point exactly.
[21:40:30] jleyba: what target did you compile?
[21:40:41] chrisculver701 has joined #selenium
[21:40:50] jleyba: i don't think those keys should be renamed for Selenium RC...seems overly aggressive
[21:41:05] jimevans: ./go //javascript/selenium-atoms/findElement i think
[21:41:39] jimevans: it does seem overly aggressive to me, but i don't know closure well enough to fix it.
[21:41:47] jleyba: yeah, those atoms won't work as fragments
[21:41:47] jleyba: one sec
[21:42:57] jleyba: try changing the beginning of core.events.getEventFactory_ to
[21:43:23] jleyba: for (var key in bot.events.EventType) { if (key.toString() == eventName) {  return bot.events.EventType[key];  }}
[21:45:43] jimevans: key.toString()? how will that change the behavior? i don't see it.
[21:46:45] jimevans: when i console.log'd a for (var x in bot.events.EventType), i got a list of minified property names.
[21:47:27] jimevans: oh! but i could use "if key.type_ == eventName". that'd do it.

[23:36:49] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: in nyc, buses have ramps that let people on wheelchairs and electric scooters mount
[23:37:09] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: so do the ones in London
[23:37:09] Dude-X: and people have to give up their seats so that it can fold back so that the scooter or wheelchair can park
[23:37:25] Dude-X: what place does that article mention( in your tweet)
[23:37:53] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: 2nd paragraph
[23:37:56] AutomatedTester: Getting on a bus with a wheelchair involves the driver lowering a ramp that's situated at the rear door. Bus drivers are issued with a red book, their "bible" of instruction, which provides guidance for allowing wheelchair users to travel.

[23:42:33] Dude-X: i skimmed through the article, but the author does say that people complain that they don't care about his rights and bus drivers are less than cooperative
