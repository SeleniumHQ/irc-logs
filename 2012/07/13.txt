[00:05:01] stephenjudkins: so in Firefox, javascript errors don't include the name or message, only file and line.
[00:05:08] stephenjudkins: further, the Ruby library discards even those
[00:06:20] stephenjudkins: is this a known issue?

[00:14:38] Dude-X: ok; then i don't know
[00:14:58] Dude-X: javascript errors in the browser itself?
[00:15:03] Dude-X: in the web app
[00:15:10] stephenjudkins: Dude-X: JS called with execute_script
[00:15:34] stephenjudkins: the Firefox driver only appears to send file and line number back over the wire; the Ruby library throws away even those
[00:15:52] stephenjudkins: leaving us with the helpful: "JavascriptError: unknown"
[00:16:47] stephenjudkins: i wrote a little JS wrapper to try/catch and pass back all the info. but it seems strange that Selenium itself doesn't bother.
[00:17:10] Dude-X: oh i see; actually i do get useful error messages if i screw up a comand
[00:17:56] Dude-X: but other than that, i'd get an obscure error message say if I close the browser while it's waiting for a value in the DOm to be an equal value

[13:40:18] d0x: Hi, i got an webElement and i like to select the first parent of it that has a cssValue backgroundColor specified
[13:41:34] d0x: smth. like /preceding-sibling::*[@background-color is not blank]
[13:41:53] ipmb has joined #selenium
[13:42:45] RossPatterson: "/preceding-sibling::*[@background-color]" should do the job., or perhaps "/preceding-sibling::*[not(@background-color='')]"
[13:43:14] ipmb: I've got a set of Selenium tests that run clean on OS X and an Ubuntu desktop. When I run them on a headless Ubuntu machine with xvfb, however, a handful of tests fail.
[13:43:55] ipmb: I noticed the ones that fail are ones where I'm firing up multiple Firefox webdriver instances. It looks like send_keys is failing in one of the instances
[13:44:25] ipmb: (perhaps sending them to the other webdriver instance?)
[13:44:40] d0x: RossPatterson: But this XPath will not look for CSS specifed background colors like webElement.getCssAttribute(...) does
[13:45:25] ignacio__ has joined #selenium

[13:47:46] d0x: CSS Selctors are not supported by selenium, or_
[13:48:10] adamgoucher has joined #selenium
[13:48:24] RossPatterson: If you want CSS selectors, yes, WebDriver supports them (e.g., findElement(By.Css(...)))

[14:02:20] DaveIngram: Am I understanding correctly that any of the PHP Webdriver libraries need to be used in conjunction with a testing framework such as PHPUnit? i.e., Webdriver just controls the browser, it doesn't do testing, right?
[14:02:32] AutomatedTester: DaveIngram: correct
[14:03:22] DaveIngram: AutomatedTester: OK, thanks. The fog is slowly lifting on all of this. Any opinion on which PHP Webdriver library to use?
[14:03:53] AutomatedTester: DaveIngram: have a look at adamgoucher's saunter.php
[14:04:16] AutomatedTester: its a fork of the facebook one without you needing to undertand the internals of webdriver
[14:04:21] adamgoucher: or more specifically http://element34.ca/products/saunter/saunterphp
[14:04:48] adamgoucher: but saunter is /way/ more than just the forked bindings
[14:05:13] adamgoucher: 'just' the driver is at https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver
[14:06:12] DaveIngram: Awesome, thanks for the advice
[14:06:15] jimevans: Parabola: so for the IE driver, we look for windows with a window class of "#32770" or "Internet Explorer_TridentDlgFrame", without the WS_DISABLED bit and with the WS_VISIBLE bit set for the window style, and that has a process id equal to the process id of the iexplore.exe process we're running.
[14:06:39] AutomatedTester: argg.
[14:06:41] jimevans: that's a "dialog" as far as the IE driver is concerned.
[14:06:46] AutomatedTester: so much for a "quick win"
[14:06:49] hourback has joined #selenium
[14:07:25] d0x: can someone translate me this statement as css? /ancestor::*[not(@background-color='')]
[14:07:34] jimevans: the relevant code is in BrowserFactory::FindDialogWindowForProcess (BrowserFactory.cpp, line 354)
[14:07:36] d0x: i don't know how to do this ancestor in css
[14:07:43] adamgoucher: jimevans heh. i read those words and they just sound like the teacher on peanuts
[14:07:52] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: so what's the relationship between Saunter and Page Objects? …are page objects just a part of saunter?
[14:08:14] Parabola: jimevans: gotcha
[14:08:23] adamgoucher: DaveIngram: page objects is just a handwavey design pattern. that saunter tries /really/ hard to force you to use
[14:08:29] jimevans: adamgoucher: i only answer the question as asked. :)
[14:08:49] adamgoucher: jimevans: and it was an excellent answer :)
[14:09:22] RossPatterson: dOx: CSS can't do ancestor axes.
[14:11:20] eranm: jimevans, qq: Is there a command line argument to turn on logging for the IE driver?
[14:11:27] eranm: (when running ./go test_ie)
[14:14:53] jimevans: eranm: not from the build script, no. there are command-line args for logging in the IE driver server, which are documented in the wiki page
[14:15:40] jimevans: the java bindings may be able to set them with a system property, though, which i think can be set at the command line of the build script.
[14:16:41] eranm: jimevans, thanks
[14:17:01] eranm: For some reason the IE tests (of a clean check-out) crash the JVM on my Windows XP VM

[14:21:55] ipmb: do you guys know if there's any situations where it isn't safe to run 2 firefox webdrivers on the same box?
[14:22:15] AutomatedTester: ipmb: nope
[14:22:40] ipmb: on one of my test boxes (running under xvfb) send_keys doesn't appear to be doing anything
[14:23:03] ipmb: same site, same tests on a mac or ubuntu desktop pass with flying colors
[14:23:31] AutomatedTester: ipmb: whats it like without xvfb
[14:23:56] simonstewart: ipmb: it's almost always safe to run two firefox sessions
[14:24:03] ipmb: almost? :)
[14:24:13] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: why you hate window?
[14:24:26] simonstewart: ipmb: I can imagine instances where more than one might cause grief
[14:24:26] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: its so ambiguous
[14:24:36] simonstewart: (a particularly low-powered test machine)
[14:24:37] ipmb: I fire up two firefox instances, each one logs into a site
[14:24:41] simonstewart: (bad weather)
[14:24:43] simonstewart: (bad luck)
[14:24:56] simonstewart: ipmb: They should be independent of each other
[14:25:04] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: ah. yes. that
[14:25:17] ipmb: when I try it on this particular box, one of the instances doesn't get the credentials entered
[14:25:35] ipmb: when I look at a screenshot of the failed test, I can see the form was submitted, but the fields are empty
[14:26:07] simonstewart: I've seen things like that before
[14:26:15] ipmb: consistently when I'm running on this one machine (running Jenkins)
[14:26:17] simonstewart: Turned out to be a problem with the app under test
[14:26:48] ipmb: hmm, interesting
[14:27:16] simonstewart: They had a timer that built a model from the fields in a form every 0.25 seconds
[14:27:29] simonstewart: When you hit "submit" the last valid model's values were inserted into the form
[14:27:34] simonstewart: and the submit proceeded
[14:27:42] simonstewart: If you filled out the form in under a quarter of a second
[14:27:45] simonstewart: there was no valid model
[14:27:52] AutomatedTester: fml...
[14:27:57] ipmb: weird
[14:28:00] simonstewart: So the form was blanked out and everything got upset
[14:28:14] simonstewart: I had a long conversation with the devs explaining why that's not a smart thing to do
[14:28:15] ipmb: nothing crazy like that here
[14:28:20] AutomatedTester: protip, rebuild the section of firefox after changing it
[14:29:10] ipmb: simonstewart: if it was a problem in the app, you would expect it to fail everywhere you run the tests, right?
[14:29:38] ipmb: I'll run some more tests to see if I can narrow it down...

[16:04:19] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: window.flags = { 'category': ''}
[16:04:31] adamgoucher: ooo. thats even better
[16:04:50] AutomatedTester: adamgoucher: and then you can do window.flag.category

[18:09:47] barancev: (re: your discussion with eranm)
[18:09:57] barancev: I've documented this in the wiki
[18:12:57] simonstewart: barancev: "log=true" would make more sense
[18:13:09] simonstewart: Since, you know, that talks about logging already
[18:13:25] simonstewart: The selenium-backed tests keep an eye out for "webdriver.debug" too

[18:14:51] stockton has joined #selenium
[18:14:58] barancev: simonstewart: do you mean -Dlog=true? or just log=true?
[18:15:40] barancev: i was thinking about extending devMode option, e.g. to run FF with Firebug etc
[18:15:54] simonstewart: ./go some_target log=true
[18:16:13] simonstewart: Firefox will use firebug if you specify "debug=true"
[18:16:16] simonstewart: I think
[18:16:18] simonstewart: from memory
[18:16:47] barancev: ok, I'll change the option from devMode to log
[18:17:13] simonstewart: devmode was always meant to allow us to do "magic" if we were running tests in the IDE
[18:17:21] simonstewart: Specifically moving files into the classpath
[18:17:24] simonstewart: of the ide
[18:17:42] barancev: ok. I see
