[00:12:31] LUEshi: hello I need some selenium help
[00:13:35] LUEshi: http://hpaste.org/71297
[00:14:20] LUEshi: im trying to click on a button, the first it gives me an error the first time but the second time its fine
[00:15:02] Dude-X: that's weird. don't know ruby to see why you get that error
[00:15:23] LUEshi: the ruby people told me to come here
[00:20:54] Dude-X: our resident ruby maintainer seems to be away
[00:21:09] Dude-X: maybe can i see your test code?
[00:21:20] Dude-X: b.button looks kind of weird to me
[00:27:01] LUEshi: oh yeah sure
[00:27:17] LUEshi: why is b.button weird?
[00:28:02] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[00:28:02] Dude-X: i don't know ruby, but it looks you're operating on a webElement object
[00:28:28] Dude-X: also b is a terrible variable name
[00:28:38] LUEshi: lol ok
[00:28:42] LUEshi: its my first script thing
[00:29:27] LUEshi: http://hpaste.org/71300
[00:31:00] LUEshi: hmm yeah that wasnt so smart
[00:31:30] LUEshi: but can you help me out?
[00:31:42] slex: looks like js error in http://static.endoftheinter.net/base.js is occured
[00:32:00] LUEshi: yeah but if I do it twice it works
[00:32:11] LUEshi: the first time it spits out an error and the second time it works
[00:32:29] Dude-X: line 10 says :type the others say :name
[00:32:37] slex: can't convert b to primitive type is js error about b varible which is used in base.js
[00:33:09] LUEshi: hmm k I guess I cant help it then
[00:33:26] LUEshi: is there a way I can make my script continue to run even if it hits an error?
[00:33:32] ner0x has joined #selenium
[00:33:41] Dude-X: rescueâ€¦..
[00:33:46] Dude-X: can you run watir in the interpreter?
[00:33:51] Dude-X: you can experiment that way
[00:33:57] Dude-X: i do that in python
[00:34:00] LUEshi: how does this work?
[00:34:27] Dude-X: python example is:
[00:34:37] slex: in ruby it is irb, if i'm not wrong
[00:34:42] LUEshi: yeah
[00:34:45] LUEshi: thats what I use to test it
[00:34:51] Dude-X: driver = webdriver.Firefox(); it opens firefox, and then you can just navigate to what you want to test
[00:35:01] LUEshi: yeah thats how I built my script
[00:35:06] Dude-X: then type d.find_element_by_name('blah').send_keys('etc')
[00:35:07] LUEshi: but then I get to some form
[00:35:14] LUEshi: ok
[00:35:15] LUEshi: d.find
[00:37:14] LUEshi: it hits an error
[00:37:25] slex: also replace "sleep rand(3)" by "sleep 20 + rand(3)". maybe it is timing issue.
[00:37:38] LUEshi: it hits an erro before that
[00:37:47] LUEshi: at the place where there is 2 b.button
[00:37:58] LUEshi: the first is an error, the second goes fine
[00:40:26] Dude-X: well
[00:40:50] Dude-X: it can be several things
[00:40:59] Dude-X: typing something into that field transforms the element
[00:41:03] Dude-X: but the error message is not instructive
[00:41:07] Dude-X: since it's watir and not webdriver
[00:41:34] LUEshi: find element_by_name is an undefine method
[00:41:57] LUEshi: for watir
[00:43:24] Dude-X: i know that watir does things a bit differntly
[00:43:33] LUEshi: hold on
[00:43:35] Dude-X: also there's watir, and watirwebdriver, which are different
[00:43:52] Dude-X: or maybe it's using webdriver all along 
[00:43:55] Dude-X: i forge the story
[00:45:13] slex: for checking is it js error try run FF manually and repeat actions. do you have any errors in javascript console of browser or not?
[00:45:39] LUEshi: yeah I think
[00:46:19] LUEshi: oh no theres none

[00:58:01] slex: at which line of http://hpaste.org/71300 error is happened? at 10 ?
[00:59:07] dogarrhea2 has joined #selenium
[00:59:14] dogarrhea2: so.
[00:59:19] dogarrhea2: how do you detect visual bugs?
[00:59:43] dogarrhea2: say, a few pixels of one div is getting clipped and you can't see the text
[00:59:51] dogarrhea2: or is this not what selenium does?
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Jul 12 01:00:28 2012]
[01:00:28] dogarrhea2: to fully automate this kind of test, i'd think you need Image recognition
[01:01:18] stephenjudkins: dogarrhea2: (1) your name is gross. (2) in an image editor app we used getScreenshotAs, cropped to the dimensions of the editor field, and compared pixel-by-pixel (3) it was hard and maybe not worth it
[01:01:54] dogarrhea2: ok so it confirms that you cannot make sure that visual presentation is proper with just selenium
[01:02:14] stephenjudkins: well... it's not a computer vision library
[01:02:15] dogarrhea2: i actually have some image recognition framework built for this purpose, but it's for hacking poker bots
[01:02:36] LUEshi: lool
[01:02:40] dogarrhea2: selenium only cares about functionality of user interaction
[01:02:55] stephenjudkins: you can use window.getComputedStyle
[01:03:11] stephenjudkins: that is sometimes sufficient to make the assertions you want
[01:03:46] dogarrhea2: but most of the time it doesn't give you what a manual tester is seeing
[01:03:56] stephenjudkins: i don't really understand what you want to do here
[01:04:02] dogarrhea2: at best, selenium just is a macro for the manual tester where he just watches things go by
[01:04:04] stephenjudkins: "Selenium, does my app look not fucked up?"
[01:04:12] hellome has joined #selenium
[01:04:16] stephenjudkins: for some definition of "not fucked up"
[01:04:30] Dude-X: yeah manual QA has to visually inspect things, but as far as functionality goes, it's great for that
[01:04:42] stephenjudkins: what is that definition? how does a computer know that something looks reasonable or not?
[01:05:05] dogarrhea2: just trying to establish the limits of selenium2
[01:05:23] dogarrhea2: Flash is way out of scope i bet too
[01:05:49] hellome: hello guys.. wanted to know how i can run my tests in parallel my tests with selenium 2 grid.. 
[01:06:01] dogarrhea2: "test this bejeweled two application's functionality with selenium2"
[01:06:18] dogarrhea2: i also have a bot for that
[01:06:33] dogarrhea2: matrix math is fun
[01:07:18] hellome: i have a Grid setup ... one hub and 3 nodes... i can run tests on different browsers in parallel at the same time.. but dont know how to run them on the same machine
[01:07:51] Dude-X: have your test framework dispatch 3 tests at once that create new instances of remote webdriver
[01:08:29] dogarrhea2: hrm. if you're using a javascript animation library, that's also out of scope for selenium testing right?
[01:08:44] dogarrhea2: say you click a red circle, it slides across the screen, you click it again, it slides back
[01:08:44] LUEshi: maybe i have the wrong ruby version
[01:09:14] dogarrhea2: maybe you can detect coordinates of it at the end, but it might still get clipped near the edge of the screen or have some other visual presentation errors
[01:10:01] dogarrhea2: i guess selenium is only for those shitty enterprise apps without all the effects and visual niceties 
[01:10:11] dogarrhea2: which is still a big market, don't get me wrong
[01:11:24] dogarrhea2: i guess selenium is a "workflow automater"
[01:11:30] LUEshi: dogarrhea2: can you help me out with a selenium problem?
[01:12:01] LUEshi: or mb its not selenium, http://hpaste.org/71297 heres my error
[01:13:30] dogarrhea2: you can't really automate many public facing stuff with selenium it seems.  captchas. flash. presentation errors. javascript animation all screw selenium up
[01:14:01] dogarrhea2: well, these things are probably out of scope anyways for an "enterprise" app
[01:14:29] dogarrhea2: except the css stuff which you need a manual tester to stare at the screen for
[01:14:40] dogarrhea2: alright i'm gonna write my report soon
[01:14:56] dogarrhea2: i'm not even consdiering android or cocoa apps 
[01:15:39] LUEshi: dogarrhea2: mind taking a lookie?
[01:15:57] dogarrhea2: i'm not sure what the error is
[01:16:09] LUEshi: ya i cant figure it out either
[01:16:20] Dude-X: dogarrhea2: if selenium can automate a captcha, then that captcha is worthless
[01:17:15] Dude-X: nevertheless, people have used OCR and selenium to automate captchas :D
[01:17:19] dogarrhea2: yea, hence why it's not good for public facing apps (enterprise doesn't have too many captchas to piss off the incompetent permanent employees)
[01:17:32] Dude-X: but to break them, not to test them
[01:17:40] Dude-X: yeah that's true
[01:18:23] dogarrhea2: imagine if a doctor had to fill out a captcha on his patient workflow to submit them
[01:18:35] dogarrhea2: they would be screaming "clinical risk clinical risk" 
[01:19:23] dogarrhea2: even though there is none. but doctors are fucking assholes who want their bmw 7 series deliverd to their home by a tricyclist juggling chainsaws at 2 am in the morning
[01:20:11] sixpindin: I'd be very interested to see where Captchas are in twenty years...It'll be trying to spot replicants in bladerunner.
[01:20:29] dogarrhea2: the penis captcha on Family guy haha
[01:20:53] dogarrhea2: "i just stuck it in and broke it" -quagmire
[01:24:10] LUEshi: is there a way I can make my script disregard an error and continue?
[01:24:48] LUEshi: because it hits a javascript error on the first time but the second time it goes fine, I would like it to keep running even if it encounters an error
[01:26:30] slex: use somethong like begin b.button(..).click rescue ... end

[10:44:35] andreastt: emmasoderberg: OperaDriver supports the ones you removed, possibly also the new IEDriverServer.
[10:45:25] andreastt: Planning on moving the opera.logging.level capability to using the logging JSON object.
[10:45:40] barancev|2: andreastt: IEDriverServer does not (atm)
[10:46:07] barancev|2: you have to use a command like option. but it should be reimplemented using capabilities, I think
[10:46:47] barancev: s/command like/command line/
[10:47:02] andreastt: k
[10:47:29] andreastt: But regardless: Consolidating on using the same capabilities objects for common stuff like logging would be a good idea.
[10:47:31] stephend_ has joined #selenium
[10:48:22] emmasoderberg: andreastt: ok, sorry, then I'll change them back and reconsider the levels for the firefox driver
[10:49:34] andreastt: I'm not sure what is best, to be honest.  It's possible that we by default want to allow all Java logging levels, and then have sensible conversion to supported levels somewhere.
[10:49:48] barancev: and IEDriverServer has the following levels: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL
[10:49:50] andreastt: We do that for the launcher runner executable.
[10:49:54] andreastt: Wonderful.

[13:43:44] jimevans: ah. i'm guessing IE isn't going to be as forgiving, but give it a shot. make sure your mouse cursor is within the boundaries of the IE window when you try it. that's the pathological case there.

[16:00:31] lukeis: i would assume so... statements become more fluent :)
[16:00:45] Gungy: im finding my webdriver scripts are unstable, so they run perfectly fine after maybe 3 attempts but then on 4th or 5th run for example, it will fail because it cant see an element on the page - i have used a wait() and thread.sleep but just ends up making all my code messy - is there a better solution to this?
[16:00:59] Dude-X: in #python, some people prefer operator.methodcaller instead of lambdas
[16:01:02] zac_sel: presence_of_element_located is a bit verbose but makes the point
[16:01:34] Dude-X: Gungy: read https://blog.mozilla.org/webqa/2012/07/12/how-to-webdriverwait/
[16:02:05] Dude-X: i have long running tests that mostly pass because i use waiting strategies
[16:02:13] Dude-X: i use good waiting strategies
[16:02:21] Dude-X: and i've reduecd the use of thread sleeps
[16:02:27] RossPatterson: Gungy: Dude-X is right - moving to WebDriver requires thinking much more about how you want than RC did.
[16:03:29] Dude-X: zac_sel: i don't like the name element_located but i have to differentiate between locators and WebElement objects
[16:03:50] *lukeis has no "sleeps" in any of my code explicitly written (webdriverwait does the sleeping)
[16:04:10] Dude-X: i have sleeps because i haven't fixed everything that i can
[16:04:27] Dude-X: too many tests â€¦.
[16:04:30] lukeis: thread.sleep doesn't pass code review around here ;)
[16:05:37] Dude-X: ouch
[16:05:52] Dude-X: well so far every new test i've written i've avoided using a thread sleep
[16:05:54] zac_sel: dude-X have you ever had issues with waiting for an element not to be present? because WDW catches the elementnotfoundexception you have to catch it before WDW does
[16:06:41] Dude-X: so in my test suite on the project i am on, it's rare for my wrapped call to wait for an element to 'disappear' fails
[16:06:50] Dude-X: unless there is something with the page itself

[16:08:40] Dude-X: zac_sel is that a comment about the staleness_of method in the python code?
[16:08:45] Dude-X: or in general?
[16:09:36] zac_sel: no just in general
[16:10:57] Dude-X: it's not too often i call our method to wait for something to disapper but so far it works well for spinner/loading gifs
[16:11:12] zac_sel: do you use implicit wait?
[16:11:50] Dude-X: no. i've always had bad experiences with implicit waits in java. but some of our devs use that for our load testing scripts in python
[16:14:09] Dude-X: but the last time i've dabbled with implcit wait was in 2011 with an older version of selenium, and using implicit waits with explicit waits = tests that took twice as long to complete
[16:14:12] Dude-X: and still flaked.
[16:15:43] zac_sel: yeah :)
[16:15:56] zac_sel: know what you're tlaking about :)
[16:17:06] Dude-X: i just asked a coworker about the load testing scripts and he said it worked fine

[16:21:22] DaveIngram: thanks :)
[16:23:32] DaveIngram: I've set up a CentOS server and installed java, firefox, have the selenium standalone server, and have set up a firefox profile and am using Xvfb for the display.. but every time I try to run tests, selenium hangs on "Launching Firefox…"
[16:24:11] Dude-X: are you loading a custom profile?
[16:24:14] DaveIngram: it doesn't give me any additional feedback, and have been googling this for hours with no luck

[16:29:54] DaveIngram: Also, I've tried running selenium as root and two other users and all hang at the same place
[16:30:33] RossPatterson: DaveIngram: This is using the Selenium RC API?
[16:32:21] DaveIngram: RossPatterson: I am running it from the command line as such: export DISPLAY=":99" && java -jar /opt/selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar -browserSessionReuse -htmlSuite *firefox http://siteurl.com /home/user/selenium-tests/testfile.htm /home/user/results/selenium.html -firefoxProfileTemplate /path/to/firefox/slflo9ff.default
[16:32:57] DaveIngram: (paths changed from my actual server setup)
[16:34:06] lukeis: ahhh selenese ;)
[16:34:06] RossPatterson: There's a common problem with Selenium automating Firefox on Linux systems.  Selenium wants the path to the actual Firefox binary, but on most Linux systems, "firefox" is a shell script.  You might want to check into that.
[16:34:31] DaveIngram: RossPatterson: Indeed, sorry, I forgot to mention that I've done that as well
[16:34:42] RossPatterson: lukeis: Worse than that (from your perspective): Selenese + the RC server :-)
[16:34:57] lukeis: *cringe*
[16:35:01] RossPatterson: Rats :-)
[16:35:39] RossPatterson: The problem manifests itself as a failure to launch Firefox, or (sometimes) a failure to detect that Firefox has launched.
[16:35:43] DaveIngram: RossPatterson: I sym linked /usr/bin/firefox-bin to the actual firefox binary… that got me a little further down the process, but still not fully functional
[16:35:44] RossPatterson: Also, what Firefox version?
[16:36:41] DaveIngram: 10.0.5
[16:36:53] lukeis: DaveIngram: any chance you want to upgrade your html tests (using the IDE exporter) to WebDriver :-D  (I think that should be possible...)
[16:36:54] DaveIngram: installed via yum install firefox
[16:37:53] DaveIngram: lukeis: I'll do anything to get this working… what would that involve?
[16:38:04] RossPatterson: I ask because Selenium force-feeds Firefox an extension that has a limit on the maximum release version it supports.  I don't know what the current maximum is, but 10 ought to be OK with any recent Selenium.
[16:38:38] DaveIngram: RossPatterson: OK
[16:38:47] lukeis: loading your html test files into the Selenium IDE (firefox extension) and then using it's Export feature to export into the language of your choice (java, c#, python, ruby)
[16:39:48] RossPatterson: What Selenium version?
[16:39:58] lukeis: his command line shows 2.24.1
[16:40:07] RossPatterson: DOH!
[16:40:07] DaveIngram: RossPatterson: right, 2.24.1
[16:40:48] RossPatterson: A quick check of the source says it supports up to 15.0.*, so you should be OK there.
[16:43:36] DaveIngram: OK

[17:29:57] pindonga: lukeis, tbh don't know, finding out about it, but the code has a big red comment saying 'dont use .clear'
[17:30:11] pindonga: lukeis, I'm on linux, ubuntu precise more specifically, but I'm using selenium out of pypi
[17:30:20] lukeis: ok
[17:30:21] pindonga: lukeis, and particularly, I'm in an lxc container
[17:31:08] lukeis: don't use clear :-/  that's troubling .... if you need to clear the field then a better way (without using clear) is to execute_script
[17:31:09] Dude-X: are you passing in a file path?
[17:31:16] lukeis: it's a text box
[17:31:19] lukeis: or should be...
[17:31:34] pindonga:  it's a textfield, yes
[17:31:36] lukeis: CTRL + a
[17:33:10] pindonga: lukeis, I'm changing it to clear to see if it fixes the issue
[17:33:35] lukeis: it'll fix that issue for sure... whether or not it clears the field is another thing ;)
[17:33:39] pindonga: and will contact whoever wrote that to see why not using clear  is preferred
[17:33:43] pindonga: right
[17:33:44] pindonga: :)
[17:34:05] pindonga: lukeis, is send_keys(Keys().CONTROL, 'a') the right way to send ctrl-a?

[17:35:30] lukeis: yes
[17:35:55] pindonga: k, one reason for not using clear is that we want to really simulate the user
[17:36:03] pindonga: and the user will not do clear, but ctrl-a then delete
[17:36:52] lukeis: there's not a chance your webapp can tell the difference... clear sends the corresponding events to the text field too

[17:51:23] Dude-X: lukeis: we have a class called ellipsis, would get text return only the inner html or what's displayed on screen?

[17:51:53] Dude-X: the inner text might say "super long string text to read" but the display will say "super long stringâ€¦"
[17:51:59] h02_: is there any way to automate and handle the results of saucelabs tests made with the suacelab html builder.. ie every 30 minutes run this selenium test on saucelabs and if it fails send a message. surely i am not the only one who ever has wanted to do this? i have looked into  the jenkins plugin and that does not fit the bill...
[17:52:44] lukeis: Dude-X: I'm not sure... should return the ellipsis, but I don't know if that works :) (could be a Se bug!)
[17:53:09] Dude-X: i'll guess we'll find out
[17:53:16] Dude-X: i never thought about it until now 
[17:53:26] lukeis: h02_: I would use jenkins and set the job to build/run every 30 min
[17:54:20] jimevans: h02_: that'd be my advice too. jenkins just lives for that sort of thing.
[17:54:27] nhirata_ has joined #selenium
[17:54:56] h02_: jenkins does not.. i would still have to custom make my own setup to run some java thing to access saucelabs or whatever
[17:55:12] Dude-X: lukeis: i found one instance where we do an assertEquals() on text that returns an ellipsis
[17:55:19] Dude-X: seems like selenium works well then :D
[17:55:25] h02_: i mean something that lets you run the tests that the saucebuilder gives you
[17:55:41] lukeis: sounds like a sauce support question :)

[17:56:37] h02_: oh well time to make my own

[20:20:09] *DaveIngram sighs
[20:21:22] DaveIngram: lukeis: OK… so is that something I can use? Or do I need a different export or different language?
[20:21:44] DaveIngram: lukeis: I liked the idea of phpunit because it looks easy enough to integrate into our workflow
[20:24:42] lukeis: you should be able to do PHP... but means you'll need to code / port it to a WebDriver one... of any of the most worst choices you could make in selenium it would be RC+PHP
[20:27:05] *DaveIngram sighs again
[20:27:20] DaveIngram: lukeis: OK… so back to the drawing board…
[20:28:14] DaveIngram: What I'm *trying* to do, is set up an environment where developer can use Selenium IDE to write simple tests and then easily export them into *something* which can then be run on my testing server during the build process
[20:29:00] DaveIngram: If I can't do advanced stuff with the IDE, that's fine. I just need to be able to do the basic test coverage with straight forward form submission and text assertions for now.
[20:29:28] lukeis: you're going to get yourself in a very unmaintainable state if you do that
[20:29:56] lukeis: you should just bite the bullet and do this: https://github.com/Element-34/saunter.php
[20:30:19] lukeis: which i believe means you need this installed too https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver
[20:30:40] lukeis: page object pattern is a really maintainable way forward
[20:30:47] opapo has joined #selenium
[20:30:55] lukeis: if your dev's know php it shouldn't be too difficult to put together
[20:31:24] lukeis: the first test(s) setup will be the most painful... after that it does get easier
[20:32:10] lukeis: front-load your pain... vs. pain later is my recommendation. (IDE and the way you were describing may be 'easy' now... but will be very painful later)
[20:32:27] DaveIngram: lukeis: would you mind elaborating on why using the IDE will be so painful?
[20:32:58] Dude-X: my what a dumb mistake. I have a click function that dosen't click(). oops
[20:33:23] lukeis: it generates fragile locators and your tests become brittle. You will likely have many tests to update whenever a page changes it's layout (or even identifiers)
[20:39:33] DaveIngram: lukeis: I see.
[20:40:23] lukeis: if you stick with a page object pattern, anytime a page changes you only need to change it in the page object (so one place ~ or at least very few depending on the change)
[20:41:44] lukeis: you can do that pattern with RC... but the RC bindings with PHP old and unmaintained and RC itself isn't getting any love
[20:43:34] dmachi has joined #selenium
[20:44:58] DaveIngram: lukeis: just so I'm clear, RC is what Selenium 1 was all about, right? and WebDriver is the way forward because it simulates a real user in a browser and is more powerful, right?
[20:45:51] AutomatedTester: DaveIngram: exactly
[20:46:33] lukeis: plus webdriver is becoming a W3C spec ;)
[20:46:47] AutomatedTester: exactly
[20:47:12] lukeis: extra bonus points for AutomatedTester :)
[20:47:13] DaveIngram: OK. So I'm sold on web driver, but does that really rule out using IDE as a viable solution for at least some of our tests?
[20:47:30] Chuckleteeth_ has joined #selenium
[20:47:31] lukeis: as long as you want to export to PHP it does...
[20:47:48] stephenjudkins: in Firefox, pressing the "backspace" key trigger ONLY a "keydown" event, no "keypress". in webdriver, sendKeysToElement triggers both a "keydown" and a "keypress"
[20:47:53] stephenjudkins: this can be considered a bug, right?
[20:48:04] DaveIngram: lukeis: What language does IDE work best with?
[20:48:15] lukeis: none ;)
[20:48:28] lukeis: but it exports to Java, C#, Python, Ruby

[20:49:54] AutomatedTester: stephenjudkins: that should be fine too
[20:50:01] lukeis: well, most won't have the setup to run it... but should be fine
[20:50:15] AutomatedTester: stephenjudkins: as long as I can run it then I will fix it
[20:50:21] stephenjudkins: AutomatedTester: yeah I just gave up on putting in that bug report last time because I didn't have the energy to convert

[21:17:17] diminoten: above linked error happens during a driver.close() and renders the node unresponsive until restarted
[21:18:36] AutomatedTester: diminoten: ooo I saw a bug like that earlier
[21:19:18] diminoten: it's happening consistently with only two of my tests, maybe I can isolate it

[21:31:33] *AutomatedTester must have been under a rock to miss that story
[21:31:35] diminoten: hm perhaps not
[21:31:47] *AutomatedTester only found out about them today
[21:33:10] lukeis: wow, that's interesting... but doesn't sound out of character for london :)
[21:34:12] AutomatedTester: in the last 2 days I have seen 2 articles that make me extremely glad to live away from London
[21:34:24] AutomatedTester: but I will be visiting dawagner soon
[21:35:20] diminoten: yeah this is different, the logs give something discriptive here
[21:38:24] lukeis: eh... i grew up 'away' from Los Angeles... but had a NIKE silo not far from me, i *think* it was decommisioned when I was growing up though
[21:39:11] AutomatedTester: lukeis: these are temporary ones for the olympics
[21:39:18] AutomatedTester: to "deter" terrorists
[21:39:20] lukeis: yeah, i get it :)
[21:39:34] lukeis: aka, blow them the f* up
[21:39:54] dawagner: That's one interpretation.  Or, you know, fucking up London, that's another :)
[21:40:46] *kallisti has gotten much more familiar with xpath in the past few days.
[21:40:59] lukeis: well, that's what'll happen when they blow one up... the shrapnel has to go somewhere
[21:41:06] lukeis: kallisti: for shame...
[21:41:14] kallisti: it's not so bad.
[21:41:17] AutomatedTester: the thing that gets me, is if a surface-to-air missile is fired and hits something, the debris will kill people too
[21:41:24] AutomatedTester: shrapnel is a killer
[21:42:03] *AutomatedTester is a hippy apparently, wtf do I know
[21:42:25] lukeis: in some way it's a win-win for the terrorist... fly a plane they plan to die in into london and get blown up and take out something anyways...

[22:09:17] Zack: might be a dumb question but.. is there an easy way for a programming illiterate QA manager to run tests I've created via IntelliJ? 
[22:09:37] AutomatedTester: Zack: via ant or maven
[22:09:53] AutomatedTester: then its just a command on the command line
[22:10:21] Dude-X: create an ant target

[22:13:21] sixpindin: Hey all, does anybody know how to configure proxy settings on the HTMLunit driver?
[22:13:26] lukeis: <gripe>managers of coders need to know how to program as apart of their job description and sometimes actually code when needed</gripe>
[22:13:55] AutomatedTester: lukeis: couldnt agree more
[22:14:08] Zack: :p
[22:14:31] AutomatedTester: my manager's manager still does a little engineering
[22:14:37] AutomatedTester: and he is pretty much a VP
[22:14:58] sixpindin: + agree with lukeis on the manager thing. It's a difficult problem to solve though as most managers are up to thier eye-balls in ...managing people, and even if they did know how to code, how could they find the time to maintain it?
[22:16:06] AutomatedTester: sixpindin: they can delegate but when there is a fan and shit and its hitting it then need to drop the pointy-hairness and code
[22:16:13] lukeis: it's the coders job to maintain the code, usually they just need to know how and when everyone is pinned to the wall on a release and over committed, they need to chip in
[22:16:19] AutomatedTester: get down in the trenches
[22:16:28] Zack: yea I don't see our manager doing that
[22:16:29] Zack: haha
[22:16:49] Zack: she doesn't even have a local environment setup at her station.  Just access to the qa env
[22:16:57] lukeis: my managers haven't recently when the coders have been working around 60hrs/week... not ok in my eye
[22:17:02] AutomatedTester: Zack: does she manager more than QA?
[22:17:55] Zack: AutomatedTester: not really, mostly just handles the ticketing system on jira and checking the commits 
[22:18:22] AutomatedTester: Zack: oh so she is a support person who happens to manage people who code?
[22:18:44] *AutomatedTester shouldnt be nasty, sorry
[22:19:00] *AutomatedTester has been lucky with managers
[22:19:44] Zack: haha well it's tough because our other managers are very technically proficient.  our chief architect does almost everything in a programming standpoint.  
[22:19:45] lukeis: sixpindin: back to your original quesetion, have you looked at HtmlUnitDriver.setProxy?
[22:19:46] diminoten: wheeeeew

[22:20:20] andreastt: s/wya/way
[22:20:21] Zack: there were no automated tests before I was hired.. let's put it that way
[22:20:23] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I am, sort of.
[22:20:34] sixpindin: AutomatedTester: perhaps, but imagine you have a ship and it gets into a storm, and there are people manning the sails and a captain keeping the ship pointing roughly the right direction; the captain can't leave his post to man the sails. Perhaps more coders are required? - Also, that could be a terrible analogy too..

[22:21:08] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I am seeing your issue of windows
[22:21:08] Zack: sixpindin: that makes sense. I agree with that
[22:21:55] AutomatedTester: sixpindin: if you use that analogy then if the ship sinks the coders should be safe and the captain gets the sack
[22:22:08] AutomatedTester: because captains are the last off the ship
[22:22:10] Zack: ^^
[22:22:10] andreastt: AutomatedTester: My issue, can you provide more context?
[22:22:22] AutomatedTester: andreastt: "what is a window" 
[22:22:26] lukeis: sixpindin: except usually there's a business person steering the product and the manager is analogous to the guy beating the drum.
[22:22:29] AutomatedTester: its very ambiguous
[22:22:34] andreastt: Aha, yes.  Indeed.
[22:23:04] *AutomatedTester is going to implement a number of methods and then fix the issues that come from that
[22:23:19] andreastt: In some of our products, we even have the JS, security and modal dialogues as HTML/CSS/DOM windows, complicating it further.
[22:23:20] *AutomatedTester can see there will be unhappy people somewhere
[22:23:29] andreastt: Actually, even the right-click context menu is HTML someitmes.
[22:24:00] AutomatedTester: andreastt: we have browser chrome and tab windows
[22:24:15] AutomatedTester: so when I call close() what do I close?
[22:24:21] AutomatedTester: the tab? the window?
[22:24:27] andreastt: (Which is fun when you accidentally shift focus to the context menu and run all consequtive tests inside that runtime.  Sigh.)
[22:24:58] *AutomatedTester is implementing like WebDriver 
[22:25:07] AutomatedTester: and then will update accordingly
[22:25:14] sixpindin: Totally, I mean it's so complicated and every situation is differnet, there is no one way to go. I totally agree that managers should be 'able' to code, just so theyh have a good understanding of what it is they are commanding, like the captain of a ship should be 'able' to man the sails but it just feels like if there's a situation where the manager is required to code then perhaps it's a resource issue. However, I agree that there may be s
[22:25:25] sixpindin: sorry for the long messages....
[22:25:36] andreastt: AutomatedTester: Yes, I find close() a bit ambigious too.
[22:26:02] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I sort of disagree that it should quit the browser session if the last window is closed, becuase that behaviour is highly OS dependent.
[22:26:24] Zack: in my particular situation I am a system admin/QA engineer.  And I am the only QA engineer.  The QA manager used to just do manual testing
[22:26:24] jfunk has joined #selenium
[22:26:25] andreastt: But I guess it's a natural consequence of not having API's for spawning new windows.
[22:26:33] andreastt: And the fact that we likely won't have that in the near future.
[22:27:59] andreastt: sixpindin: I think it's fundamental that your manager has an understanding of what you're telling her too.
[22:28:15] andreastt: Superficial understand doesn't cut it in my experience.
[22:28:18] andreastt: +ing
[22:28:27] AutomatedTester: andreastt: and they need to understand what they are asking you to do too
[22:28:41] AutomatedTester: in case the need to run interference 
[22:29:15] andreastt: sixpindin: If both â€œspeak the same languageâ€, communication is less hard.  But obviously, communication is hard regarldess.
[22:29:51] jarib has joined #selenium
[22:30:39] sixpindin: That said (About managers understanding things) - I still agree, but there;s a thought in the back of my head...if we compared business to application developments, then could we say that there's a certain 'separation of concerns' that comes with each abstraction? - I mean, if programmers are closed and just 'do stuff' and the manager should not be concerned with how they do it? - it sounds strange, and I kina dissagree, but I'm just saying,
[22:31:24] Zack: andreastt: but isn't that a business analyst not a QA Manager?
[22:32:18] sixpindin: andreastt: I agree on the communication thing. 
[22:32:23] andreastt: I guess it depends on the role of your manager.  Some companies are bigger than others.
[22:32:51] Zack: Yea that's true
[22:34:10] Dude-X: what's needed for 2.25 to be pushed?

[22:34:57] Dude-X: mmm, bacon
[22:35:09] andreastt: Does anyone have hands-on experience with renaming entire package namespaces of hundreds of classes in Java?
[22:35:38] AutomatedTester: andreastt: not me
[22:35:39] diminoten: renaming?  IDE!
[22:35:50] AutomatedTester: but it sounds "fun"
[22:36:09] diminoten: load your package into something like eclipse or intellij
[22:36:20] Dude-X: i think eclipse can handle that
[22:36:21] andreastt: I mean, I know how to technically do it; I'm more worried about the long-term impliciations in dependencies relying on the library.
[22:36:31] Dude-X: oh.
[22:36:32] diminoten: oh 
[22:36:37] diminoten: a philosophical question
[22:36:52] andreastt: I guess I could give some context.
[22:36:52] Dude-X: i see a few builds are yellow, so i guess there's a few more fixes before 2.25 can go
[22:37:07] andreastt: The namespace for the OperaDriver currently says com.opera.core.systems.*.
[22:37:33] andreastt: Seeing as other parts of Opera are implementing new drivers, it would make sense to move it to com.opera.*, but I'm scared of doing it in a point/patch release.
[22:37:52] diminoten: well if you follow semver and increment the major version number, that denotes your newest releases will not be backwards compatible, which leaves you free to move packages to wherever you want
[22:37:56] andreastt: It _might_ make sense to do it in the 1.0 release.
[22:38:06] diminoten: I recommend waiting until 1.0
[22:38:25] diminoten: people expect stuff like that in major versions
[22:38:46] *andreastt nods
[22:38:53] andreastt: I guess that would make sense.
