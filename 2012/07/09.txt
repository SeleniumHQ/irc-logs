[10:28:12] DocD2: morning
[10:28:44] naeg has joined #selenium
[10:30:59] DocD2: automatedTester I should be looking in /javasctip/atoms/frame.js for the state stuff?
[10:33:03] AutomatedTester: DocD2: what is going stale?
[10:33:25] AutomatedTester: DocD2: have you reproduced with the API directly instead of your DSL?
[10:34:00] DocD2: the iframe
[10:34:04] DocD2: or frame
[10:34:52] AutomatedTester: DocD2: I would reproduce the issue with just using the webdriver API first before digging into our code base
[10:43:37] DocD2: ok quick question then
[10:43:43] DocD2: If I find the frame
[10:43:49] DocD2: then find an element on that frame
[10:43:55] DocD2: should the frame be stale?
[10:44:46] simonstewart: The frame element won't be stale, but you wont' be able to find it if you've switched to the frame, so that's the exception you'll get
[10:46:16] DocD2: if its in the frame I should be able to find it?
[10:46:39] DocD2: I'll run a test
[10:46:59] simonstewart: So, you find a frame in the top level. You switch to that frame. Is the element representing the frame in the current context?
[10:47:11] DocD2: yes it finds it
[10:47:25] DocD2: but then any further requests gets stale response
[10:47:41] simonstewart: Which is basically what I'd expect. Let me demonstrate in code
[10:48:03] simonstewart: WebElement frame = driver.findElement(By.tagName("iframe")); 
[10:48:15] simonstewart: driver.switchTo().frame(frame);
[10:48:30] simonstewart: frame.getAttribute("foo");  // should now throw a stale element excpetion
[10:48:45] simonstewart: As the underlying DOM element is not in the current context
[10:49:04] DocD2: but if foo is on the frame it shouild work right?
[10:49:11] simonstewart: No.
[10:49:17] simonstewart: Because you've switched into another document
[10:49:27] simonstewart: that does not have the undlying frame element in it
[10:49:39] DocD2: oh right
[10:49:44] simonstewart: :)
[10:50:01] DocD2: I'm a little estracted from the selnium code
[10:50:07] simonstewart: NP
[10:50:08] DocD2: can I post some webdriver logs?
[10:50:16] DocD2: about 30 lines?
[10:51:03] simonstewart: :gist
[10:51:03] selbot2: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[10:51:34] DocD2: https://gist.github.com/3075505
[10:52:47] DocD2: thats what remote webdriver is reporting.  Everything works as CoyPu recovers I think it may be slowing thigns down
[10:52:56] DocD2: I'll do a test in selenium and see

[13:03:52] jarib: simonstewart: still have a git question?
[13:04:00] simonstewart: Not any more
[13:04:30] Paul_Eleven: Hi all.. Can I ask questions about configurin Selenium, Maven  and Jenkins here?
[13:04:40] simonstewart: yes
[13:04:56] Paul_Eleven: Okay.
[13:06:37] Paul_Eleven: We want to run Selenium systemtests in our Jenkins build but can't figure out how to run them correctly. We have a headless server which runs Jenkins and we want to run the systemtests after each build. But how do we configure it so it starts a server with the project running on it, since that is needed for the systemtests.
[13:06:53] Paul_Eleven: server is tomcat 7 by the way
[13:08:02] simonstewart: I just write a helper class to start the server in my tests
[13:08:22] simonstewart: And then use a @BeforeClass annotation on my test suite to ensure that it's actually started
[13:08:47] Paul_Eleven: okay. Do you run it on a headless server?
[13:08:51] samuelgiles: or you could use the build file (Ant or Maven) to start the server process?
[13:09:22] simonstewart: That works too
[13:09:32] simonstewart: Paul_Eleven: the headfulness of the server doesn't matter
[13:10:27] Paul_Eleven: Hmmz.. but to use firefox or any other browser you need something like X11 or so right?
[13:11:49] simonstewart: Paul_Eleven: Ah. To run a browser, yes
[13:11:53] simonstewart: To run a server, no
[13:11:56] simonstewart: I use Xvfb
[13:12:06] simonstewart: Or XVnc if I want to be able to connect and watch tests
[13:13:13] Paul_Eleven: simonstewart, I've read about that but have to dig into it. You still are able to use it for dynamic test but which I mean testing javascript functionality

[13:14:41] samuelgiles: Paul_Eleven: So what exactly is your setup?
[13:15:36] Paul_Eleven: samuelgiles, We have Jenkins running on a headless server which builds our projects.
[13:15:47] simonstewart: "headless server" == "linux"?
[13:16:01] simonstewart: If you're on Windows you're up the creek.
[13:16:28] Paul_Eleven: simonstewart, Ubunto 11.04 server
[13:17:51] samuelgiles: So what is "headless" about Ubuntu Server? What do you mean
[13:18:42] barancev: simonstewart: changelog should mention new IE logging abilities (instead of #4170 that is just a bug introduced while implementing this new feature)

[13:19:18] Paul_Eleven: samuelgiles, We have several virtual machine running. Of those machines one is the Jenkins build server.  All vm's don't have any display capacity, so they are headless
[13:21:17] simonstewart: barancev: feel free to add it
[13:21:28] simonstewart: Paul_Eleven: You really do need an X server of some sort running
[13:21:50] simonstewart: Please look at Xvfb: it'll solve a lot of your pain
[13:22:05] Paul_Eleven: but if I understand it correctly I need to figure out a way to start tomcat with the project deployed onto it and then play with xvfb to be able to run the tests
[13:22:17] Paul_Eleven: simonstewart, I understand. Thanks for your information!
[13:22:25] Paul_Eleven: samuelgiles, thanks to you also!
[13:24:19] samuelgiles: Starting TomCat with the project deployed to it is simple or is that the bit you're having trouble with? I'm not massively experienced with Tomcat but we build the project and then point an Apache VHOST to the directory it was built on.  We use this then as a CI build which everyone can access in the LAN
[13:24:58] samuelgiles: And then we can start up WebDriver/Selenium tests on our grid or Sauce Labs's grid
[13:26:55] Paul_Eleven: samuelgiles, that seems an interesting idea. Will take a look into it if it makes sense in our environment

[14:06:50] adamgoucher: krosenvold has a git repo for se, but its not the official place for things. google code is.
[14:10:02] simonstewart: Partly because Google is funding the development of Selenium with my team here

[14:28:05] barancev: adamgoucher: I've made some measurements that shown almost no difference betwenn xpath ans css for FF and Chrome
[14:28:59] barancev: in IE css is about 10-20% faster, not huge difference though
[14:29:32] adamgoucher: in ie9 and newer? i thought it grew xpath so we we dont use the js implementation [that se-rc was using]

[14:30:31] adamgoucher: samuelgiles: dunno if i have tried it
[14:31:10] barancev: the real big difference is between browsers: for a single xpath request Chrome is 3 times slower than FF, IE is 6-7 times slower that FF

[14:37:18] lukea: Also I am looking at using it with PHP, yet there seem to be 5 different drivers, none of which are officially supported (thinking about picking the one done by facebook)
[14:37:23] llaskin: no php driver.
[14:37:31] llaskin: the closest you will get is the one adamgoucher supports
[14:37:49] lukea: which one is that
[14:38:07] samuelgiles: lukea : https://github.com/Element-34/php-webdriver/
[14:39:06] llaskin: ok i need an answer to this one:  if someone asks you for an analysis of POST requests on a page...would you include GET requests in your response?
[14:39:11] lukea: llaskin, I am currently tasked with just researching continuous integration at the moment, and seeing what would be possible given our tight deadlines (every project we've ever done has over run, so I'm going to have fun selling it)
[14:39:21] lukea: samuelgiles, thanks
[14:39:44] lukea: samuelgiles, ah the facebook clone

[14:40:06] RossPatterson: llaskin: Not if I was being precise :-)
[14:40:18] lukea: the facebook one no good then?
[14:40:40] RossPatterson: lukea: CI usually leads to reduced overruns, but it can take a little effort to get there.
[14:40:41] llaskin: Ross which as a QA person ...i have to be right?

[14:41:11] llaskin: oh no
[14:41:13] llaskin: this is a developer

[15:25:21] Pukerat: I was thinking about your mouse issues in IE
[15:26:06] Pukerat: and if internet explorer truely behaves the way you suspect it does... perhaps try using that to inject something inbetween internet explorer and user32.dll
[15:26:33] Pukerat: then when internet explorer attempts to call GetCursorPos for whatever silly reason it pleases, you can fool it
[15:26:50] AutomatedTester: bbl
[15:27:24] Pukerat: fyi, its chuckleteeth
[15:27:31] Pukerat: i dont know why it picked pukerat
[15:27:46] jimevans: great idea. can't use it though, due to licensing issues ("research, non-commercial, and non-production use"). and it only works on 32-bit processes with the "express" version.
[15:28:02] samuelgiles: "research"
[15:28:04] samuelgiles: :P
[15:28:09] jimevans: i don't have an extra US$10K lying around for a "professional" license.
[15:28:21] Pukerat: selenium is considered commerical?
[15:28:29] Pukerat: its free software : (
[15:28:54] jimevans: it is, but you've just entered a dependency that would make it impossible for someone to create a commercial offering based on it.
[15:29:01] jimevans: s/entered/created/
[15:29:28] Pukerat: we have people from mozilla here, nobody hangs out in here from the microsoft camp?
[15:29:46] jimevans: engaging with MSFT isâ€¦ problematic.
[15:29:56] jimevans: particularly with the IE group
[15:30:04] Pukerat: Surely it would be in their own best interest to help us automate their god awful browser...
[15:30:17] Pukerat: or do we have to make webdriver a webstandard before they will listen to us
[15:30:30] samuelgiles: jimevans: out of interest what were your mouse problems in IE?

[16:02:24] Pukerat: so what is the likely outcome if this becomes a standard?
[16:04:31] jimevans: Pukerat: pie-in-the-sky outcome? each browser vendor implements the standard, and the selenium webdriver project is reduced to only language bindings and a test suite.
[16:05:16] samuelgiles: that'll be the day :P
[16:06:47] Pukerat: microsoft still doesn't follow standards tho
[16:07:02] clm has joined #selenium
[16:07:19] jimevans: Pukerat: my cynical, more realistic outcome? you see more-or-less what you see now. the "open" browser vendors (Google, Mozilla, Opera) implement the standard, and the "closed" vendors (Apple, Microsoft) ignore it. Apple will implement before MSFT does, imo.
[16:09:38] Pukerat: microsoft is such a silly place
[16:09:44] Zack: agreed.
[16:09:51] Pukerat: I know a co-worker that used to work for microsoft for like 7 years

[16:12:55] detronizator: jimevans: Patrick Lightbody today brought to my attention a thread about 2.25 in the ggroup
[16:13:04] detronizator: jimevans: the key thing - IE Server.exe
[16:13:08] samuelgiles: jimevans: typedef that represents a boolean value though right? hence the name "bool"

[16:14:50] detronizator: jimevans: so, from 2.25 it's the point where the legacy option is gone. Right?
[16:15:27] jimevans: detronizator: i don't think it's actually going to make it into 2.25. we were going to, but i think we've run out of time for that. probably 2.26.

[16:19:02] jimevans: i never actually worked on visual studio.
[16:19:04] jimevans: :)
[16:19:07] Pukerat: aww
[16:19:13] Pukerat: i really like visual studio now to be honest
[16:19:37] jimevans: i did a little work on VB. most of my time was spent working on microsoft access.
[16:19:49] Pukerat: well, i haven't tried the newest one yet, it looked retarded 
[16:19:59] jimevans: (which was in the developer tools division when it started its life)
[16:20:08] Pukerat: good lord access? 
[16:20:34] Swadq has joined #selenium
[16:20:36] jimevans: yep. 
[16:21:18] jimevans: a good product, when used correctly
[16:21:34] Pukerat: Im too young to have used it when it was in its prime
[16:22:26] lukea: adamgoucher, sorry for the stupid question... but does this relate in any way to your php-webdriver? http://www.phpunit.de/manual/3.6/en/selenium.html
[16:22:29] Zack: I'm too young to have ever even seen it in practical use. 
[16:22:40] jimevans: i had a hand in every version of it shipped up to 2003.
[16:22:48] adamgoucher: i managed all of a bank's y2k correspondence, assets, etc. in access back in the day
[16:23:12] jimevans: heh. i remember doing y2k testing for access.
[16:23:45] adamgoucher: lukea: nope. completely separate. phpunit has since grown a webdriver class (but i dont like some of the ideas they use in their rc and webdriver classes)
[16:24:26] lukea: adamgoucher, how do you use your php-webdriver? within your unit tests, or do you just keep your selenium tests separate?
[16:24:28] jimevans: at the time access 2.0 was still supported, so i had an excuse to install 16-bit windows 3.1. in 1999. on a ramdrive. 
[16:25:11] adamgoucher: lukea: well, i have http://element34.ca/products/saunter/saunterphp
[16:25:47] jimevans: right. i have a lunch appointment. back in a couple of hours.
[16:25:52] Pukerat: i once worked for an electronics manufacturer who still did parts inventory using dBase
[16:26:09] Pukerat: later'
[16:26:53] lukea: adamgoucher, ah, that looks promising... as the documentation says the PHPUnit Selenium stuff is incomplete?
[16:28:08] adamgoucher: lukea: dunno. i dont follow the state of the phpunit stuff (or any of the other bindings really)

[18:41:51] NeptuNooo: Webdriver is designed to throw an exception if an element is not found. Is there a method to just check if element exist on a page, without throwing exception if it doesn't exist ?
[18:42:22] adamgoucher: find_elements then see if the return array has something
[18:42:29] jleyba: driver.findElements(By.id("not-there")).isEmpty()
[18:42:32] jimevans: NeptuNooo: nope. standard practice is to either catch the exception, or use the findElements method
[18:42:50] jleyba: findElements is faster
[18:43:26] NeptuNooo: thank you :)
[18:43:27] barancev: why faster?
[18:43:30] emaugust has joined #selenium
[18:43:39] jimevans: because you don't have to catch the exception.
[18:43:45] jimevans: exception handling is a perf hit.
[18:43:51] jimevans: (in most languages)
[18:43:57] barancev: it depends on the amount of elements
[18:44:07] barancev: sometimes findElements is slower
[18:44:35] jleyba: if you're using an overly broad locator or XPath
[18:44:53] barancev: because it builds a list of object, and memory management is even slower than exception handling
[18:44:58] jleyba: If you're using XPath, slowness is a feature not a bug :)
[18:46:04] barancev: exception appears sometimes, whereas memory management is always here
[18:46:30] jleyba: if you're going through the java server you also have to factor in that annoying screenshot on error option
[18:46:53] barancev: that can be set off
[18:47:04] jleyba: right, but if you turn it on, findElements will always be faster
[18:47:22] barancev: and again -- list serialization is slower
[18:47:56] barancev: yes, if screenshots are on, fildElements is faster, no doubt
[18:48:26] barancev: but the real slowpoke is the browser and the webapp, anyway :)

[19:47:21] AutomatedTester: if your test is in PHP then no
[19:48:03] d3f4ultr0: oh ok

[19:48:34] d3f4ultr0: ok
[19:48:44] d3f4ultr0: i'm trying to figure out how to bring up selenium on my firefox
[19:48:50] AutomatedTester: lukeis: unfortunately they wont load a PHP file that is already developed
[19:48:56] lukeis: true ;)
[19:50:35] lukeis: d3f4ultr0: if you're trying to execute a php selenium script you first need the standalone server from the :downloads page and then run it with `java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar`  then you can execute the php script and it should communicate with that server which will start up the firefox browser for you

[20:50:41] Zack: I went from Selenium IDE to WebDriver/Java 3 weeks ago.  I just rewrote my scripts from the IDE to Java.  The export didn't work very well because I used IDE extensions for my JS in the test cases

[22:40:53] Zack: should be a + sign for adding
[22:41:24] emaugust: ahhhh

[22:42:27] emaugust: I think I will need to start fresh tomorrow
[22:42:40] emaugust: still a bit confused - creating a new configuration doesn't solve my compile errors
[22:43:22] Zack: your Java class path in your configuration may be off :/
[22:43:45] emaugust: ahh - I will look into that :] thanks for your help again Zack

[23:24:15] jimevans: dawagner: heh.
[23:25:48] jimevans: wow. building qtwebkit takes a loooooooooong time. remind me of this the next time i bitch about the atoms compile time.
[23:26:19] AutomatedTester: jimevans: building webkit is painful
[23:27:06] jimevans: ignorance is bliss. of course, if i'd known how bad it is, i wouldn't have done it. :)
[23:27:20] AutomatedTester: sometimes our code base makes my brain hurt when it is this late
[23:27:44] jimevans: who is "our"? mozilla or selenium?
[23:27:51] AutomatedTester: selenium
[23:28:09] jimevans: indeed.
[23:28:17] AutomatedTester: I am trying to look something up and port it to marionette
[23:28:58] AutomatedTester: but respond.session.getBrowser().contentTitle; and then seeing what Mozilla interfaces are being used is painful for tracking it back
[23:31:20] jimevans: btw, for us hackers of a certain age, "ready player one" is a pretty entertaining read.

[23:36:42] detronizator: jimevans: hey
[23:36:51] detronizator: jimevans: I just came back
[23:36:56] detronizator: jimevans: u still here?
[23:36:59] jimevans: no worries. just
[23:37:32] jimevans: just had a couple of phantomjs questions. i know you're not the owner, but you probably know more about the project than anyone in the channel
[23:37:47] jimevans: i wanted to get a windows build going.
[23:38:17] jimevans: i *think* i'm succeeding on the 1.6 branch. how often does ariya merge back to master?
[23:38:20] detronizator: jimevans: you just cought one of our "current" issues
[23:38:44] detronizator: jimevans: what you mean? he owns master
[23:38:56] detronizator: jimevans: u have a patch for master?
[23:38:56] ner0x has joined #selenium
[23:39:24] jimevans: no, don't misunderstand me. i'm just playing around with getting a build to work.\

[23:39:32] detronizator: ah ok
[23:39:33] detronizator: so
[23:39:44] detronizator: there is a german-italian: Alessandro Portale
[23:39:53] detronizator: he is our "windows build" expert and master
[23:40:08] jimevans: yeah, i've been sorta, kinda following the mailing list thread.
[23:40:17] detronizator: he is in charge, currently, of bringing back to master the changes needed to make it work in windows
[23:40:25] detronizator: as far as I can see, his stuff has not been merged yet
[23:40:41] jimevans: yeah, it looks like he got some bits merged into the 1.6 branch.
[23:40:53] detronizator: the current 1.6 build for windows comes from his own machine
[23:41:01] jimevans: that branch, at least, builds webkit. :)
[23:41:04] detronizator: he did?
[23:42:06] jimevans: if i'm reading the log right. "ariya committed 9 hours ago" on the branch.
[23:42:32] jimevans: so i'm kinda bleeding edge here. :)
[23:42:45] detronizator: let me see
[23:43:30] detronizator: AH! I see! the code from Ale landed in 1.6 only for now
[23:43:35] jimevans: if only webkit didn't take, oh, forever to build...
[23:43:37] detronizator: odd a bit, but maybe there is a reasoning behind this
[23:44:12] jimevans: i *do* know of a change that can quiet the warnings down a bit when building under vs 2010.
[23:46:01] jimevans: but that'll have to wait until tomorrow. 
[23:46:06] detronizator: so, you think you can help Alessandro?
[23:46:32] detronizator: I'm not sure I follow 100%: you trying alessandro's code or you are actually aware of an improvement you think you want to commit?
[23:46:45] detronizator: the first would be good - the second would be even better :)
[23:47:09] jimevans: both, but the improvement is only marginal, just quieting down the build output in the console in certain environments.
[23:47:15] jimevans: i am trying his code out now.
[23:47:27] jimevans: the build appears to be progressing. we'll see if it completes.

[23:49:30] detronizator: if it does, u should submit a patch with your "quitening"
[23:49:41] jimevans: i will do that.
[23:50:03] jimevans: for the moment, though, i'm going home. :)
