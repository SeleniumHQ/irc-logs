[00:22:24] ner0x: Anyone know why chromedriver would be shitting out on me?
[00:22:30] ner0x: I can post any info you need to fix.
[00:29:03] llaskin: not super descriptive question is it?
[00:29:19] llaskin: give us details
[00:29:27] llaskin: chances are though, no noone is here right now
[00:29:34] llaskin: check back tmrw morning ish EST
[00:30:08] ner0x: You need to see a stacktrace of the fail?
[00:30:17] ner0x: That's what I was asking, what do you need to see to better determine?
[00:33:40] slex: 1. your error, 2. your test code, 3. your UAT example or code, 4. your enviroment info (how test is ran, browser, etc)
[00:35:00] slex: if you think it's an issue, then you may create just a new
[00:35:03] slex: :)
[00:35:23] ner0x: http://paste.scsys.co.uk/203314
[00:35:26] ner0x: Would this be of help?
[00:36:30] ner0x: The exceptions seem to be coming from driver.version
[00:39:09] slex: are you using chromedriver of correct x64 arch?
[00:39:58] ner0x: I believe so.
[00:40:03] ner0x: linux64 from the download page?
[00:42:19] slex: yea.
[00:42:42] slex: ok, what's about yout test code?
[00:43:33] ner0x: It's anything that starts a session.
[00:43:52] ner0x: So any code possible is valid.
[00:44:07] ner0x: Because when I change it to firefox, works flawlessly.
[00:46:04] slex: i asked because of "proxy=null" and "proxy must be of type dictionary, not null.".
[00:59:16] ner0x: Yeah, Not entirely sure what that's about.

[01:09:07] slex: i need your test code part where you sets up capabilities. also wchich command is used for server/node run?
[01:19:33] spirity has joined #selenium
[01:25:30] slex: ok, her is my investigation's result - chromedriver is faling at http://code.google.com/searchframe#OAMlx_jo-ck/src/chrome/test/webdriver/webdriver_capabilities_parser.cc&q=proxy%20file:^src/chrome/test/webdriver/&l=283
[01:25:49] slex: because of proxy=null parameter is passed in.
[01:26:48] slex: i don't know what is source of problem - issue in wd client or test code - at some point proxy capability becomes null but in this case it should not be passed at all.
[01:27:16] slex: that's all.

[03:35:31] Gates: Hello
[03:35:47] Gates: i have age gate page on load where there are 3 fields MM/DD/YY
[03:35:59] Gates: i have it going in and enter a birthday but that is strange is if i run it too fast
[03:36:03] Gates: it doesnt input data
[03:36:07] Gates: because it cannot find the div tag
[03:40:26] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[03:46:46] Gates: Is there a know webdriver issue with this?
[03:57:37] Gates: Anyone?
[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jul 23 04:33:10 2012]
[04:33:10] spirity: Gates: are you sure the divs are available when the page finishes loading?
[04:33:30] Gates: unless the page didn finish loading?
[04:33:40] Gates: NoSuchElementException: Message: u'Unable to locate element: {"method":"id","selector":"sweeps"}'
[04:33:48] Gates: assert "JOIN THE COMMUNITY" in self.driver.find_element_by_id("sweeps").text
[04:33:54] spirity: an implicit wait may be enough to fix this.
[04:34:03] Gates: what is that
[04:34:13] spirity: driver.set_implicit_wait
[04:34:15] Gates: http://seleniumhq.org/docs/04_webdriver_advanced.html
[04:34:32] spirity: allows you to set a period of time to wait in the event that an element isn't found.
[04:34:48] spirity: before throwing an exception
[04:36:00] spirity: I believe the python bindings are specified in seconds.
[04:36:20] spirity: driver.set_implicit_wait(5)   # wait 5 minutes for an element to appear if it's not found.
[04:36:50] spirity: s/minutes/seconds/
[04:37:03] Gates: ah yes
[04:37:05] Gates: yea it doesnt seem to work
[04:37:10] Gates: i had it
[04:38:49] spirity: Gates: if I understand correctly sometimes javascript can interfere with webdriver, because the page has finished "loading" but the javascript hasn't finished initializing everything.
[04:39:03] Gates: could it be a threading/proccess issue?
[04:39:08] spirity: but I've never encountered this myself, and I'm not much of a web programmer, so I don't know when this occurs or why.
[04:39:09] Gates: can you run more than 1 of the same script ?
[04:39:25] spirity: Gates: javascript doesn't support concurrency as far as I'm aware.
[04:39:30] spirity: unless you're talking about something else.
[04:40:07] Gates: running a selenium script using web driver
[04:40:12] Gates: twice on the same computer
[04:40:14] Gates: at the same time
[04:40:15] spirity: if by "theading/process issue" you mean that your client is executing a selenium command before the javascript has finished
[04:40:28] spirity: then yes, that's could be the problem.
[04:40:35] spirity: oh
[04:40:50] spirity: they would be running in different browsers
[04:40:53] spirity: so that's not a problem
[04:42:12] Gates: this

[04:42:25] Gates: running multiple selenium tests simultaneously
[04:42:36] slex has joined #selenium
[04:44:57] spirity: Gates: like I said each webdriver instance uses a[C[C[C[C[C[C[C[C different browser, so they wouldn't interfere with each other in any way. 
[04:45:10] Gates: well
[04:45:12] spirity: personally I'd use GNU parallel to accomplish that.
[04:45:12] Gates: when i run the script
[04:45:14] Gates: i see it error
[04:45:59] spirity: okay. that's not a very helpful description of the problem. ;)
[04:46:15] spirity: are you saying it doesn't occur when you run a single test?
[04:46:19] spirity: but does when running parallel tests?
[04:46:30] spirity: how many tests are you running in parallel?
[04:57:56] spirity: hello hello hello hello hello hello hello eherihwerweroihjweoihroiwhetouweriouwhetiuwheriuwhetiuwherihwetiuwheriuwhetiuwheriuwhetiuwheriuwhetiuwheriuwhetiuwheriuwhetiuwheruihwerihweruhweruhweuthiwuerhwiuerhuwehtuwehruhwetiuhwiehruiwethuhweruhweuthuwerhuhweiruhweuirhwiuerhiuwehtiuwehriuwehriuwheriuwhetiuhweriuhweriuhwieurhiwuethiuwehriuwehtiuwheriuhwetiuhweriuwheriuwhetiuwheriuwehriuhweriuw

[05:28:03] Gates: spirity: 
[05:33:59] spirity: do you have the bandwidth and resources to handle 31 processes at once?
[05:34:49] spirity: you may want to go with a lower number of processes, but above the number of CPU cores, since selenium is mostly an IO-bound program.

[15:28:24] jimevans: right now, releasing dot-releases of a component involves hacking the version member in the rakefile to get the right name in the zip file. i'm going to play around with reading that from the resources.

[15:35:01] farlan has joined #selenium
[15:36:09] jimevans: simonstewart: i was thinking that instead of a string "version" there could be a hash "versions", where the components would have their own version string value, but for the components I'm worrying about, the version values are already in the source code, and can be parsed from there. so no worries. i got this.

[18:24:27] slex: could someone clarify - is this approach correct for adding logging options for iedriver ran via remote - https://gist.github.com/3153432 https://gist.github.com/3153440 ?
[18:24:59] slex: or should be LoggingPreferences capabilty used + implemented ability to copy log to client from remote node, something else ?
[18:27:24] eranm: slex, my intern is just implementing that
[18:27:35] eranm: If you'll wait 2 days you'll have a working example of fetching logs
[18:27:54] slex: great, i'll wait. 
[18:28:14] eranm: the principle is that there are different log types (i.e. client, driver, browser, performance) . Each driver replies with the types of logs it has and then returns all entries of a specific log, when requested.
[18:28:19] eranm: (The log is then cleared.)

[19:14:06] jimevans: detronizator: for about about 10 minutes, yes
[19:14:29] detronizator: jimevans: windowHandle
[19:14:42] detronizator: implementing proper handling (sorry) of that in ghostdriver (finally)
[19:14:49] jimevans: sure.
[19:15:08] detronizator: I wonder: is it a "good idea" to associate "window name" and "windowHandle"
[19:15:21] detronizator: where "window name" is the result of "window.open(URL, name, ...)"
[19:15:41] detronizator: in other words, is the handle "usually" the name of the window?
[19:15:52] jleyba: no, never
[19:15:54] jimevans: detronizator: no, it's almost never.
[19:16:04] jimevans: s/almost/
[19:16:09] jimevans: i stand corrected.
[19:16:14] detronizator: mmm
[19:16:16] jleyba: window.name is a convenience for switchTo().window
[19:16:41] jleyba: b/c if you know the name, you should be able to switch to it directly without having to figure out its handle
[19:16:50] jleyba: but handles are immutable, and window.name is not
[19:17:17] detronizator: jleyba: (hi - thanks for jumping in)
[19:17:21] detronizator: mmm
[19:17:33] detronizator: so, what do you guys usually use to assign a windowHandle value to a window?
[19:17:45] jimevans: IE uses a UUID.
[19:17:56] jleyba: UUID is best
[19:18:07] jleyba: the SafariDriver uses goog.string.getRandomString from the closure library
[19:18:14] detronizator: UUID is generated by the IE driver? or is it given by IE itself?
[19:18:21] jleyba: generated
[19:18:25] jimevans: it's generated by the driver.
[19:18:50] detronizator: capisco...
[19:19:49] *jleyba will be back in ~15 min
[19:19:50] detronizator: I think I got an idea than
[19:20:10] detronizator: every time PhantomJS says "I got a new window created", I add a UUID to it
[19:20:16] detronizator: randomly generated
[19:20:20] detronizator: and that's it
[19:20:56] jimevans: sounds like that would work very well.
[19:21:01] narayans: I guess you might have to check if doesn't exist already, but you already know that :)
[19:21:07] detronizator: jimevans: jleyba: because u are absolutely right (stupid of me) - window.name can change, hence the list of names of windows object can change
[19:21:59] nirvdrum: jimevans, jleyba: I ported snapsie to NPAPI for full canvas screenshots in Safari (Windows-only right now) over the weekend.
[19:22:07] nirvdrum: It still relies on that window resize hack though.

[19:24:42] detronizator: jimevans: 1 awkward thing though - why the POST /session/:id/window accepts both a windowHandle or a window.name
[19:24:46] detronizator: via the "name" parameter?
[19:24:58] detronizator: it leaves to the driver to work out "where to apply"?

[19:28:41] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: which browser?
[19:28:48] Chuckleteeth: IE9
[19:29:11] Chuckleteeth: its due to the page being refreshed

[19:29:18] Chuckleteeth: while i pole a loading spinner from an ajax event
[19:29:22] Chuckleteeth: er poll
[19:30:06] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: it's a generic error message when the isDisplayed atom returns a non-success result code. if you want more information, bump up the logging in the IEDriverServer.exe.
[19:30:46] jimevans: though what that usually means is there's a javascript error somewhere.
[19:31:15] Chuckleteeth: a javascript error in the atoms or in the page code?
[19:31:30] jimevans: in the atoms.
[19:31:36] Chuckleteeth: hmm : (
[19:31:47] Chuckleteeth: its hard for me to reproduce the race condition consistently
[19:31:49] jimevans: or rather, in the execution of the atom, a non-success code was returned.

[19:34:59] jimevans: okay.
[19:35:49] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: btw, bumping the logging will yield more information about exactly where things are turning pear-shaped.
[19:36:09] Chuckleteeth: where do i do this again? i dont remember
[19:36:30] jimevans: you're using .NET?
[19:36:34] Chuckleteeth: yeah
[19:36:39] Chuckleteeth: .net bindings
[19:37:38] jimevans: grab the latest, and set the appropriate properties on the InternetExplorerDriverService object which is then passed into the InternetExplorerDriver constructor.

[19:45:49] jimevans: barancev: yeah, it's because Navigate2() returns a non-success HRESULT. :)
[19:46:26] barancev: yes, but what changed after 2.25 that causes it?
[19:46:40] jimevans: you have to realize that it's a completely opaque call to the driver. the only reason we weren't failing before is that now we check the HRESULT.
[19:47:19] jimevans: because in the case where there is a non-success HRESULT, if we can hang the driver, waiting forever for a non-busy state.
[19:51:14] barancev: but if we do check the result, our tests fail and we've got regression
[19:51:26] barancev: both ways worse
[19:52:04] jimevans: but the tests don't always fail, otherwise i'd've made the change back by now. see the :ci server for proof that the tests don't fail.

[19:53:03] detronizator: jleyba: I have another question
[19:53:13] jleyba: detronizator: Ok
[19:53:22] detronizator: jleyba: (I know - I'm annoying sometimes :))
[19:53:28] jleyba: It's no problem
[19:53:41] detronizator: jleyba: every "window" it's owned by 1 session
[19:53:50] detronizator: jleyba: there is not "window" owning another "window"
[19:53:51] detronizator: right?
[19:54:02] detronizator: no "hierarchy" here
[19:54:07] jimevans: detronizator: that's the implementation in IE for certain.
[19:54:20] jleyba: right
[19:54:41] detronizator: jimevans: jleyba: so you guys ignore the fact that a window can create another window that can create another window...
[19:54:54] detronizator: everything is "flattened" to the level of the session and given a windowHandle
[19:54:59] jimevans: yep. all of those windows are owned by the session.
[19:55:00] jleyba: detronizator: once it's opened, it gets a window handle.  webdriver doesn't care where it came from
[19:55:42] jleyba: now that I think about it, it would have been nice if we included opener references
[19:55:46] jleyba: but we didn't... so you don't have to worry about it :)
[19:56:16] detronizator: jleyba: jimevans: fine - in PhantomJS I implemented it as a hierarchy, BUT because the memory management is auto-magical (Qt handles closed pages/windows)
[19:56:26] detronizator: I can ignore the hierarchy for WebDriver
[19:57:06] jleyba: if you want to reuse what you already have, that's fine.  all webdriver needs is a 1:1 mapping of string ID to DOMWindow
[19:57:11] detronizator: I just need to register a "listener" on every new "window": 1 callback-handler per session will do the trick - all the pages in that session will share the same callback-handler - so, all new pages are collected in the same sesion
[19:57:54] detronizator: what I want to avoid is having to walk over the three to find the window: and I can do that in this way.
[19:58:01] detronizator: sorry "tree"*
[19:58:05] detronizator: :P
[19:58:37] jimevans: detronizator: that's essentially what IE does. it hooks the NewWindow3 event, and caches the new window created every time a new IE window is created.
[19:58:50] detronizator: jimevans: spot on
[19:58:57] jleyba: Same thing in Safari
[19:58:58] jleyba: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/trunk/javascript/safari-driver/extension/tabmanager.js#51
[19:59:21] detronizator: jimevans: btw, today I got Simon to do an espresso for me. you think he is upset because I preferred that over a Latte?
[19:59:22] detronizator: :)

[IRC logfile - Started Mon Jul 23 20:00:42 2012]
[20:00:42] detronizator: anyway, hopefully I should be able to knockout the final window management in GhostDriver this week - if at work they don't decide another "priority reshuffling"
[20:01:03] jleyba: How much more is there to do?
[20:01:03] jimevans: that'd be awesome.
[20:01:50] jleyba: (for ghostdriver)
[20:03:37] detronizator: jleyba: after the window stuff, I think I need to work on the cookies stuff
[20:03:49] detronizator: phantomJS at the moment lacks there: there is some stuff, but I need better API
[20:04:09] detronizator: after that, local/session storage, click events
[20:04:48] detronizator: click events as in "buttondown" or "doubleclick"
[20:05:00] jleyba: ah, the interactions api
[20:06:14] detronizator: jleyba: we have native events support in phantomjs already
[20:06:28] detronizator: so should be able to do what I need, even though I didn't investigate that yet

[21:02:41] DaveIngram: Hi all, I'm trying to get a test to send some keystrokes inside an iframe (I'm using Saunter PHP), but the iframe doesn't have a name attribute. Does anyone know of a way I can get web driver to switch to an iframe, presumably with this command: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#/session/:sessionId/frame, without using the element's name?
[21:02:42] AutomatedTester: Google Code Y U STILL IN MAINTENANCE MODE!
[21:04:08] AutomatedTester: DaveIngram: you will need to translate this to PHP but element = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'iframe'); driver.switch_to_frame(element)
[21:05:37] DaveIngram: AutomatedTester: Oh, I see… presumably I can use another locator method such as CSS as well, right?
[21:05:45] AutomatedTester: DaveIngram: yea
[21:05:50] AutomatedTester: just find the element
[21:05:58] AutomatedTester: then use that in the switch

[21:23:43] jimevans: jarib: yt?
[21:24:56] jarib: jimevans: yeah
[21:25:47] jimevans: so i have a ruby 1.8 question. i have to read a file that's utf-16, and i can't seem to match line of the file with a regex.
[21:26:05] jimevans: in 1.9, it's easy with str.encode().
[21:26:28] jimevans: but our jruby environment for crazy-fun is 1.8...
[21:27:01] jarib: hmm
[21:27:26] jarib: perhaps add the 'n' flag to the regexp - /foo/n
[21:27:35] jimevans: i'll try that.
[21:30:39] jarib: if that doesn't help you can use the iconv lib to convert it to something that's easier to work with
[21:30:58] jimevans: do we have iconv in the jruby package for crazy-fun?
[21:31:19] jarib: it should work - part of stdlib
[21:31:31] jarib: for jruby i'm sure they have a java implementation of the API
[21:31:41] jarib: (i.e. not actually relying on native iconv)
[21:33:05] jarib: seems to work:
[21:33:05] jarib: $ echo Ã¦Ã¥Ã¸ | iconv -t UTF-16 | java -jar third_party/jruby/jruby-complete.jar -e 'require "iconv"; p Iconv.conv("UTF-8", "UTF-16", STDIN.read)'
[21:33:08] jarib: "\303\246\303\245\303\270\n"
[21:34:08] detronizator has joined #selenium
[21:35:16] jarib: though, 1.8 strings are just byte buffers, so if your regexp contains the correct bytes, that should work too
[21:35:22] jimevans: right.
