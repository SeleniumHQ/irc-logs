[10:01:34] OperaDriver: [operadriver/master] Fix wrong Selenium version in changelog for 0.15 - Andreas Tolf Tolfsen
[10:01:34] OperaDriver has left #selenium
[10:04:20] foolx: good morning everyone! Does anyone know a good solution (java) for unfinished website loading? I start a normal website via driver.open, but it got stuck. Never finishes loading due to "waiting for cdn.bla". So the Open is never finished and the test is shut down via jenkins after way to much time. Is there any way to let selenium itself disrupt this after ... 2 min?

[10:06:20] karol^ has joined #selenium
[10:08:10] AutomatedTester: foolx: there is something that you can add to the capabilities
[10:08:23] AutomatedTester: I cant remember it off hand atm
[10:08:33] AutomatedTester: barancev: might remember
[10:08:38] AutomatedTester: also its only in Beta
[10:08:42] foolx: well, the hint itself could be enough ;)
[10:09:09] foolx: only in beta? the capability for that itself or is it only available in the beta-version of selenium
[10:09:23] AutomatedTester: capability
[10:09:26] AutomatedTester: it might be removed
[10:09:46] foolx: oh... okay, wouldn't like that ;)
[10:10:12] foolx: but i would like to get this fixed, because my tests all run after each other and jenkins just shuts them down after ... 10minutes i guess
[10:10:26] Swadq has joined #selenium
[10:10:31] foolx: and also i don't have a new result then and so the previous one is used ... 
[10:13:08] AutomatedTester: foolx: the real fix is to remove the CDN
[10:13:23] foolx: yeah ... funny ;)
[10:13:50] AutomatedTester: foolx: well look at it this way, if I was your customer and your CDN was that slow that webdriver was timing out
[10:14:02] AutomatedTester: it wouldnt be long till I took my custom elsewhere
[10:14:41] foolx: i do think so too, but still "they" won't listen to me. And we have way to many customers to even consider working without an cdn. 
[10:14:50] foolx: in fact we use several ... and they mostly suck ;)
[10:15:23] foolx: also the page seems to be fully loaded ... it just doesn't finish somehow
[10:27:09] eranm: foolx, what you're after is changing the page loading strategy

[10:38:16] foolx: Ã¤hm, okay, didn't catch that. what is that for?
[10:58:35] foolx: another question: I just try to use internetExplorer instead of firefox as remotewebdriver. It does work at this moment (single test, not working with more than one ie at the same time), but somehow he dislikes the command: driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jul 24 11:16:30 2012]
[11:16:30] eranm: Could be that it's not implemented.
[11:19:22] foolx: okay, but even than, seems to be working ;) other than Chrome
[11:25:36] eranm: Is there an error? 
[11:25:58] foolx: @chrome? yes, one second
[11:26:46] eranm: And for IE?
[11:27:52] foolx: for ie it is working as long as i don't use the timeout
[11:27:58] eranm: For Chrome, file a feature request in http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/list
[11:28:02] foolx: github for the error right?
[11:28:05] eranm: What do you mean, not use the timeout? 
[11:28:21] eranm: It's implicit - the driver is supposed to wait 5 seconds for you before throwing a NoSuchElementException
[11:28:50] foolx: i use "driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);" in my code. Works fine for firefox. IE doesn't like it
[11:30:39] foolx: error @chrome: http://pastebin.com/e0yiS3wK
[11:30:51] detronizator has joined #selenium
[11:30:53] eranm: When you say IE "doesn't like it", is it because IE politely complains or does it actually word that complaint with an error message?
[11:31:56] eranm: foolx, I'd like to point out that in the stack-trace you've posted there's not a single Selenium class
[11:34:19] foolx: eranm: @IE doesn't like it: somehow he now likes it ... I changed my coding to set this timeout directly after creating the driver. He seems to like that ;)

[13:33:31] davehunt: Win 7 is on a VM, so I haven't run the Selenium test against it
[13:33:54] davehunt: Firefox 13 it looks like the hover is not persisting, and Firefox 14 it looks like the hover is not happening at all
[13:34:41] eranm: davehunt, Is that a no, then? :)
[13:35:13] davehunt: Like I say, I haven't run the Selenium 'testHoverPersists' test at all on the VM
[13:35:27] davehunt: My results are from a Mozilla suite that uses hover

[13:44:40] eranm: simonstewart, so what you're saying is ecj and javac perform the same?
[13:45:07] simonstewart: javac for java 7 is actually a little faster
[13:45:12] simonstewart: It never used to be that way
[13:45:30] simonstewart: ecj used to be several tens of seconds faster
[13:45:52] simonstewart: I guess faster processors and a new version of javac have elimated the gap
[13:47:06] simonstewart: SSDs will also start having an impact
[13:47:35] simonstewart: Though with 12GB of RAM (as the test machine had) if the files aren't cached in memory I'd be amazed

[14:35:25] dysuki: hi i'm a newbie and i have a general question... I have an application that's written to work for Internet Explorer only... but i want to use selenium.  is there anyway to script out my test cases manually or some other way since the applicaiton doesn't work with any other browser?
[14:35:56] AutomatedTester: dysuki: Selenium works with all browsers, only Selenium IDE has the Firefox only limitation
[14:36:30] AutomatedTester: dysuki: if you use python, .net, java or ruby then you can drive the browser
[14:36:55] dysuki: AutomatedTester, what about csharp?
[14:37:12] AutomatedTester: dysuki: c# is part of .net

[14:44:19] MicronXD: is there any best practices for dealing with target="_blank" in JSONWireProtocol? When it opens a new tab and removes focus from the old window, I can't really interact with the old window without keeping track of that window id and making sure I switch back to it after I click every link.

[14:45:47] AutomatedTester: MicronXD: are you using PHP
[14:45:49] simonstewart: We'll need to tidy things a little before adding tests (like adding a README and a directory per section)
[14:46:10] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: yea, will do that now
[14:46:18] AutomatedTester: well the initial structure
[14:46:31] AutomatedTester: and then will setup mirroring
[14:46:36] MicronXD: AutomatedTester: node.js
[14:47:14] AutomatedTester: MicronXD: interesting, wonder which binding since as an end user you shouldnt know/care about JSON Wire Protocol
[14:47:44] AutomatedTester: MicronXD: what to do is get all the handles and then iterate to find which window you want

[14:51:38] simonstewart: We moved off JIRA years ago

[14:55:19] redcap_work: so nobody's going to solve this problem ever and the only way to circumvent it is to use dirty hacks?

[15:06:34] AutomatedTester: running on my VPS
[15:06:35] simonstewart: good old cron
[15:06:46] AutomatedTester: why
[15:07:10] AutomatedTester: jimevans: dont forget to follow
[15:07:13] AutomatedTester: :)
[15:08:05] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: is something wrong with my approach?
[15:08:21] simonstewart: nope
[15:08:25] simonstewart: was just curious
[15:08:37] AutomatedTester: your laughter confused me
[15:09:06] simonstewart: Cron is venerable and lovely and has been around for a long time
[15:09:25] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: its what I used for the other mirror
[15:09:39] AutomatedTester: so just updated it to do another task
[15:10:08] jimevans: so judging from the description, this will be the test set for compliance with the spec, no?
[15:10:40] AutomatedTester: jimevans: yea
[15:10:58] jimevans: brilliant!
[15:12:03] *AutomatedTester will update the description to where the real work is being done
[15:12:54] jimevans: how much of this work can be cribbed from the existing webdriver tests?
[15:13:21] AutomatedTester: jimevans: we have learnt a lot from the webdriver tests
[15:13:47] AutomatedTester: we need to use that knowledge and rewrite
[15:13:54] AutomatedTester: so each test will have its own html 
[15:14:08] jimevans: lots of lessons to be learned there. long-term, could this supplant the webdriver tests?
[15:14:26] AutomatedTester: and so on
[15:15:14] simonstewart: jimevans: I think of it as "augment"
[15:15:21] jimevans: fair enough.
[15:15:26] simonstewart: There are going to be things that we want webdriver to do that don't fit in the spec
[15:15:33] simonstewart: (like uploading files to remote hosts)
[15:16:31] jimevans: right. i'm coming at this from two directions. as a driver maintainer and as a language binding maintainer.
[15:16:56] simonstewart: Once the spec tests are looking good we should grab a snapshot of them into our own tree
[15:17:00] AutomatedTester: jimevans: I emailed the Mozilla head rep for W3C to forward an email to Microsoft and Apple

[15:45:18] Dude-X: can the java binding of webdriver executeScript accept a null for the arguments without breaking anything
[15:47:19] Dude-X: if i wanted to execute some js code that doesn't require arguments
[15:51:08] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: should work
[15:51:27] AutomatedTester: execute_script("return 1+1;", null)
[15:51:38] AutomatedTester: or what ever the Java equivalent
[15:54:59] Dude-X: okay
[IRC logfile - Started Tue Jul 24 16:01:17 2012]
[16:01:17] jimevans: Dude-X: the second "arguments" arg of executeScript is optional. if you want to execute a script that doesn't refer to any arguments, you don't need to use it at all. driver.executeScript("return 1 + 1;") should just work
[16:01:34] jimevans: (assuming driver has been properly cast to JavascriptExecutor)
[16:03:01] Dude-X: I wrap the driver API
[16:03:41] Dude-X: a dev thinks I can reduce boilerplate code by just calling the the two argument version from the one argument
[16:03:53] Dude-X: so before i do that, i wonder if null is okay
[16:05:56] retornam has joined #selenium
[16:06:37] jimevans: Dude-X: they're the same signature; it's not an overload. the args argument is declared as "Objectâ€¦". to properly wrap the api, you'd want your wrapper to do the same, i'd think.
[16:07:39] stephend has joined #selenium
[16:07:43] jimevans: it's convenient that i can do this in java: driver.executeScript("return arguments[0] + arguments[1];", 1, 3);
[16:08:05] jimevans: notice how i'm calling executeScript with a variable number of arguments.
[16:08:21] jimevans: not packaging them up into an array or list first.
[16:09:08] jimevans: but it's likely i'm misunderstanding what you're doing.
[16:10:07] Dude-X: oh yeah the method signature is String script, Objectâ€¦ args
[16:10:16] Dude-X: so i don't need to anything special

[16:16:01] detronizator: jimevans: I think I "might" have hit a bug in the IE driver
[16:16:23] jimevans: detronizator: entirely possible. 
[16:16:35] jimevans: i'm quite sure there're bugs in that code. :)
[16:16:54] detronizator: "Element is not displayed" on an input element that is visible and interactive
[16:17:18] detronizator: I was looking for bugs in the issue tracker and on google in general: nothing like this one (yet)
[16:17:34] detronizator: jimevans: sounds familiar?
[16:18:02] aimbire: This ends up making 'selectByValue' compleatly useless.
[16:18:32] jimevans: detronizator: no, but i can tell you all we're doing there is returning the value of the isDisplayed atom.
[16:18:52] detronizator: I'll look at the atom first
[16:19:01] detronizator: if that sounds "reasonable", this might be a IE bug
[16:19:08] jimevans: could be.

[16:35:43] detronizator: jimevans: another one - I didn't look into the IE Driver Architecture. Do you have the Atom JS code inside the IE Server.exe? In other words, does it work as a normal Remote WebDriver via Wire Protocol?
[16:36:16] jimevans: ls
[16:36:25] Dude-X: . ..
[16:36:26] jimevans: oops. wrong window
[16:37:14] jimevans: detronizator: yes. the atoms javascript code gets put into a C++ header file which the driver uses.
[16:38:21] detronizator: k. I was wondering if I should try 2.25 Selenium to see any diff, but there is no point
[16:39:04] jimevans: you can try it. the IEDriverServer should be swappable.
[16:40:15] detronizator: there is no point: if you say that you just return the Atom JS "isDisplayed"
[16:40:21] detronizator: than the issue must be in there
[16:40:23] detronizator: and to be precise
[16:40:39] detronizator: inside "bot.dom.isShown" that is what gets ultimately call
[16:43:58] jleyba: detronizator: is it?
[16:44:12] detronizator: jleyba: yeah, for IE at least
[16:44:18] detronizator: I can't see the same for FF or CHROME
[16:44:32] detronizator: is a pretty simple test over this page: https://home.wpm.neustar.biz
[16:44:47] detronizator: finding the element "name=username" and "name=password"
[16:44:50] detronizator: and than typing in them
[16:46:49] Chuckleteeth: is there any known bugs with selectelement.selectbytext?
[16:47:32] AutomatedTester: Chuckleteeth: look in the issue tracker
[16:47:52] jleyba: detronizator: have you checked the individual parameters that are used to check isDisplayed?
[16:47:53] Dude-X: the implementation is simple, so if there are any bugs is because the selector is not a regular select class
[16:48:42] jleyba: getCssValue("display") != "none"; getCssValue("visibility") != "hidden"; getCssValue("opacity") != "0"; getSize().w > 0; getSize().h > 0
[16:49:33] detronizator: jleyba: that's what I was doing
[16:49:37] detronizator: let me check the size
[16:50:50] detronizator: jleyba: all correct - I can't see anything weird with the element
[16:51:12] detronizator: it is visible and width, height, visibility and so on are all good

[19:26:16] guidefreitas: I get this error - org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: '[JavaScript Error: "a is null" {file: "file:///C:/DOCUME~1/ADMINI~1/CONFIG~1/Temp/anonymous4069399478323305877webdriver-profile/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/components/command_processor.js" line: 5813}]' when calling method: [nsICommandProcessor::execute] 
[19:26:45] guidefreitas: I googled about that but coudn't find any useful answer
[19:27:37] guidefreitas: the problem is that I need to use AutoIT to dismiss the PIN popup because it is an native windows, not an javascript alert
[19:28:41] detronizator has joined #selenium
[19:28:56] guidefreitas: I'm usign WinXP with Selenium (java) 2.24.1 and test with Firefox 8, 13 and 14. I've got the same error in all firefox versions.
[19:31:06] guidefreitas: the problem can be easelly reproduced with the follow steps:
[19:32:09] guidefreitas: 1) driver.get("http://google.com");
[19:32:13] guidefreitas: 2) (JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("alert(1);");
[19:32:21] guidefreitas: 3) click manually to close the alert
[19:32:39] guidefreitas: 4) String tst = driver.getCurrentUrl();
[19:35:56] guidefreitas: anyone?
[19:36:38] jfinley has joined #selenium
[19:38:16] Dude-X: you can't use driver.switchTo().alert().sendKeys()?
[19:40:17] guidefreitas: No, because selenium "can't see" this popup. It a popup opened by firefox when using an smartcard to authenticate
[19:40:35] Dude-X: got it
[19:41:47] guidefreitas: it seems that firefox webdriver extention is in a "modal" mode, waiting to handle the dialog, but as the dialog was aready handled by autoit it can't get out o this "modal" mode

[20:11:27] aimbire: Dude-X: sorry it took so long
[20:11:34] aimbire: was called for a unscheduled meeting
[20:11:48] aimbire: yes it returns the webelement
[20:12:12] aimbire: i can however loop it and get all the values treating them as a element but that kicks some problems
[20:12:37] aimbire: since it is running in a very volatile enviroment, im getting prompted with element no longer being attached to the DOM no more
[20:12:53] AutomatedTester: are Libertarians considered nutters?
[20:13:39] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: sadly a good number of the american tech poplation are right wing Libertarians and are usually not considered libertarians
[20:13:46] Dude-X: err nutters.
[20:13:50] aimbire: i could use another way to grab that works, but im losing so much on performance that way, and that makes me sad ;~
[20:14:17] Dude-X: aimbire: seems like you need a wait somewhere before you grab the options
[20:14:24] Chuckleteeth: Im getting a null reference exception on the perform of my actions chain : (
[20:16:04] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: while Libertarians are annoying, i don't like liberals who may disagree with libertarian free-for-all but are super pro capitalist

[20:16:57] Dude-X: and i mean libertarian in the american sense, not the anarchist sense
[20:19:01] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: all those institutions are right wing libertarian organizations that believe that the government should not absolutely interfere with the market. 
[20:19:30] aimbire: Dude-X: either way i can't consider that being a good usage of the class since im not actually using its native calls and just morphing them myself.
[20:19:39] aimbire: Now here is the tricky part.
[20:19:51] Dude-X: aimbire: i find the select class works best with dumb dropdowns
[20:20:03] aimbire: Im trying to investigate the options from this select element exactly inside a wait.
[20:20:04] Chuckleteeth: So...WebDriverWait
[20:20:08] Dude-X: if the dropdown is on some ajaxy widget, then the select class isn't that sophisticated
[20:20:11] aimbire: What do you mean?
[20:20:27] aimbire: oh, thats good info i guess.
[20:20:35] Chuckleteeth: WebDriverWait.Until() this guy is supposed to wait until the supplied delegate returns true and eats exceptions?
[20:20:43] Dude-X: well, in my applicaiton, i have a selection dropdown that is a javascript widget that uses an unconventional layout
[20:20:48] aimbire: Chuckleteeth: yes.
[20:20:49] Dude-X: Chuckleteeth: yes
[20:20:57] Chuckleteeth: Its not eating the invalidoperation exception
[20:21:04] Chuckleteeth: which occurs during a race condition on .displayed
[20:21:08] Chuckleteeth: when the page is refreshing
[20:21:13] lfryc_ has joined #selenium
[20:21:13] Dude-X: it only catches ElementNotFound you have to catch other exceptions
[20:21:19] Chuckleteeth: : (
[20:21:47] Chuckleteeth: well thats a debbie downer
[20:21:56] Dude-X: you have to write your own ExpectedConditions class (in java) in python make a function that does something similar
[20:22:05] Chuckleteeth: using .net
[20:22:14] Dude-X: yeah but once you have a good webdriver wait condtion, it improves reliability
[20:22:42] Chuckleteeth: well, im trying to poll that an ajax event has finished
[20:22:51] Chuckleteeth: if the ajax event finishes, it will redirect the page
[20:22:52] barancev: declare your own ignored exceptions
[20:23:15] Chuckleteeth: when you mean declare? you mean wrapping the thing in a catch for myself?
[20:23:20] Chuckleteeth: or is there a cleaner way
[20:23:20] aimbire: Dude-X: think there is a way i can grab all the options inside a list without having to further interact with WebElement? I mean like strip all options from a select interacting with this particular webelement only once, then workaround in the language afterwards.

[20:23:56] Dude-X: Chuckleteeth: what binding do you use?
[20:24:01] Chuckleteeth: .net

[20:24:15] Dude-X: i am not familiar with the .net bindings
[20:24:17] lfryc has joined #selenium
[20:24:24] Dude-X: but the java one is kind of similar
[20:24:34] Dude-X: well i think for webdriver wait it looks a bit more like the python one
[20:24:46] DaveIngram has joined #selenium
[20:24:52] stephend has joined #selenium
[20:25:10] Dude-X: either way, you can create your own "expectedConditons" funciton that will attempt the operation you want, and then catch the exceptions to return null/false
[20:25:24] Chuckleteeth: i think im going to have to wrap it...or maybe actually i should make an extention method that includes this case
[20:25:25] barancev: FluentWait<WebDriver> waiter = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10).ignoring(Throwable.class);
[20:25:32] barancev: (in Java)
[20:25:44] Chuckleteeth: yeah im not sure that sort of syntax even exists in c#
[20:25:47] Chuckleteeth: or maybe im missing something
[20:26:13] Dude-X: in some cases you don't want to ignore StaleElementReference if you are only operating on a element and not a locator string/ by object

[20:28:46] barancev: it's much the same as FluentWait in Java
[20:29:40] Chuckleteeth: oo, thank you, i'll check this out
[20:30:01] barancev: oh, no, not a property, but a method

[20:41:10] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: ping?
[20:42:54] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: sorry, i was away when you were asking. yes, there's an IgnoreExceptionTypes method on WebDriverWait. you can pass in exception types that you want to ignore, and the method is cumulative.
[20:43:08] Chuckleteeth: well that solves one problem
[20:43:08] aimbire: Dude-X: Ofc.
[20:43:11] Chuckleteeth: but the other still stands
[20:43:21] jimevans: that is, if you call waiter.IgnoreExceptionTypes(typeof(InvalidOperationException));
[20:43:30] aimbire: I want to know if i can grab all the value from options interacting with the pulldown element only once.
[20:43:46] Chuckleteeth: Im attempting actions.ContextClick on IWebElement, building and performing and its throwing a null reference exception
[20:43:46] aimbire: Like webElement.getAllOptions();
[20:43:49] Chuckleteeth: the element is valid
[20:43:52] jimevans: then call waiter.IgnoreExceptionTypes(typeof(ArgumentNullException)), the wait will ignore both
[20:44:01] Chuckleteeth: the driver given to the actions is also valid
[20:44:02] adamgoucher: DaveIngram: pong?
[20:44:13] aimbire: But not returning into a WebElement, only a regular list, maybe string, or anything that isnt WebElement.
[20:45:15] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: hey. I took your advice and have Saunter PHP up and running some basic tests. I've read through a fair amount of code and will be working with it a fair amount over the coming weeks (possibly months) on a fairly large project..
[20:45:32] Chuckleteeth: so, CompositeAction.Perform() is throwing the null reference
[20:45:34] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: where are you getting the webElement you're passing to the ContextClick() action
[20:45:38] *adamgoucher senses a 'but'
[20:45:51] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: :) ..more of an and...
[20:46:01] Chuckleteeth: Where am i getting it? From the Page Object
[20:46:06] Chuckleteeth: im in immediate mode poking around
[20:46:09] Chuckleteeth: the element is valid
[20:46:09] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: …and I think I may be able to  contribute some to the project while I'm at it.
[20:46:36] Chuckleteeth: the action builds without a problem
[20:46:45] Chuckleteeth: but attempting to perform the built action throws the error
[20:46:53] DaveIngram: I have some thoughts on things like setting up support classes for different element types like a select box (which I've seen some web driver frameworks have, but seem to be missing in the PHP versions.
[20:47:14] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: that's not surprising. .Build() is a pretty simple operation.
[20:47:21] jimevans: and doesn't do any validation.
[20:47:29] DaveIngram: I also might be able to help clarify some documentation since I'm bringing some fresh eyes to the project that don't know much about selenium or webdriver.
[20:47:32] Chuckleteeth: at OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions.Internal.MouseAction.MoveToLocation()
[20:47:32] Chuckleteeth:    at OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions.ContextClickAction.Perform()
[20:47:32] Chuckleteeth:    at OpenQA.Selenium.Interactions.CompositeAction.Perform()
[20:47:38] Chuckleteeth: thats as much information as i got : (

[20:49:19] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: Fair enough :) so I've never contributed to a project like this on github before, so I'm just wondering if you would like me to contribute some of my thoughts while working on this, and if so, what's the best mechanism to do so?
[20:49:41] adamgoucher: DaveIngram: fork / pull
[20:49:50] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: you're not, by any chance using EventFiringWebDriver, are you?
[20:50:03] Chuckleteeth: RemoteWebDriver
[20:50:39] jimevans: just checking.
[20:51:12] jimevans: if the IWebElement is valid, then it's likely that the IMouse member of the Actions class is what's null, but i'm speculating here.
[20:51:12] Chuckleteeth: the only additional capability im setting is ignoreProtectedModeSettings
[20:51:28] Chuckleteeth: this is ie9 btw, but pretty sure thats unrelated as no commands even make it to the driver
[20:51:35] mdas_ has joined #selenium
[20:51:58] jimevans: but that's only going to happen if your driver object doesn't implement IHasInputDevices, which RemoteWebDriver does.
[20:52:05] Chuckleteeth: im updating my webdriver source atm 
[20:52:12] jimevans: (EventFiringWebDriver doesn't, which is why i asked)
[20:52:41] Chuckleteeth: is there an easy way for me to debug the dll from a seperate visual studio solution?
[20:52:50] Chuckleteeth: thats being used in the main project?
[20:55:38] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: sure. build the webdriver assembly
[20:55:49] jimevans: then reference your built assembly in your other project.
[20:55:58] jimevans: (that'll get the source code hints properly aligned.
[20:56:00] jimevans: )
[20:56:42] jimevans: i'd recommend building the debug configuration, rather than the release on.

[21:08:09] testingb0t1 has joined #selenium
[21:09:07] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: One thought that occurred to me (and I might just do this within my own test suite) is to expand the concept of locators in the page object to include a "type" key as well as the locator string itself, which would make it possible to just define things like 'html', 'text input' or 'select' and eliminate or reduce the lengthy __set and __get functions for every page object. Any thoughts on that concept?
[21:10:33] adamgoucher: DaveIngram: if it makes sense for you, then it makes sense. i dont mind the lengthy gets and sets. and means the scripts are cleaner (i think)
[21:11:04] Swadq has joined #selenium
[21:11:08] Chuckleteeth: WARN: No Firefox extension found
[21:12:41] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: fair enough. My thinking is to avoid having to rewrite set and get methods for text inputs and such on every page object, but to just say "this is a text input" in the locator selectors and then get and set just work. But if you don't like the idea then I'll just subclass the page object for my test suite instead of trying to add that to the project.

[21:22:44] chogan has joined #selenium
[21:22:52] Chuckleteeth: ok well the reason i was trying to build the firefox one
[21:23:02] Chuckleteeth: is because the webdriver project wont compile
[21:23:07] Chuckleteeth: because it claims its missing the firefox-driver
[21:23:41] jimevans: unless you're running the 'go' build script, you're missing a shit-ton of dependencies. mozilla sdks in particular.\
[21:24:02] Chuckleteeth: err
[21:24:10] *jimevans really needs to separate these out into separate solutions
[21:24:25] Chuckleteeth: you mean i need the mozilla sdk's to build the firefox driver?
[21:24:35] Chuckleteeth: which is required to build the webdriver .net bindings?
[21:24:37] jimevans: the firefox extension, yes. it's a c++ project
[21:24:43] detroniz_ has joined #selenium
[21:24:47] jimevans: no, it's not technically required.
[21:25:02] Chuckleteeth: ok well if i run go, will that build the mozilla extentions stuff that i need?
[21:25:43] jimevans: assuming you have all the other stuff you need to build (a java jdk installation, a python installation for anything remotely approaching decent build performance).
[21:25:58] jimevans: wait.
[21:26:05] jimevans: the build fails for the .NET bindings?
[21:26:07] Chuckleteeth: please explain the python installation
[21:26:10] jimevans: it shouldn't
[21:26:11] Chuckleteeth: because go DOES run slow
[21:26:27] Chuckleteeth: the 'WebDriver' .net project is the .net bindings correct?
[21:26:56] jimevans: put python 2.<mumble> on your path to speed up the closure compilation of the javascript code. it still won't be *fast*, but it'll be faster.
[21:27:51] jimevans: but yes, the WebDriver C# project is the .NET bindings.
[21:29:22] Chuckleteeth: yeah that fails

[21:33:32] jimevans: the post-build step is just a batch file. it shouldn't be returning any sort of status code.

[21:34:23] Chuckleteeth: you mean this line? <Exec WorkingDirectory="$(OutDir)" Command="$(PostBuildEvent)" /> ?
[21:34:57] Chuckleteeth: or the entire target?
[21:35:32] jimevans: well, i was doing it within the IDE (right click on the WebDriver project, choose "Properties", and go to the Build Events tab.
[21:35:33] jimevans: )
[21:36:10] Chuckleteeth: well yeah
[21:36:12] Chuckleteeth: that works
[21:36:15] jimevans: just delete the entire contents of the Post-buld event command line.
[21:36:50] jimevans: and you're building now?
[21:36:53] Chuckleteeth: yeah
[21:36:55] Chuckleteeth: its built
[21:36:58] Chuckleteeth: one thing im confused there
[21:37:02] Chuckleteeth: if you look at what it echoed
[21:37:12] Chuckleteeth: it said it was copying first
[21:37:19] Chuckleteeth: which means it passed the if exist check
[21:37:57] Chuckleteeth: but it also echoed the warning of it not being there
[21:38:58] jimevans: yeah, that's odd. possibly couldn't write to the output directory? i doubt that.
[21:39:24] jimevans: anyway, this should get you back to where you can debug your null reference.
[21:39:53] jimevans: we can diagnose the post-build event later. better to not get sidetracked on that.
[21:40:41] AutomatedTester: hurray! my cron task worked

[21:44:24] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: i just did exactly this two hours ago. i didn't do anything special. i set a breakpoint in my console application project that references webdriver, and was able to step into the constructor for InternetExplorerOptions just fine.
[21:44:46] Chuckleteeth: console app : /
[21:44:56] jimevans: Chuckleteeth: shouldn't matter.
[21:45:02] Chuckleteeth: hmm 
[21:45:13] jimevans: how are you executing your code?
[21:45:30] Chuckleteeth: uhh, via the mbunit resharper plugin
[21:45:38] Chuckleteeth: it runs the gallio test runner
[21:47:04] jimevans: of *course* it couldn't be simple.
[21:47:06] jimevans: sigh
[21:47:27] Chuckleteeth: yea i know
[21:47:58] jimevans: other options: run the gallio test runner manually and attach to the process from visual studio.
[21:48:06] jimevans: that *might* work

[21:54:41] Chuckleteeth: the driver cast as an IHasInputDevices returned null
[21:55:52] Swadq has joined #selenium
[21:57:31] Chuckleteeth: so yeah jim, thats the problem
[21:58:21] Chuckleteeth: the constructor has some fallback if hte driver doesn't cast correctly but there is no validation later to check if the mouse or keyboard are nulls
[21:59:29] jimevans: so how in the hell is the cast to IHasInputDevices failing? if it's a raw RemoteWebDriver (or any of its direct subclasses), that cast should succeed.
[21:59:38] Chuckleteeth: it is not
[21:59:47] Chuckleteeth: it appears one of the developers wrapped it
[21:59:53] Chuckleteeth: into something that implements IWebDriver
[21:59:56] Chuckleteeth: and IWrapsDriver

[22:03:29] Chuckleteeth: So shouldn't the constructor for Actions require an IHasInputDevices?

[22:03:29] jimevans: so pass yourWhateverWrapperClassYouveWrappedItIn.WrappedDriver.
[22:03:29] ian_mac_ has joined #selenium
[22:03:29] Chuckleteeth: because IWebDriver doesn't include IHasInputDevices

[22:03:30] Chuckleteeth: actions shouldn't take an IWebElement is all im saying
[22:03:31] Chuckleteeth: or at least have some sorta failure if the driver you pass doesn't

[22:38:10] Actine: One minute please
[22:38:45] *jleyba hates python
[22:39:02] *Dude-X is shocked.
[22:39:15] *jleyba hates all scripting languages where devs don't document the damn types they're using
[22:39:32] Dude-X: duck typing herp derp
[22:39:41] Dude-X: but yeah i think some type documentation does help with python
[22:39:59] Actine: https://gist.github.com/66fa4992214c0ef821ea
[22:40:29] jimevans: Actine: yep. that'll be null outside that method.
[22:41:04] Actine: What should be done to fix it?
[22:41:17] jimevans: please hold, caller
[22:41:18] Actine: Other browsers do the testing with flying colors
[22:41:27] AutomatedTester: Actine: create the variable outside of the method
[22:41:55] detronizator: lulz
[22:41:59] Actine: Should I provide you with LoginAbstractTest as well?
[22:42:12] Actine: webDriver is a protected static there
[22:42:16] detronizator: Actine: to do what you want to do, have the "driver" as a member variable of the test class
[22:42:34] AutomatedTester: Actine: i would be surprised if other browsers work with that code
[22:42:36] detronizator: crap: it's a static - nevermind
[22:42:49] Actine: I did inheritance because I had to do the same testing in different browsers
[22:43:21] Actine: and the best way I thought would be to do it is to make one parent class and a few children with setUpClass overrides
[22:43:42] jimevans: i'm not sure static is what you want.
[22:44:04] detronizator: ct
[22:44:13] Actine: https://gist.github.com/d17f7cc5a28c17f1f99e
[22:44:17] detronizator: Actine: what about than having the driver as static too
[22:44:42] Actine: well, it works well in Firefox, Chrome and Opera. except for Chrome's infamous findElements bug
[22:45:19] AutomatedTester: infamous?
[22:45:42] AutomatedTester: what bug is that
[22:46:07] jimevans: but, you could accomplish the same thing with this: https://gist.github.com/e3d1e803207f0c3b34e7
[22:47:25] detronizator: jimevans: I think @BeforeClass needs to be used with static methods http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/BeforeClass.html
[22:47:31] AutomatedTester: yay... emails to both Apple and Microsoft
[22:47:45] detronizator: but if he has the driver as a member var
[22:47:46] jimevans: oh, and in your first gist, you are declaring webDriver to be local to the method.
[22:48:08] jimevans: which i'd bet he's not doing in the Firefox and Chrome case.
[22:48:21] jimevans: s/he's/you're/
[22:48:21] Actine: AutomatedTester: about the bug: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/selenium-developers/1Voq2r352I0 and like http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3624#makechanges
[22:48:27] detronizator: jimevans: I think we have to assume that was "a short" version of his code
[22:48:43] detronizator: the second gist is the right one, right Actine?
[22:49:29] Actine: Uhm... One moment. I'll provide you with the full first gist
[22:49:33] jimevans: i'm sure, but nevertheless, in the IE-specific version he posted, he was declaring a *local* webDriver variable, which is scoped local to the before-class method. the protected-static one in the parent class is never being set.
[22:49:38] Actine: the second is full

[22:50:38] Actine: this is the first gist
[22:51:02] detronizator: Actine: ok
[22:51:10] Actine: other child classes are written in the same manner, only FirefoxDriver, OperaDriver and ChromeDriver
[22:51:14] jimevans: I'm telling you, in your LoginInternetExplorerTest class's setUpClass() method, change "WebDriver webDriver = new InternetExplorerDriver();" to just "webDriver = new InternetExplorerDriver();" (no quotes)
[22:51:20] detronizator: Actine: just get rid of the "type" WebDriver in front of the line where you create the WebDriver instance
[22:51:37] detronizator: yep, what jimevans just wrote basically :)
[22:51:51] Actine: dammit! silly me ><
[22:51:54] Actine: thanks
[22:51:57] jimevans: np
[22:52:03] jimevans: and with that, i'm off.

[22:52:51] AutomatedTester: ffs my internet connection is pissing me off
[22:53:24] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: have you ever wrote a wait method on a mutating attribute
[22:53:48] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: like classes?
[22:54:18] Dude-X: i am thinking of style in this case
[22:55:06] Dude-X: div class = 'blah' style ='width: blah' ; where style would have a height value too when it's mutating
[22:55:14] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: I havent
[22:55:24] AutomatedTester: but... the mozilla webqa blogged about that recently
[22:55:40] Dude-X: so far i did that for an animatd widget; but it's brittle to rely on numbers 
[22:55:41] AutomatedTester: and I cant get the link because my internet connection is crap
[22:55:44] Actine: uhm... okay... next problem. IEDriver doesn't want to work with cookies well. org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Unable to add cookie to page on every @Before ( https://gist.github.com/d17f7cc5a28c17f1f99e )
[22:56:00] Dude-X: i think they said not to wait on attribute changes in general because it's unreliable
[22:56:07] Actine: I downloaded the latest server, unchecked protected mode. nothing helps
[22:56:20] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: that sounds reasonable
[22:56:23] Actine: the latest driver*
[22:57:20] Dude-X: so far it works well in this case! but knowing what i read, there has to be a better way...
[22:57:38] Actine: and strangely I can't find any information on the web about such problems
