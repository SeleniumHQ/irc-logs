[10:52:57] eranm: Ah. That's not quite the fix.
[10:53:32] barancev: I know, but before r17633 native events were always off on sauce

[10:53:48] eranm: And now you could.
[10:54:15] barancev: yes, in 17633 you've fixed it
[10:54:35] eranm: Ok, I'm looking into that, I have to point out that disabling these two calls will make native events behave *very* erratically on Linux when you have more than one window
[10:54:55] barancev: before this commit all our tests were running with synthetic events, no matter what capabilities you specified
[10:56:28] rath-work: barancev: do you mean instead of using functions from WebDriverBackedSelenium, better using class "Action" with the WebDriver?!
[10:56:29] barancev: eranm: yes, I know I've "fixed" it wrong, but at least it stops quitting browser, and all tests are green
[10:57:07] barancev: eranm: well, not all, testChordControlCutAndPaste is failing, Ctrl-V does not work on sauce
[10:57:16] barancev: rath-work: exactly

[11:01:34] barancev: eranm: do you think disabling notifications to x_ignore_nofocus is a showstopper for 2.26?
[11:01:54] barancev: in view of the fact, that all the testas are green on sauce
[11:02:48] eranm: barancev, I'd very much like to uncomment it. In the past danielwh pointed out the same problem, so I may have a subversion client somewhere with a partial fix
[11:04:23] barancev: eranm: if I uncomment it, tests will fail here and there again, is it a better situation than the current one?
[11:04:58] eranm: barancev, the fact that I've never seen it happen in a real tests hints it may not be such a big problem
[11:06:04] barancev: I'd suggest to keep them commented unless The Proper Fix will be provided
[11:06:26] barancev: at least it makes CI usable as a safety net to fix other parts
[11:07:34] eranm: I'm looking into that now. Hopefully I'll have a fix today. When you've been able to reproduce it locally, was it on a 32-bit or 64-bit system? Which CPU, linux distro and window manager?
[11:09:44] barancev: VirtualBox VM, Xubunty 11 32bit with its default windows manager (with mouse logo)
[11:09:54] eranm: ok
[11:09:59] barancev: Xfce, right?
[11:10:13] eranm: Could be
[11:10:32] eranm: Each window manager behaves differently, I've only tested on Gnome and KDE
[11:12:00] barancev: http://www.xfce.org/ -- it seems to be KDE-based
[11:13:13] eranm: nope, much more lightweight than KDE
[11:14:25] barancev: it has a dependency on GTK+ and GLib
[11:16:02] barancev: well it reproduced in my Xubuntu, and on sauce, al least two different environments, so it's not very environment-specific

[16:22:55] eranm: hi jimevans 
[16:23:38] jimevans: so thanks to barancev, it looks like the firefox woes on windows are due to sauce using windows server 2003 instead of windows xp.
[16:24:09] eranm: yeah
[16:24:25] eranm: The "fix" for native Firefox on linux isn't really a fix
[16:24:43] eranm: I hope to get rid of this component once testing mode for the focus manager actually works on Firefox
[16:24:43] barancev: I know it is not :)
[16:24:44] jimevans: no, it's not. we need to revisit that, but i want to wait until after 2.26.
[16:24:52] eranm: Ok
[16:25:09] jleyba has joined #selenium
[16:25:09] jimevans: we've lived with it for this long, one more release won't matter.
[16:25:27] eranm: It's been working well in the real world, just causing some tests to fail
[16:25:38] jleyba: :log
[16:25:38] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/10/26.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[16:25:47] eranm: Anyway, as long as there's a note about it in the release notes I'm ok
[16:26:33] jimevans: so we need to manually run the firefox tests on the versions of firefox we support, or fix the native events piece for windows 2003.
[16:26:45] jimevans: (though i can't imagine how w2k3 broke it)
[16:26:48] eranm: something along the lines of: "With native events turned on, tests that use Firefox on Linux and have multiple windows may behave differently."
[16:27:26] jleyba: differently how
[16:28:27] barancev: jimevans: I've created two more jobs on CI:
[16:28:39] barancev: Firefox 10 Vista Native Java Tests -- http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2010%20Vista%20Native%20Java%20Tests/
[16:29:06] barancev: Firefox 16 XP Synthesized Java Tests - http://ci.seleniumhq.org:8080/job/Firefox%2016%20XP%20Synthesized%20Java%20Tests/
[16:29:37] barancev: they are both work better than Server 2003 + native evewnts
[16:30:05] barancev: (Vista == Windows Server 2008, XP == Windows Server 203)
[16:32:34] barancev: jleyba: I have a question re: r16498 -- why @Ignore annotations were replaced with assumptions?
[16:32:37] selbot2: 03jmleyba@gmail.com 6 months ago - JasonLeyba: Replace some @Ignores with JUnit4 assumptions. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=16498 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=16498
[16:32:41] eranm: jleyba, native input may only work on the most-recently opened window :)
[16:33:20] jleyba: eranm: SGTM :)
[16:34:07] jimevans: so can somebody look into why copy-paste is broken on firefox?
[16:34:30] toabctl has joined #selenium
[16:34:57] jleyba: barancev: idiomatic junit.  we also don't need to track @Ignores on touch interactions b/c they're not relevant to most of our drivers
[16:35:34] jleyba: also, if someone were to implement the touch interactions for one of those browsers, they'd have to remember to update the @Ignores annotation before the tests would run
[16:35:34] barancev: jleyba: as the result: 1) they are not present in :ignores
[16:35:35] selbot2: http://ignores.ci.seleniumhq.org/
[16:36:04] jleyba: barancev: doesn't matter b/c of 2)
[16:36:35] barancev: 2) more important -- we start browser to run a test, and stop it because assumption failed
[16:36:40] jimevans: also, is it possible to categorize the jobs in jenkins as synthetic vs. native events? we already have tabs for "javascript vs. java". it's really getting challenging to parse out the actual status of native vs synthetic events.
[16:37:09] barancev: jleyba: e.g. for chrome these tests take 6 minutes out of total 21, just to start and stop browser
[16:37:31] jleyba: barancev: that's a bug in our test runner then, not a fault of using assumptions
[16:37:51] jleyba: we should be use far more assumptions (e.g. anywhere we bail out of a test with an early return; should be an assumption)
[16:38:16] jimevans: (i'd look into the jenkins config myself, but i don't have that particular set of keys)
[16:38:43] barancev: jleyba: ok, I see your point, will try to fix test runner
[16:39:10] barancev: jimevans: I'll create more views

[16:54:05] jimevans: i'm completely distressed that we've gone as long as we have without a release. we've managed to miss not one, but two firefox releases. i'd come to rely on our CI server, only to find out it's thoroughly unreliable due to platform issues.

[18:21:39] jimevans: every function called in event_firing_thread.cpp checks to see if gEnablePersistentEventFiring is true or that hConstantEventsThread != NULL before executing anything.
[18:22:33] jimevans: and neither of those conditions are true unless specifically set by the driver somewhere.

[19:07:32] jimevans: we're still struggling with the ci server for firefox native events on windows. barancev has narrowed it down to the specific checkin, but i don't see how that code change would affect firefox. we've also got a copy-paste issue in firefox that seems legitimate.
[19:07:50] AutomatedTester: ok
[19:08:01] AutomatedTester: so the email to the mailing list said we were good
[19:08:11] barancev: jimevans: I think it is related to pausing event queue

[19:16:09] AutomatedTester: ok...

[19:16:41] AutomatedTester: jimevans: well there is only one way to really find out
[19:16:59] jimevans: got a meeting. back in 15
[19:17:01] KaibutsuX: does anyone know a reliable method for blurring the entire page?
[19:17:17] KaibutsuX: my thought is "//body".click()
[19:17:24] AutomatedTester: I am not being flippant but I think that might be the best way
[19:17:59] KaibutsuX: do i run the risk of clicking on some other element that happens to be on top of the body
[19:18:05] KaibutsuX: or will only the body receive the event?
[19:18:35] jimevans: part of my frustration is that i've repeatedly asked for volunteers to run the firefox tests on various operating systems using native events over the last two weeks. i've had no takers.
[19:18:54] *AutomatedTester is currently lacking the resources

[22:07:47] barancev: lukeis: you mentioned him, and the result
[22:08:04] lukeis: i summoned him ;)
[22:08:16] stephend: mmm, 2.26.0
[22:08:16] barancev: yessss
[22:08:18] lukeis: i have powers beyond my understandingâ€¦ muahahaha
[22:08:19] stephend: can't wait.
[22:08:29] jimevans: stephend: monday.
[22:08:40] simonstewart: Was going to do a deploy to see if my changes worked
[22:08:53] lukeis: ok, you should be able to
[22:09:05] stephend: suh-weet
[22:09:05] lukeis: i'm just checking locally first
[22:09:12] stephend: <3 all
[22:09:23] simonstewart: I did. Looked fine for me on the pages I looked at
[22:09:24] jarib has joined #selenium
[22:09:27] lukeis: ok
[22:09:37] simonstewart: barancev: did you speak to eranm about the changes to the x ignore no focus stuff?
[22:09:53] jimevans: simonstewart: are there instructions on deploying the maven build?
[22:09:55] barancev: simonstewart: yes, I've answered to the group
[22:10:02] simonstewart: Groovy
[22:10:04] simonstewart: Thank you
[22:10:26] *jimevans has never had to do anything with the maven build before.
[22:10:41] lukeis: simonstewart: okâ€¦ it makes the footer biggerâ€¦ but doesn't look like an issue
[22:10:51] simonstewart: Jesus. That's horrible (barancev)
[22:10:52] simonstewart: Oh well
[22:11:06] simonstewart: jimevans: the releasing selenium notes are basically what I follow
[22:11:13] simonstewart: I'd rope in krosenvold to help
[22:11:38] jimevans: simonstewart: just making sure they were up to date. assuming i don't need any special keys to get it out in the wild.
[22:11:41] barancev: simonstewart: what's horrible?
[22:11:44] lukeis: jimevans: I can also do the maven deploy if you'd likeâ€¦ (if I'm around in the morning on monday)
[22:12:17] simonstewart: The fact that we're leaving Linux users who use native events out to dry
[22:12:24] simonstewart: Shitty way to treat people
[22:12:42] jarib: :release status
[22:12:51] jarib: that'd be nice to have
[22:12:54] simonstewart: lukeis: the app engine java jdk is healthy and large
[22:12:54] jarib: are we releasing?
[22:13:03] lukeis: simonstewart: that it is...
[22:13:15] simonstewart: Oh well. Hopefully there aren't too many people using native events on firefox on linux
[22:13:18] simonstewart: we'll find out
[22:13:18] jimevans: lukeis: i'll take you up on that. i don't have any of the maven plumbing installed at the moment.
[22:13:21] jarib: :log
[22:13:21] selbot2: http://illicitonion.com/selogs/selenium/2012/10/26.txt | http://illicitonion.com/selogs/search
[22:13:24] simonstewart: (we should add a note to the CHANGELOG)
[22:13:26] jimevans: jarib: monday
[22:13:41] jimevans: simonstewart: i'll take care of that
[22:13:53] barancev: simonstewart: unless they run several foxes they are ok
[22:13:57] simonstewart: Thank you
[22:13:58] jarib: jimevans: noted
[22:14:11] simonstewart: barancev: or "any other X app", if memory serves
[22:14:26] simonstewart: It's to do with stopping firefox from noticing that the "no focus" event has fired in X
[22:14:32] simonstewart: So firefox always thinks it has focus
[22:14:38] jimevans: simonstewart: i could easily be convinced to hold off, if i could be reasonably sure eranm would have a fix ready on monday.
[22:15:01] barancev: yes, eranm told that he has a "semi-fix"
[22:15:11] simonstewart: I doubt he'll move that fast without someone pushing
[22:15:21] simonstewart: Things were hectic at Google before I left
[22:15:29] simonstewart: Can't imagine it's a lot less hectic now
[22:16:25] jimevans: well, i'm pretty fed up with the world at the moment, so my frustration level is very high.
[22:16:47] barancev: simonstewart: can you imagine that linux with native events never worked on sauce? :)
[22:16:49] *lukeis hugs jimevans 
[22:17:04] simonstewart: I find it hard to believe
[22:17:06] simonstewart: But possible
[22:17:10] barancev: now we fixed it
[22:17:18] barancev: eranm fixed
[22:17:31] simonstewart: See, I'm too cynical
[22:18:14] barancev: it was fixed by unblessed 17633, coincidentely
[22:18:50] simonstewart: Ha!
[22:18:54] simonstewart: r
[22:18:55] barancev: that broke all our CI because native events *all of a sudden* starts to work!
[22:18:59] simonstewart: r17633

[22:19:15] AutomatedTester: oh hai simonstewart
[22:19:15] simonstewart: Wow. That must have been fun to find out
[22:19:50] lukeis: everyone owes barancev large amounts of alcohol of his choosing for this release
[22:20:18] barancev: what if I don't drink?
[22:20:26] lukeis: drug of choice?
[22:20:27] lukeis: :)
[22:20:34] AutomatedTester: barancev: simonstewart and I will look after them for you
[22:20:41] AutomatedTester: the alcohol
[22:20:45] barancev: deal
[22:20:48] simonstewart: Aye. Booze when we see you
[22:21:30] barancev: eranm broke windows server 2003 tests too
[22:21:42] barancev: I think we should change :whobrokeit
[22:21:42] selbot2: simonstewart
[22:21:53] simonstewart: Sounds like it
[22:21:55] simonstewart: :)
[22:22:20] lukeis: eventually we should get that hooked up to the last build failure in ci ;)
[22:22:22] jleyba has joined #selenium
[22:22:53] simonstewart: Pfft.
[22:23:12] simonstewart: So, how do people feel about starting a new habit: if a revision breaks the build, we revert it
[22:23:31] lukeis: means we need all green builds first
[22:23:34] simonstewart: Because this release has been a PITA partly because we let the build stay broken
[22:23:38] lukeis: but i like it
[22:23:51] simonstewart: lukeis: we just get more aggressive as builds go green
[22:23:58] barancev: jleyba: I've separated touch tests from the main test set, and now all the jobs on CI are about twice fatser
[22:23:59] simonstewart: So whatever is green now should stay that way
[22:24:37] simonstewart: lukeis: now I need to figure out what my app engine password is
[22:24:38] jarib: isn't the problem primarily flakiness? i.e. the revert could also break 
[22:24:41] simonstewart: I bet there's a one time one
[22:24:47] jimevans: alright. i've got to get out of here. we've got builds finishing on the CI server at least.
[22:24:51] Ardesco_Home: arse you are taking out native events on *nix
[22:25:01] simonstewart: jarib: we should really be fixing the flakiness ;)
[22:25:02] barancev: and I have to say that it's impossible to fix test runner because your assumption in TouchTestBase check the driver object (that should be instantiated obviousely)
[22:25:05] lukeis: Ardesco_Home: no
[22:25:07] Ardesco_Home: (may not have read all the way yet)
[22:25:10] jimevans: nobody. touch. anything.
[22:25:15] simonstewart: I know that dawager has spent a huge amount of effort on it
[22:25:55] jarib: simonstewart: right, that seems like a higher priority than "revert on red". question is how 
[22:26:12] simonstewart: Well, if we start by reverting on two reds in a row....
[22:26:23] simonstewart: we can separate "flaky" from "broken"
[22:26:37] jarib: though i'm definitely +1 on a stricter policy around broken builds
[22:26:45] Ardesco_Home: phew i don't have to fiddle to make the tests run on CI next week )
[22:27:16] jarib: simonstewart: is there a tool that will let us separate the two easily? or can we write one?
[22:27:27] simonstewart: No tool right now
[22:27:46] simonstewart: lukeis: ah ha! I needed an app specific password
[22:27:48] simonstewart: *sigh*
[22:27:53] jarib: let's write one then.
[22:27:54] lukeis: ha :)
[22:28:02] jimevans: in my absence, for the love of all that's holy, can someone who knows something about the firefox driver please figure out why we have the copy-paste issue for linux native events?
[22:28:14] lukeis: simonstewart: mine is the same as my lukeis@seleniumhq.org account
[22:28:25] simonstewart: I have two factor auth on
[22:28:32] barancev: the longest test job now is windows ff tests ~22 min
[22:30:11] barancev: simonstewart: here is the prototype implementation of "separate page for each test case" idea: https://codereview.appspot.com/6789045/
[22:31:01] AutomatedTester: simonstewart: I think we need to do like browser vendors... spot flaky tests and track them
[22:31:07] simonstewart: Right chaps, what do we think of: http://1.sehq-docs.appspot.com/sponsor/
[22:31:28] AutomatedTester: _1
[22:31:29] AutomatedTester: -1
[22:31:36] AutomatedTester: do we need money?
[22:31:52] barancev: simonstewart: if one sets @UseTestSpecificPage annotation on a method, selenium test runner automatically opens a page <class name>/<test name>.html
[22:31:56] simonstewart: Ahh.. barancev you're tying the page name to the test name?
[22:32:03] jleyba: -1
[22:32:07] simonstewart: -1
[22:32:25] simonstewart: jleyba: -1 for barancev or sponsorship?
[22:32:39] AutomatedTester: sponsorship == -1
[22:32:42] jleyba: ^
[22:32:48] simonstewart: How come?
[22:32:54] AutomatedTester: do we need money?
[22:33:05] simonstewart: Without the google ads, we have no income
[22:33:22] AutomatedTester: right... but do we need money?
[22:33:23] jleyba: The selenium-dev list has been overrun by consultants wanting to be listed on our site.  opening the project to donations will make that worse
[22:33:24] simonstewart: so, we're okay right now, but at some stage we won't be
[22:33:42] barancev: ok, I can wait with technical questions :)
[22:33:52] Ardesco_Home: are you going to limit sponsors?
[22:33:59] simonstewart: jleyba: then it's not sponsorship you're -1 to, it's that particular imll?
[22:34:17] Ardesco_Home: otherwise you will have something looking like the £1,000,000 pixel page but arger
[22:34:18] Ardesco_Home: :)
[22:34:22] Ardesco_Home: *larger
[22:34:30] simonstewart: That would be a nice problem to have
[22:34:35] AutomatedTester: when we need money we can go ask for sponsorship money
[22:34:50] AutomatedTester: but people will not get anything for it other than a good feeling
[22:34:53] Ardesco_Home: in all honesty, most large companies would probably throw $50 your way for a years worth of advertising
[22:34:53] AutomatedTester: maybe a sticker
[22:34:56] simonstewart: As it is, companies need to pay $5k to get on the front page
[22:35:01] Ardesco_Home: I can see that price point getting very crowded
[22:35:18] simonstewart: OK. So, we bump up the price to $10k?
[22:35:26] AutomatedTester: well if we are going to put their logos on cant we just put google ads back on?
[22:35:35] jleyba: At the very least the sponsorship page needs to make it clear you're not buying influence over the project
[22:35:49] AutomatedTester: jleyba: ++
[22:35:50] simonstewart: The logos are for a charitble donation
[22:36:01] simonstewart: jleyba: point taken.
[22:36:09] simonstewart: the ads are a commercial thing
[22:36:17] AutomatedTester: and I dont want their logos on the site
[22:36:19] simonstewart: That has repercussions with the SFC
[22:36:29] AutomatedTester: they get a warm fuzzy feeling
[22:36:44] simonstewart: AutomatedTester: anyone in particular?
[22:37:08] AutomatedTester: I wouldnt even want the Mozilla logo on the site
[22:37:23] simonstewart: Then make the donation and ask for your logo not to go up :)
[22:37:44] jleyba: simonstewart: what do we need this money for?
[22:37:50] AutomatedTester: in that case its an overwhelming -1
[22:37:53] simonstewart: Things like SeConf
[22:38:02] simonstewart: Flying contributors there if necessary
[22:38:07] simonstewart: (which we've done before)
[22:38:12] simonstewart: servers
[22:38:21] simonstewart: our own hardware
[22:38:56] simonstewart: If we find we're sitting on way too much, we can always stop accepting sponsorship
[22:39:04] simonstewart: But SeConf ran at a slight loss last year
[22:39:08] simonstewart: and we didn't pay any speakers
[22:39:16] simonstewart: Or fly committers around
[22:39:37] AutomatedTester: and there are NPOs that would gladly give money if we ask
[22:39:44] AutomatedTester: I know of one...
[22:39:50] simonstewart: Heh
[22:40:11] simonstewart: I'll send an email to a group less broad than "selenium-developers" to talk things over
[22:40:21] jleyba: i guess i can't object to it too much
[22:40:28] jimevans: my 2p, i see the need for generating income for the project. i also see the potential for things to get out of hand. i'm not opposed to discrete logos in return for sponsorship money. i think there's a compromise to be made there.
[22:40:34] AutomatedTester: i can see the need for money but I dont want to make our site look awful like https://travis-ci.org which rotates companies that have donated
[22:40:35] jleyba: working for a company that is currently contributing several full time engineers to the project...
[22:41:09] simonstewart: jleyba: there's a section about non-monetary contributions in there :)
[22:41:09] jimevans: right and now i really am off. later.
[22:41:11] jimevans has left #selenium
[22:41:48] simonstewart: Because Google, Mozilla and Sauce (and, I guess SalesForce) all make pretty large contributions
[22:42:14] jleyba: it is possible to list sponsorship in a non-intrusive way: http://nodejs.org/
[22:43:47] simonstewart: OK. Sending an email
[22:43:55] *jleyba hates the java servlet API so damn much
[22:43:57] simonstewart: And glad I didn't hook that into the main site :)
[22:44:02] simonstewart: jleyba: it blows goats
[22:44:51] jleyba: there is so much bloat... trying to write a simple adapter and it's the biggest pain
[22:44:57] simonstewart: Aye
[22:45:03] simonstewart: What have you run into?
[22:45:07] simonstewart: in particular?
[22:45:17] AutomatedTester: jleyba: is that the servlet API or java in general
[22:45:24] *AutomatedTester goes trolling elsewhere now...
[22:45:50] barancev: simonstewart: now can you explain -1 to my prototype
[22:45:51] jleyba: AutomatedTester: java can be a perfectly fine language when you have quality libraries to work with (i.e. guava)
[22:46:09] AutomatedTester: jleyba: I was trolling :)
[22:46:20] simonstewart: barancev: because it means that renaming tests becomes a PITA
[22:46:30] simonstewart: I'd prefer to just use sensible names and more folders
[22:46:53] simonstewart: Coupling test name and page name seems like a deeply fragile thing to do
[22:47:04] barancev: we can either specify a page name in the annotation OR use the defaul one
[22:47:23] simonstewart: If we specify the name in the annotation, then we might as well do "driver.get()"
[22:47:37] barancev: well, yes :)
[22:47:46] simonstewart: And since I'd always want the page to be explicit....
[22:48:33] barancev: I see you point, we just need a Rule
[22:48:54] simonstewart: But the Rule only makes sense if every test in the class uses the same page
[22:49:36] barancev: why? each test method calls driver.get(), and each one uses its own page
[22:49:44] barancev: that's The Rule
[22:50:04] barancev: no page sharing
[22:50:17] simonstewart: Ahh.. not a junit rule
[22:50:21] simonstewart: But a code style rule?
[22:50:29] barancev: yes, code style rule
[22:50:35] simonstewart: Ahhhâ€¦ gotcha
[22:50:44] simonstewart: We can head that way
[22:51:05] o3u has joined #selenium
[22:53:51] barancev: another good rule is to write a test name to the page, so that it can be seen on the screenshots that sauce makes after each step
[22:54:02] simonstewart: Ha!
[22:54:17] simonstewart: This goes back to a conversation I had with Paul Hammant a long time ago
[22:54:27] simonstewart: About to head off to bed, but next time I'm online, ask me about it :)
[22:54:52] barancev: what was the resume of the conversation?
[22:55:02] AutomatedTester: I am going for supper now
[22:55:07] barancev: or it is too long too?
[22:55:10] simonstewart: People who want that sort of thing should implement it in their server
[22:55:12] simonstewart: Sauce has
[22:55:13] AutomatedTester: see you all later!
[22:55:26] simonstewart: But it's trivial to do, so it's not part of the main server
[22:56:20] simonstewart: Email sent.
[22:56:21] simonstewart: Off to bed
[22:56:29] simonstewart: G'night, you lovely people!
