[10:59:33] persepolis: Morning all, I'm writing a little framework in Python: http://codepad.org/3LiphBkP    My problem is this : How can I get information from say, the command line into my BaseSeleniumTest object? Because unittest actually instantiates the BaseSeleniumTest object when it runs, I'm not sure how to get the info in
[10:59:47] persepolis: For instance, passing a flag to decide whether to use Firefox or Chrome
[IRC logfile - Started Wed Sep 12 11:00:08 2012]
[11:00:08] persepolis: And having a conditional in the setUp() method to load chromedriver / Firefox() etc
[11:04:29] mog- has joined #selenium
[11:04:34] persepolis: Probably nobody will read that due to the bot spam, heh
[11:05:43] dawagner: persepolis: What command do you actually want to run?
[11:05:57] dawagner: Something like: python -m unittest mytests --browser=firefox
[11:05:57] dawagner: ?
[11:06:01] andreastt: Wouldn't that just be a case of parsing argv?
[11:06:04] barancev: :ci
[11:06:44] persepolis: I've actually defined cmd args for my program, so: sdtest.py [-h] path
[11:06:52] barancev: where is the bot?
[11:06:54] persepolis: The path argument gets thrown into the testloader
[11:07:25] persepolis: But each Test Case is a class, and I'm not sure how to get args into say, the setUp() method
[11:07:37] andreastt: :ci
[11:07:42] persepolis: Because unittest creates the object in the background

[11:08:05] mog-: Hello, I have a problem with iedriverserver/iedriver where it's hanging in an infinite loop when creating a new browser window. I reported it on http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=4541 - anyone have any advice?
[11:10:25] dawagner: persepolis: An easy way of doing this would be to set environment variables, and read them in setup

[14:00:09] jimevans: in other news, i've successfully integrated wicked-good-xpath into the IE driver. mostly.
[14:00:22] simonstewart: Nicely done
[14:00:54] jimevans: i still have a lingering issue i need to resolve with throwing the right exception when you send valid xpath that doesn't return an element, like "count(//input)"
[14:01:14] simonstewart: What happens?
[14:01:18] ignacio_ has joined #selenium
[14:01:36] alkemist_: jimevans: I'm frequently seeing what looks like a deadlock when the JVM fails to establish a connection with the IEDriverâ€¦
[14:01:48] jimevans: i get a null value back from the atom, which is indistinguishable from the atom not finding the element.
[14:01:49] alkemist_: Is there a way to get it to dump logs/be verbose to try and track this down?
[14:02:15] jimevans: alkemist_: yes, there is. 
[14:02:42] jimevans: at the lowest level it's by starting the IEDriverServer.exe with the right command line args
[14:03:17] alkemist: Right now, it's autostartingâ€¦ i.e. it's just on the PATH.
[14:03:39] alkemist: Can I do this from the driver instantiation?
[14:03:53] jimevans: however, the language bindings usually handle launching the server, and i can't remember what the actual syntax is for Java to change the InternetExplorerDriverService options.
[14:03:55] ignacio__ has joined #selenium
[14:04:29] simonstewart: jimevans: that's less than ideal
[14:04:44] jimevans: there should be some methods off of that object that control it, but like I just don't remember what they are.
[14:04:54] jimevans: simonstewart: indeed.
[14:05:04] alkemist: Can't see anything on http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/ie/InternetExplorerDriver.html
[14:05:26] alkemist: Ahâ€¦ the builder. Found it.
[14:05:47] jimevans: you'll want to set the log file and the log level.
[14:06:19] jimevans: setting the log level to TRACE will generate gobs of information (entry into every method call inside the IE driver)
[14:06:36] alkemist: I'll start with INFO and see what that reveals.
[14:06:49] jimevans: INFO won't give you much. DEBUG would be a better choice.
[14:06:55] alkemist: DEBUG it is.
[14:09:41] jimevans: simonstewart: i toyed with the idea of migrating to injectable atoms, but that's a huge architecture change. right now we do too much in the IE driver in the C++ layer, especially for dealing with element coordinates and such.

[15:48:17] jimevans: i'm going to have to break down and create a set of IE-specific atoms, aren't I?
[15:51:41] Dude-X: why's that?
[15:52:03] Dude-X: because of the way wgxpath handles null and invalid selectors
[15:52:18] jimevans: that's the catalyst, yes.
[15:53:20] jimevans: the real reason is that eventually we want to move to injected atoms, which simplifies stuff on the driver side, but right now, i'm doing a ton of stuff with the C++ COM interfaces for finding element coordinates.
[15:53:31] jimevans: all that needs to be moved into javascript.
[15:54:14] Dude-X: is using COM slower than working within IE?
[15:54:34] simonstewart: jimevans: let me finish this futzing I'm doing
[15:54:42] simonstewart: Then I'll see if I can merge in the wgxpath stuff
[15:55:16] jimevans: no, it's markedly faster, but the caching of already-found elements is a problem in the current IE driver.
[15:55:32] simonstewart: Ah.
[15:55:32] ccooper1 has joined #selenium
[15:55:47] jimevans: we have no way to determine when an already-found element is no longer valid until you try to use it and it's stale.
[15:56:08] jimevans: the injected atoms keep the element cache as a property on the document, so it's garbage collected when the page refreshes.
[15:56:52] jimevans: simonstewart: the merging of the wgxpath isn't the problem. i've got that working great.
[15:57:16] jimevans: except for the single case i mentioned where the valid xpath doesn't return an element.
[15:57:55] simonstewart: k
[15:57:58] *eranm wonders if anybody noticed that 47 of our tests are broken on Firefox 15.0.1, most of them typing-related. simonstewart ? dawagner ?

[15:58:14] simonstewart: I'm merging things
[15:58:35] simonstewart: Raise a bug, and let the wgxpath devs fix things
[15:58:49] jimevans: the bug isn't in wgxpath. it's in the atom.
[15:59:36] simonstewart: Surely if the xpath is ill formed you'd expect an exception?
[15:59:53] jimevans: but the xpath *isn't* ill-formed. it's proper xpath.

[16:03:36] simonstewart: jimevans: what xpathresulttype are you passing in?
[16:04:05] jimevans: looks like FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE.
[16:04:15] jimevans: i'm not modifying the atom at all.
[16:05:26] jimevans: how the hell does this work for firefox or chrome?!?!
[16:05:38] simonstewart: It's a good question
[16:05:53] simonstewart: The wgxpath author asks you to file a bug on google code
[16:05:58] simonstewart: and he'll fix it
[16:06:30] jimevans: i'm not convinced that's where the problem is yet. if it is, i'll file a bug.

[16:18:28] jimevans: let me try something.
[16:20:51] eranm: jimevans, could you have a look at pastebin.com/GnsT8pFm ? Trying to execute a relatively piece of JS code in the IE driver without a lot of luck
[16:21:06] jimevans: no, locator_test.html passes for IE with the wgxpath changes, and it has this test in it, which means bot.locators.findElement() is throwing.
[16:23:34] jimevans: eranm: alright. let me take a look. can you pastebin the change you're making to MouseMoveToCommandHandler.h

[16:26:04] eranm: jimevans, sure
[16:27:03] eranm: jimevans, pastebin.com/V1zZ0AVg
[16:27:47] jimevans: eranm: so your change is localized to synthesized events.
[16:28:00] jimevans: nevermind me. i'm an idiot
[16:28:23] eranm: jimevans, just the opposite
[16:28:26] eranm: on both statements :P
[16:29:03] eranm: What I want to achieve in this change is to check if the element we're  moving to has a text node and if so, hover over the text area rather than in the middle of the element's bounding client rect
[16:29:10] jimevans: yep. got it.
[16:29:11] eranm: The bit of figuring out the text area is not in this change yet
[16:29:45] eranm: (I'll be creating a text range, putting the  element's text in it and using that to figure out the bounding height and width of the text)

[17:37:24] sburjan: Hello. I am using Jenkins and selenium to perform tests on my CI. I am connected using RDP on a slave which runs tests on IE9. the odd thing is that I have no IE9 wnidow. Taking a better look at the proceses, i se it in the background running, but i can't see it on the screen. Does the Internet Explorer Driver standalone executable starts IE in the background ?
[17:38:00] sfbrian has joined #selenium
[17:38:07] jimevans: sburjan: no, it doesn't. furthermore, it can't
[17:38:17] jimevans: start IE as an invisible window.
[17:38:30] jimevans: how many iexplore.exe processes do you have?
[17:39:51] sburjan: jimevans: I see 2 ieprocesses and one IEDriverServer.exe. Both running under the _same_ user as I'm currently logged on. This is what is odd, because I am logged in as the same username
[17:40:20] sburjan: so I should have the IE wnidow on my screen
[17:40:22] jimevans: you should see two iexplore.exe processes. a single instance of IE will spawn two processes.
[17:40:34] sburjan: yes, i see two
[17:40:45] jimevans: are you logged into the same desktop session over RDP?

[17:41:14] sburjan: but it runs fin in the background, i see tests passing in my Jenkins console

[17:44:07] sburjan: I guess that this is more a windows question rather than a selenium one. i was thinking that the IEServer uses some trick, this is why I asked my question here

[17:45:06] mydog2: got a quick xpath question.. i have id="foo1" trying to do a contain(@id,'foo*') kind of thing.. where i say, give me the id that starts with "foo" but has additional chars..
[17:45:21] mydog2: so foo1 would match.. but foo or 1foo wouldn't..

[18:26:41] mydog2: RossPatterson,  - yeah i know... and that will get foo, as well as foo1..  and foo2.. but if i only want foo1 and foo2... than i'd like to be able to do a foo and a wildcard for the remaining chars.. so i'd get  something like =* "foo" .. an di could have sworn i've seen something like this before..
[18:26:56] mydog2: maybe it was the oj..
[18:27:44] RossPatterson: That looks like a CSS pattern match.  XPath does stuff like this using functions, not "wierd" operators.
[18:28:54] RossPatterson: "//*[starts-with(@id, 'foo') and not(@id='foo')]"
[18:29:13] RossPatterson: Unlike "and" and "or", "not" is a function :-)

[20:27:40] lukeis: Archdude: selenium is bad for 'crawling' ... i'd use HtmlUnit or something else (actually, i do use that)
[20:27:52] Archdude: yeah
[20:27:53] Archdude: i 
[20:28:04] Archdude: i guess i could do that then have wd just load pages and take SS
[20:28:56] RossPatterson: There's "crawling" and then there's "crawling".  Selenium does really well at crawling web *applications*, where one has to do more than just follow a link.  wget rocks at crawling web *sites*.
[20:29:30] *RossPatterson used to have a single wget that backed up my entire website.
[20:30:35] *lukeis would not want to code review that ;)

[20:34:29] lukeis: good set of links there :)
[20:35:45] zmorris: ok, I have heard of that pattern from a friend of mine who is working with WD... thanks. I tried using the WebDriverBackedSelenium, but barely any of my tests passed... I think a lot of them were failing because of the waitForPageToLoad commands, but I'm not sure. Again, I'm only about 1 week into WD research.
[20:37:49] lukeis: zmorris: another bit of advice... which has saved me tons of time in maintenance, is use the PageObject pattern and put ALL your selenium calls in the page objects with NONE in your tests
[20:38:11] lukeis: stick to that and you'll find maintenance much easier :)
[20:38:53] stephend: +10 on that
[20:39:02] stephend: we've proven it with at least 13 repos, now :-)
[20:39:08] stephend: some of which have close to 200 tests
[20:39:15] stephend: and we redesign every 6 months or so
[20:39:20] xray701: nice
[20:39:23] xray701: i saw http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/Description/selenium
[20:39:28] stephend: and can fix whole suites in less than 2 weeks
[20:39:30] xray701: that might have some of what you want?
[20:40:12] stephend: zmorris: one sec
[20:40:19] zmorris: thanks... for now, I will focus on learning more about the Page Objects and how those work... but I'm sure I will be in the chat from now until things are working reliably
[20:40:32] lukeis: we're here ;)
[20:41:20] stephend: http://marlenacompton.com/?p=2664
[20:41:31] stephend: a bit outdated, but solid experience/advice
[20:41:41] stephend: we're almost all WB-backed, now

[21:26:11] daveb: Hi there. I am working with the Tcl api which was written for Selenium RC
[21:26:14] daveb: but appears to work
[21:26:31] daveb: I am sending commands such as verifyTextPresent or verifyTextNotPresent
[21:26:38] daveb: which returns either OK
[21:26:41] daveb: or true
[21:26:55] daveb: which seems sort of weird because I am not sure what I am supposed to do with that.
[21:27:16] daveb: and the responses don't seem to correspond to the actual text in the web page.
