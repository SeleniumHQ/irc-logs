[11:29:38] simonstewart: Hi barancev 
[11:29:46] simonstewart: I'm also getting into the act of cleaning up tests :)
[11:30:47] barancev: I have a strange issue with 'go test-rc' -- it does not kill the browser at the end
[11:31:07] simonstewart: ?
[11:31:23] simonstewart: Running it now
[11:31:36] barancev: I'v created a screencast that shows processes during 'go test-rc' run: http://www.screencast.com/t/YNw2FhVtqvD
[11:32:02] barancev: interesting part starts from 0:40
[11:33:21] barancev: when I run SeleniumRcTestSuite from eclipse -- all is ok
[11:33:40] barancev: but when I run 'go test-rc' from the console -- it can't kill the browser
[11:34:46] barancev: (though, I think that from eclipse it runs emulation mode)
[11:34:51] simonstewart: That's odd. I get the opposite
[11:34:55] simonstewart: (which is normally what I want)
[11:35:48] barancev: :gist
[11:35:48] selbot2_: Please paste >3 lines of text to https://gist.github.com
[11:36:12] simonstewart: Just ran it here, and there's no orphan firefox process
[11:36:13] barancev: and the log file contains the following error: https://gist.github.com/3760878
[11:36:23] barancev: (I'm on windows, btw)
[11:37:44] simonstewart: Interesting
[11:37:51] simonstewart: Why have you got a UnixProcess?
[11:37:57] barancev: no idea
[11:38:08] simonstewart: I suspect that's the underlying problem :)
[11:38:24] barancev: dawagner said that 'it has no unix specific code, it's cross-platform'
[11:38:34] simonstewart: Hmmm...
[11:39:12] simonstewart: The idea was that we'd use the WindowsProcessGroup in place of the UnixProcess 
[11:39:56] simonstewart: But I never finished landing the code, as there was some weirdness about process started using that not being to bind ports
[11:40:28] barancev: CommandLine class instantiates UnixProcess no matter what OS you're on
[11:40:51] simonstewart: Like I said, I never finished landing the change
[11:41:08] simonstewart: Because I never tracked down the problems with using the process group in windows
[11:41:18] simonstewart: which would actually be a smarter thing to do
[11:41:25] simonstewart: As it allows us to kill child processes too
[11:41:39] barancev: anybody else on Windows can run RC tests?
[11:41:49] simonstewart: I was one of the few
[11:43:06] barancev: actually, it's just "theoretical issue", no one of my projects uses RC atm, I just wanted to run these tests for sanity check before 2.26
[11:44:03] simonstewart: There's some regressions due to firefox 15
[11:44:23] simonstewart: I get 3 failures, and 2 error
[11:44:24] barancev: in RC?
[11:44:24] simonstewart: s
[11:44:31] simonstewart: In RC
[11:44:46] simonstewart: testKeyPressNative fails
[11:45:02] simonstewart: testSelectWindowTitle, testSelectPopUp also fail, though one of them passes when run alone
[11:45:23] simonstewart: testFramesOpen fails
[11:45:29] simonstewart: testFramesClick fails spectacularly
[11:46:04] simonstewart: Most of those have to do with shenanigans with windows
[11:46:26] simonstewart: The next thing I want to do today is to find the orphan tests
[11:47:13] simonstewart: I just found some more which need to be wired back in
[11:47:14] simonstewart: *sigh*

[11:49:03] barancev: I'd say we have to spend more effort on webdriverbackedselenium to replace rc as soon as possible
[11:50:23] simonstewart: Or not. The wdbs is meant as a bridge
[11:51:54] simonstewart: So people can chose to migrate in a managed way
[11:52:06] simonstewart: We've got pretty good compatibility as it is
[11:52:20] simonstewart: (if my experience at google tells me anything)
[11:52:58] barancev: my experience of several migrations says that wdbs is close to useless
[11:53:14] simonstewart: Ha!
[11:53:20] simonstewart: Where's it breaking for you?
[11:53:42] adamgoucher: from what i've seen in the wild, the easiest way to convert rc scripts is typically to page-object-ify your scripts, clone the tree in <whatever> and then start rip-and-replacing one backend for another
[11:53:49] barancev: you get no bonuses switching from defaultselenium to wdbs
[11:54:09] simonstewart: Other than the ability to migrate things over a class at a time
[11:54:36] simonstewart: The idea is that you have a large suite of existing tests, 
[11:54:42] simonstewart: hopefully using page objects and all the good stuff
[11:55:05] simonstewart: You substitute in the wdbs and clean things up just enough to allow your existing tests to continue working
[11:55:18] simonstewart: Then, as you touch an area of the code, you can migrate it to webdriver
[11:55:56] barancev: yes, if your test architecture is really good, test code separated from the "selenium layer" etc
[11:56:13] simonstewart: Even if it's not, you can migrate a class at a time
[11:57:34] simonstewart: But, yes, if you've got poorly structured code things are going to be less effective
[11:58:25] barancev: that's why I said we have to spend more effort to support all the RC interface in wdbs
[11:58:51] barancev: atm you can't just replace one with another, you've to rework code anyway
[11:59:04] simonstewart: Which methods are missing?
[11:59:41] barancev: frame manipulation, from the top of my head
[IRC logfile - Started Fri Sep 21 12:00:03 2012]
[12:00:03] simonstewart: I thought those were there.
[12:00:08] *simonstewart heads off to read code
[12:00:28] barancev: there is, bot you can't switch to "parent frame", for example
[12:00:39] barancev: s/bot/but/
[12:00:57] simonstewart: Well that's a quick fix in the Windows class
[12:01:12] barancev: getwindowhandles is absent from wdbs, iirc
[12:02:06] simonstewart: That's true: I never could get the browser to give me a proper list
[12:02:24] simonstewart: I suspect we need to make some changes in Core to expose the list in a way we can use
[12:03:19] barancev: and, of course, you can see that WebDriverSeleniumTestSuite is about twice shorter than SeleniumRcTestSuite
[12:03:57] simonstewart: True. 
[12:04:06] simonstewart: You're welcome to help change that :)
[12:04:15] simonstewart: I implemented what I needed for a pretty large code base
[12:04:37] barancev: well, I'd kill RC and wdbs both at once ;)
[12:04:59] simonstewart: You're not alone in that view
[12:05:24] barancev: or, separate them from the main distro
[12:05:58] simonstewart: I always thought we'd call it "selenium-leg-rc:
[12:06:05] simonstewart: Which is bad, bad joke
[12:06:09] barancev: it'd be a signal to the users: we're not going to evolve this part
[12:07:05] barancev: and close all the issues with a resolution like "sorry, rc closed"
[12:07:09] simonstewart: You don't think that we're already sending that signal?
[12:07:50] simonstewart: I note with interest that Firefox reports the title of a window differently in Firefox 15 than in Firefox 10
[12:08:12] barancev: lets strip rc from selenium-server-standalone.jar
[12:08:54] simonstewart: Not yet
[12:09:02] simonstewart: We'll get there
[12:09:14] simonstewart: We do that when we flip the major version number to 3
[12:09:32] simonstewart: And we do _that_ once we get the safari driver released as a proper extension 
[12:09:53] barancev: ok, good roadmap, I agree
[12:09:54] simonstewart: and we do _that_ once apple finish the conversation about what developer programme we should be on
[12:10:06] simonstewart: :)
[12:10:08] simonstewart: Thanks
[12:10:12] barancev: and replace htmlunit with ghostdriver, I hope
[12:10:52] simonstewart: I'm indifferent
[12:11:00] barancev: because htmlunit's js engine is quite pure
[12:11:18] simonstewart: The nice thing with htmlunit is that it's pure java

[12:42:04] RossPatterson: Just read your WD vs. WDBS email.
[12:42:19] simonstewart: Make sense?
[12:42:22] RossPatterson: Yup
[12:42:30] simonstewart: Or do I really need to go grab that coffee?
[12:42:34] simonstewart: Ok. That's good :)
[12:44:01] RossPatterson: But it left me wondering about how it jives with a comment you made a few days back that you originally conceived of WebDriver as a lower-level API to be hidden from users.  And WDBS seems like one of those user-facing APIs.  So how come it's not loved?
[12:44:17] RossPatterson: Other than personal bias, of course.  My bias is pro-RC-API :-)
[12:44:29] simonstewart: Because I view RC and WebDriver as living at the same level of the stack
[12:44:49] RossPatterson: You see stuff like Capybara as the higher level?
[12:45:19] simonstewart: I always thought that the next level would be abstractions built by people for their own apps
[12:45:35] simonstewart: Capybara seems to exist somewhere between those two levels
[12:46:50] RossPatterson: Have you seen any examples of this utopian system?
[12:47:20] simonstewart: Where people write their own support classes and sensible abstractions? Sure
[12:47:38] simonstewart: You can see it all the time when you look at (good) Page Object implementations
[12:47:48] RossPatterson: That's what I suspected.
[12:48:26] simonstewart: But Page Objects are just one manifestation of that
[12:48:44] admc has joined #selenium
[12:48:47] simonstewart: You could implement some sort of actor-based scheme
[12:49:00] simonstewart: Where you model the individuals interacting with your system
[12:49:02] james_o has joined #selenium
[12:49:14] simonstewart: It's even harder to explain and get right than Page Objects, though :)
[12:49:28] RossPatterson: We're in transition from click-type-select-blah-blah-blah code to POs ourselves, and while it's hard, the tests look much more life-like.  But POs in C# (and probably Java for the same reasons) look fugly.  I'm thinking of driving us towards Python for the beauty factor.
[12:49:59] simonstewart: Beauty is a fine thing to strive for
[12:50:03] RossPatterson: Yeah, CS has been trying to get practicing programmers to grok Actors for a long time :-)
[12:50:50] simonstewart: Hmph! Something has definitely changed in the way that Firefox handles windows and frames between firefox 10 and 15
[12:51:27] RossPatterson: ¡Gracias!
[12:51:42] RossPatterson: Uh.  Marionette can't come soon enough :-)
[12:51:56] simonstewart: Well, this is a break in RC

[16:29:21] detronizator: jimevans: ok
[16:29:57] detronizator: jimevans: unfortunately I do see that something is wring in phantomjs and causing those crashes
[16:30:43] jimevans: I guessed that was the case. Nevertheless, I feel like we're making great progress. 
[16:31:38] jimevans: We are going to hit the wall of what's possible with the atoms soon, which is good.
[16:33:07] jimevans: detronizator: Two things: first, what's the state of the window switching API? Should it work completely in your estimation?
[16:33:43] detronizator: I think it should. I don't recall anything missing.

[21:28:09] dawagner: Awesome :)
[21:28:19] dawagner: One thing to check: If a CSS color property is actually upper case
[21:28:25] dawagner: i.e. style="color: RED"
[21:28:28] dawagner: What happens?
[21:29:05] Ardesco_H: the colour you supply is uppercased to match the enum anyway
[21:29:15] Ardesco_H: so shouldn't make any difference
[21:29:37] dawagner: I've just checked in a page, it works :)
[21:29:38] Ardesco_H: Colors.valueOf(value.toUpperCase()).getColorValue()
[21:29:51] Ardesco_H: will throw an exception if you supply an invalid colour
[21:29:52] dawagner: My question was whether toUpperCase was destroying information
[21:29:53] dawagner: Which it's not :)
[21:29:56] Ardesco_H: but I fugured that was fair game
[21:30:03] Ardesco_H: *figured
[21:30:22] dawagner: Why did shorts become ints?
[21:30:56] Ardesco_H: because short is the same as an int in java and there isn't a way to do a lazt initialisation of a short
[21:31:04] Ardesco_H: lazy
[21:31:30] dawagner: Awesomesauce! :)
[21:31:37] Ardesco_H: so 12d would denote a double, but you can't do something like 12s
[21:32:12] Ardesco_H: (my understanding is that short os a throwback to C syntax)
[21:32:17] Ardesco_H: *is
[21:32:22] Ardesco_H: can't type tonight
[21:34:18] dawagner: Yeah :)
[21:34:33] Ardesco_H: also made the constructor public partly for ease and partly because it lets you just define a colour object without having to convert from a string
[21:35:47] dawagner: Would package-private do?
[21:36:10] Ardesco_H: i haven't seen package-private before so no idea :)
[21:36:24] dawagner: What's the deal with the BaseColorConverter?
[21:36:45] Ardesco_H: oh is that protected
[21:36:45] dawagner: If you don't list any protection level (public, private, protected), it's package-private, which means only things in the same package can call it
[21:36:54] Ardesco_H: in that case yeah protected should do i guess

[22:57:23] KaibutsuX: anyone still around know why my Chrome Options aren't getting passed on to the chromedriver?
[22:59:14] DarkRift: someone know of a good library for image comparison in java ?
[22:59:36] DarkRift: need to compare screenshots from different browsers and see where they differ without doing that manually

[22:59:52] KaibutsuX: I have one in Python, thats what we use, sorry, no java

[23:01:07] KaibutsuX: apparently the ChromeOptions are passed on to webdriver, NOT on to Chrome.Service
[23:01:08] KaibutsuX: thats blows
[23:06:12] DarkRift: KaibutsuX, what's the name of that lib ? Java is only a high preference, but could probably get away with another language
[23:06:54] KaibutsuX: I use PIL
[23:06:58] KaibutsuX: python imaging library
[23:07:17] DarkRift: ty
[23:07:29] KaibutsuX: np, you'll want ImageChops and ImageOps out of it

[23:17:01] Dude-X: there's ImageMagick for Java
[23:17:29] DarkRift: yea, but it's only a JNI/JNA wrapper in front of the image magick library
[23:18:38] DarkRift: when I'll try to deploy that to jenkins, I'd have to limit the build to something that has the image magick library installed, thus why I'm looking more into pure java stuff ,but it is a solution indeed
[23:18:43] Dude-X: there's a library out that does image hashing
[23:18:53] Dude-X: i see
[23:19:50] DarkRift: thanks for the hint tho, got to go, bus arrived at my destination
[23:22:27] KaibutsuX: freaking Chromedriver is crashing like it's its job
[23:24:40] KaibutsuX: haha!
[23:25:45] KaibutsuX: I've been running Chrome via a Windows VM which has the repo containing chromedriver mounted as a network drive (z:). Fucker would crash like 20 times in a row and then randomly start working again for a few days. I copy the directory locally (c:) and it starts right up
[23:26:21] KaibutsuX: we'll see if it stays that way
