[09:18:13] andreastt: barancev: So this only happens with a remote driver?
[09:18:52] andreastt: By the way, it's meant to open opera:debug every time.  We force that because it's a scriptinjectable page that is safe for OperaDriver to start on.
[09:18:52] barancev: andreastt: with local one too
[09:19:05] andreastt: I'm guessing what happens is that Opera is not able to connect to OperaDriver.
[09:19:26] andreastt: It happanes consistently with that TC?
[09:19:33] andreastt: happens, also.
[09:19:38] barancev: yes, it opens opera_debug, but sometimes it sticks to this page and don't want to go further
[09:22:17] barancev: andreastt: it can happen with the simplest scenario: OperaDriver driver = new OperaDriver(); driver.get("http://localhost/");
[09:22:21] AutomatedTester: andreastt: oh...
[09:22:51] barancev: andreastt: but usually it happens only once, on the first run

[11:32:31] laurczak: AutomatedTester: thanks I tried this function but was not able to identify which window is which as function returns a list with UUIDs and not 'human readable names'. I know what is the name of my popup so I will just use it with driver.switch_to_window. I had an isue probably because after first driver.get(URL) I have to add time.sleep to wait till javascript is executed and popup created
[11:33:15] AutomatedTester: laurczak: if you know the name of the window then you can move to it
[11:34:22] AutomatedTester: laurczak: if you have target='name of window' then you can
[11:34:33] AutomatedTester: in your html
[11:34:47] AutomatedTester: otherwise webdriver has no way of know what window you mean
[11:35:05] AutomatedTester: and you just have to get all the window handles and iterate till you find the one you want
[11:35:57] laurczak: AutomatedTester: understood, so iteration is probably better than using wait command with X sleep seconds parameter
[11:37:44] AutomatedTester: well I wouldnt recommend a sleep unless it is in a loop to see if something is there

[12:19:38] jimevans: i'm wondering if there's any mileage in just speaking to the debugging protocol directly via the language bindings instead of sticking an http translator in between, especially if the json formats are similar.

[12:21:51] jimevans: nice
[12:21:55] jimevans: we've already set the precedent that http is not necessarily a required transport for the json wire protocol (c.f. SafariDriver and OperaDriver).

[12:26:17] selbot2: 1: 03JsonWireProtocol: A description of the protocol used by WebDriver to communicate with remote instances - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol
[12:27:09] jimevans: andreastt: no worries, mate. i was just kidding around about protobufs, and the operadriver's java-only implementation.
[12:27:10] jimevans: :)
[12:27:17] andreastt: When we started creating OperaDriver we initially planned on using XML (this was back in 2008), but we found it too heavyweight.
[12:27:57] andreastt: Obviously we haven't done any speed comparisons on JSON vs protobuffers, but I'd imagine them both to be quite fast, but with protobufs leading the race.
[12:28:11] jimevans: that would be my expectation too.
[12:29:03] andreastt: Regrading the HTTP translator, I believe we decided on not spec'ing the transport method for obvious reasons.
[12:29:41] andreastt: We sort of have an HTTP translator in the Selenium project, though.  As a part of the remote driver.
[12:29:59] andreastt: Only difference is that it calls down to an internal Java class instead of forwarding by HTTP/JSON.
[12:33:01] jimevans: right. the architecture is there in the .net bindings to use another transport protocol instead of http.
[12:33:24] jimevans: i just need to get off my lazy ass and implement the opera driver protobufs in .net. :)
[12:33:41] jimevans: which means it's probably not going to happen in the near future.

[12:35:26] jimevans: oh sure we can.
[12:35:35] jimevans: and that's the path for people to use now
[12:35:41] jimevans: for opera via .net bindings
[12:35:58] jimevans: but that involves the java runtime.
[12:36:21] jimevans: which i'd like to at least provide an option for users to avoid if they want to.
[12:38:10] jimevans: it's a silly goal, and probably more trouble than it's worth in the long run, but i've always had a little bit of don quixote in me. :)
[12:39:31] andreastt: There is a lot more to the OperaDriver than Scope, though.
[12:39:52] jimevans: yes, as we've discussed.
[12:39:55] andreastt: If you take a look at the code there are actually quite few things we do through Scope.
[12:40:02] andreastt: Scope is very, very spartan.
[12:40:09] andreastt: Moreso than WebDriver.
[12:41:31] jimevans: i've been thinking that i might take a look at the java-to-c# mechanical translation tool that ximian came up with when they cloned android.
[12:41:56] andreastt: If your idea is like getting rid of Java altogether, that's not going to happen really.  I mean, it wouldn't help even if we had a built-in HTTP translator in OperaDriver, which would make the OperaDriver behave pretty much like ChromeDriver.
[12:41:57] jimevans: just to see what it comes up with, mind.
[12:43:37] jimevans: andreastt: i'm not sure i fully agree. couldn't i completely reimplement the entirety of OperaDriver in a not-Java language?

[12:44:38] andreastt: It's like 20k SoC.
[12:45:39] jimevans: since seconf, i've become less enthusiastic about http as the transport piece for the json wire protocol

[12:46:28] andreastt: s/SoC/SLoC
[12:48:02] jimevans: as convenient as it would be to have one true transport mechanism for all webdriver communications, i see the merit in other approaches.
[12:48:58] jimevans: websockets for safari being a prime example, scope for opera being another, and the forthcoming remote debugging protocol for firefox being yet another.
[12:50:22] jimevans: and i realize i'm oversimplifying matters a rather large bit, but it's friday, so i'm going to take that liberty. :)
[12:53:52] andreastt: barancev: I suspect the bug we talked about earlier is an Opera bug and not in OperaDriver.
[12:54:17] andreastt: barancev: Question is if we should handle it better in OperaDriver, of course‚Ä¶ Not sure we can with the INI library we're using, but I'll investigate.

[21:09:34] lukeis: greggawatt: what's the issue? grid doesn't run things in parallel your test runner does (for java jUnit or TestNG do the parallel execution)
[21:10:11] lukeis: genecyber: have a stacktrace or test case you can show us that isn't working? also are you using the same versions of the browsers remotely and locally?
[21:10:37] genecyber: yes

In these situations, wait for the tab to reload and then send the command again. | https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/detail?r=16961 | http://seleniumhq.org/ci.jsp?r=16961
