[14:21:22] simonstewart: Let's try that again
[14:21:59] kallisti: what base64 encoding standard does selenium use?
[14:22:09] simonstewart: umm... 
[14:22:16] simonstewart: _the_ base64 encoding standard?
[14:22:27] kallisti: there are two.
[14:22:29] nirvdrum: simonstewart: I'm way late to the game on this, but why does new session creation return a 303 instead of a 201 with a Location header?  Was there some technical reason or just a preference?
[14:22:33] simonstewart: Are there?
[14:22:39] simonstewart: Interesting. Never knew that :)
[14:23:22] ian_mac has joined #selenium
[14:24:00] simonstewart: No particular technical reason
[14:24:05] kallisti: I'm guessing that it's the MIME stadard.
[14:24:16] kallisti: as that would explain why my base64 lib isn't working properly.
[14:24:26] simonstewart: Though I like the requirement that a 303 MUST NOT be cached
[14:25:01] llaskin: anyone wiling to give me an idea on wtf is wrong with my code?
[14:25:10] kallisti: I think the lib I'm usingly strictly conforms to RFC 4648.
[14:25:28] llaskin: this unknown error is seriously putting a crimp in my style...
[14:25:28] simonstewart: We use the base64 encoder from the xstream project
[14:25:46] simonstewart: llaskin: I suspect that the problem is that there's some sort of failure?
[14:26:11] kallisti: is that where the decoder is from as well?
[14:26:19] simonstewart: (it's just possible, I'm missing some context, llaskin)
[14:26:22] simonstewart: kallisti: yes
[14:26:38] krosenvold: nirvdrum: my phone is on irc
[14:26:39] simonstewart: I spoke to Joe Walnes and got permission to reuse it in selenium
[14:26:41] llaskin: $browser.execute_script("arguments[0].getElementsByTagName('*')",$browser.find_element(:css, ".advanced-variables .expander-body")).nil?   why might this throw an "unknown error" in the javascript?
[14:26:47] simonstewart: krosenvold: and you're on your phone
[14:27:00] simonstewart: llaskin: you need the "return" keyword in there
[14:27:19] nirvdrum: krosenvold: Ping me when you have some time and it's safe :-)
[14:27:20] simonstewart: and you appear to be mixing quoting styles
[14:27:37] simonstewart: (presumably you're escaping one of those types of quotes properly)
[14:27:45] kallisti: it looks like Python's base64 lib uses RFC 3548.
[14:27:58] kallisti: so I'll just implement that and see what happens.
[14:28:35] llaskin: tried that
[14:29:06] simonstewart: does that find_element actually return anything?
[14:29:09] llaskin: when i did "return arguments[0].getElementsByTagName('*')" it still fails
[14:29:10] llaskin: yes it does
[14:29:15] llaskin: an element.
[14:29:24] llaskin: i'm just checking if there are any children of the element
[14:29:28] simonstewart: :)
[14:30:03] llaskin: and i've had it work in IRB with/without the return...
[14:30:07] simonstewart: ok
[14:30:24] simonstewart: though that's probably returning whether the JS was able to be evaluated....
[14:30:35] llaskin: nah it returned nil 
[14:30:39] llaskin: which is what i was expecting...
[14:30:45] kallisti: if it were just that selenium uses the MIME "standard" then I could just insert line-breaks every 76 characters
[14:30:46] simonstewart: Ah!
[14:30:50] simonstewart: Brain-wave
[14:30:58] simonstewart: It's probably returning a node list
[14:31:08] llaskin: there are *NO* children of that element
[14:31:10] simonstewart: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.getElementsByTagName
[14:31:15] llaskin: the goal is to have it return nil...
[14:31:19] llaskin: and it does in IRB
[14:31:26] simonstewart: Though the docs say that it may be returning an HTMLCollection
[14:31:37] llaskin: If no elements were found, the NodeList is empty.
[14:31:40] simonstewart: It's possible that we're not handling the conversion of that to an array of elements properly
[14:31:52] llaskin: so it will return null/nil won't it?
[14:31:52] simonstewart: Yes, but here's the point, it's a NodeList, _not_ an array
[14:31:58] simonstewart: It may detonate
[14:32:02] llaskin: nil is nil....
[14:32:09] simonstewart: nil is not nil in this case.
[14:32:13] simonstewart: It's an empty nodelist
[14:32:14] llaskin: but i don't get why it works in IRB, but not in my code....
[14:32:19] simonstewart: which is a falsey value
[14:32:20] llaskin: is where i'm having the real issue...
[14:32:22] simonstewart: Probably
[14:32:41] simonstewart: Anyway, that's my theory
[14:32:58] simonstewart: What happens if you return the coerced boolean value?
[14:33:08] llaskin: sorry you've just gone over my head
[14:33:09] simonstewart: Or the numerical size of the list from your JS?
[14:33:10] llaskin: coerced?
[14:33:17] simonstewart: !!value 
[14:33:27] llaskin: lemme check one min
[14:34:08] simonstewart: It forces "value" to be evaluated as a truthy/falsey, which returns a boolean. We then return the "not" of that boolean value. 
[14:34:27] simonstewart: That means that if we have a "falsey" value, we return a proper boolean false
[14:34:35] simonstewart: And the opposite for "truthy" values
[14:35:21] llaskin: ok
[14:35:25] llaskin: gimme a min to load the page
[14:35:26] kallisti: are we talking abour Ruby?
[14:35:26] llaskin: will know in a sec
[14:35:29] llaskin: yes we are
[14:35:58] simonstewart: In JS? undefined definitely is too
[14:36:34] simonstewart: And a quick look in the error console suggests that an empty array is false too
[14:37:14] kallisti: we must be talking about different things then.
[14:37:17] simonstewart: Ohh... an empty nodelist is "true"
[14:37:20] kallisti: !![] is true in Ruby.
[14:37:37] simonstewart: Heh.
[14:37:41] simonstewart: True in JS too
[14:37:44] simonstewart: But 
[14:37:48] simonstewart: [] == false
[14:38:00] llaskin: no
[14:38:03] simonstewart: Very weird
[14:38:06] llaskin: ![] = false
[14:38:15] llaskin: so [] = true
[14:38:23] llaskin: or so one would assume....
[14:38:31] kallisti: to my knowledge, the only values in Ruby that are false are false and nil.
[14:38:35] AutomatedTester: jarib: you there?
[14:38:37] kallisti: everything else is true.
[14:38:39] simonstewart: llaskin: I'm evaluating statements in V8 as we type :)
[14:38:46] simonstewart: kallisti: I'm talking about JS
[14:38:50] kallisti: ah okay
[14:39:30] llaskin: sorry it takes a while to get to the test condition

[14:43:32] llaskin: on the EXACT same page as it would run in during my test run
[14:43:51] llaskin: but when run during the test run it spits back an unknown error
[14:43:52] simonstewart: But that _should_ be returning nil
[14:43:59] simonstewart: Because you have no return statement in your JS

[14:45:17] llaskin: so an empty node list right?
[14:45:37] kallisti: looks like it
[14:45:47] simonstewart: Try to evaluate 'argument[0].getElementsByTagName("*").length == 0'
[14:45:52] kallisti: does * count as a valid tag name?
[14:45:54] simonstewart: right
[14:45:59] simonstewart: It's special cased
[14:46:04] simonstewart: To mean "any tag"
[14:46:04] kallisti: I see.
[14:46:16] llaskin: .length does return 0
[14:46:18] llaskin: ok

[14:46:40] simonstewart: Right
[14:47:21] kallisti: oh. apparently the difference
[14:47:34] kallisti: is that Python's encodestring method includes a trailing newline.
[14:47:41] kallisti: I bet it's MIME encoded actually.
[14:47:50] kallisti: it says "one or more lines of base64-encoded data" so yeah.
[14:49:13] kallisti: okay that's an easy fix.

[15:33:21] davehunt: but we've not had a lot of time to work on it recently
[15:33:43] davehunt: barancev: why do you ask? noticed a nasty bug we need to fix?
[15:34:37] barancev: I'm not sure about IDE/Core, but -- #3861
[15:34:38] selbot2: 03 open/accepted Selenium IDE. Command TypeKeys does not work in FF 12.0 - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3861 [Type-Defect Priority-Medium Component-Core]
[15:35:01] davehunt: hmm.. I was part way through a fix for that iirc
[15:35:19] barancev: nice!
[15:35:45] davehunt: it's relatively simple to fix, but the code is all over the place :/
[15:36:57] kallisti: jimevans: when you send the firefox profile as part of the desired capabilities, is it wrapped in a JSON object or is it just a string?
[15:37:31] barancev: davehunt: it would be nice to have it on the roadmap, it's blocking issue for IDE in FF12
[15:37:32] kallisti: in the Ruby bindings I noticed that it seems to do something like {:zip => "base64 string"}
[15:37:45] kallisti: but the desiredcapabilities documentation says it should just be a string
[15:38:43] jimevans: please hold, caller
[15:40:13] barancev: jimevans: what do you think about this review by simonstewart: r16952 ?

[15:40:32] barancev: do we have a chance to make it browser-agnostic?
[15:41:04] jimevans: please hold, caller
[15:41:49] davehunt: barancev: I'm not sure it'll get in the next version, but we'll do our best. We can always do a subsequent release
[15:42:07] jimevans: kallisti: okay. the .net bindings shove the base64 encoded profile as a string. it doesn't rewrap it into another json object.
[15:43:05] kallisti: good to know.
[15:44:19] jimevans: barancev: i understand simonstewart's discomfort. the question is, does any other browser throw up a "a script is trying to close this window" alert? i don't know the answer to that question, but it directly informs the test behaviour
[15:44:47] barancev: o, other browsers don't have this alert
[15:44:55] jimevans: if the answer is, "yes, other browsers throw up this kind of dialog too", then yes, we can make that change browser-agnostic.
[15:45:01] jimevans: or we should be able to.
[15:45:25] barancev: it's IE only
[15:45:40] jimevans: if the answer is "no, IE is the only browser to act that way", then we have to ask a different question, which is, "how important is this particular test to IE?"
[15:45:45] barancev: (I'm not sure about Safari, though)
[15:47:01] barancev: it's important to anybody who is working with multi-window application -- he should write special code for IE
[15:47:49] barancev: it's good we have this workaroung for the alert, but...
[15:48:44] jimevans: but what? we can't change the browser's behavior.
[15:48:51] jimevans: (much as i'd like to)
[15:49:14] barancev: we can automatically check for the alert after 'close' command
[15:49:41] barancev: (just an idea :))
[15:50:01] nitin has joined #selenium
[15:50:18] jimevans: so you're proposing to introduce an automatic, hard-coded wait after every single attempt to call driver.close() for IE?
[15:50:34] jimevans: because that's exactly what it would mean.
[15:50:56] barancev: yes, it sounds so
[15:51:18] jimevans: and it's a static wait, which would wait until the full timeout in the common case.
[15:51:27] kallisti: damn you firefox, accept my profile zip.
[15:51:35] jfunk has joined #selenium
[15:52:31] jimevans: barancev: and the case where the problem occurs isn't driver.close(), it's element.click() where the element in question calls window.close() in javascript.
[15:52:54] barancev: jimevans: yes, you are right...
[15:53:06] jimevans: so now you'd have to introduce a hard-coded, static wait after every element click. no, i don't think we'll be doing that. :)
[15:53:16] kallisti: something else must be wrong here. I'm pretty sure I'm doing exactly what the Python lib does now.
[15:53:43] barancev: so, we'll have to live with browser-specific code here

[16:17:42] llaskin: the wierd part, that executes JUST FINE in IRB
[16:17:47] kallisti: "unknown error" isn't very helpful. Is there more info anywhere (perhaps in the selenium server log?)
[16:17:50] llaskin: its just when running through my script that it causes an unkown error
[16:17:53] llaskin: yes there is
[16:17:53] llaskin: one sec
[16:18:14] kallisti: llaskin: it sounds to me like there's some context that's different then.
[16:18:39] llaskin: https://gist.github.com/2762874
[16:18:48] llaskin: hrm....i don't think there is
[16:19:12] llaskin: it shoudl either return an empty nodelist, or a node list with nodes....
[16:19:16] kallisti: oh it's failing in an assert in the response code.
[16:19:18] llaskin: i'm expecting an empty list....
[16:19:37] AutomatedTester: the IEDriver tests for python make me sad
[16:19:40] kallisti: er, shouldn't it return 0?
[16:19:52] kallisti: or whatever the length is?
[16:20:38] llaskin: yes
[16:20:47] llaskin: thats what i meant to say.
[16:21:07] jimevans: AutomatedTester: why's that? because they fail, or because they're incomplete?
[16:21:42] AutomatedTester: jimevans: because my windows environment is slow
[16:21:58] jimevans: ah. well that's a different kettle of fish altogether. :)
[16:22:44] AutomatedTester: but I can't remember where i was so running my tests quickly to see whats broken
[16:22:52] kallisti: llaskin: so it's returning nil
[16:23:05] kallisti: aka "could be literally anything in the javascript code itself"
[16:23:15] llaskin: ummm
[16:23:21] llaskin: its not returning anything from what I can see....
[16:23:28] kallisti: assert_ok is checking for nil
[16:23:31] llaskin: aaah ok
[16:23:37] kallisti: oh wait
[16:23:38] llaskin: and if its nil, throws an "unknown error"?
[16:23:41] kallisti: no that's the response code
[16:23:43] kallisti: nevermind
[16:23:58] kallisti: you should run standalone and get a backtrace from the server itself.
[16:24:24] llaskin: i've never bothered to setup the standalone stuff
[16:24:27] kallisti: it's checking the code of the HTTP response
[16:24:30] llaskin: probably cna't till 6/1 tbh...
[16:24:34] kallisti: if it's nil or 400 then it throws an error.
[16:24:39] llaskin: i actually have a copy of the HTML that is on the server at that point
[16:24:40] kallisti: er >= 400
[16:24:51] llaskin: and I know that it should be returning 0...
[16:26:15] kallisti: it's something happening serverside. so to figure out what it is you'd need to get the stacktrace on the server side.
[16:27:05] llaskin: so i need to be running selenium on the webserver?
[16:27:16] stockton has joined #selenium
[16:27:27] kallisti: you need to be running selenium wherever your program is running
[16:27:33] kallisti: or otherwise configure it a different way
[16:27:46] kallisti: by default it binds to localhost:4444
[16:29:59] kallisti: and whatever "remote" class in the Ruby bindings will probably connect to that by default
[16:30:03] kallisti: but you can configure it otherwise.
[16:30:35] kallisti: actually
[16:30:44] kallisti: you may be able to extract the stacktrace from the error.
[16:32:05] kallisti: the wire protocol sends a copy of the server-side stacktrace, but I don't know if any of the standard bindings actually store it anywhere.
[16:32:18] kallisti: I print it out as part of my errors.
[16:32:40] kallisti: because there's a lot of stuff that gives very non-helpful error messages and a server-side stacktrace  is useful for debugging.
[16:33:02] llaskin: will have to look into that post 6/1
[16:33:07] llaskin: right now i'll just try/catch it i guess
[16:33:17] webben: What Maven artifact is org/openqa/selenium/browserlaunchers/AsyncExecute packaged in?
[16:33:47] kallisti: llaskin: do you know where all the exception types are located in the ruby bindings?
[16:33:50] kallisti: I can't find them
[16:33:53] kallisti: ah common.error
[16:34:28] kallisti: yeah it doesn't look like it stores the stacktrace info.
[16:35:24] webben: shouldn't this pom.xml just work?
[16:35:26] webben:  http://pastie.org/3945234
[16:35:53] kallisti: llaskin: is StandardError a standard Ruby class?

[16:44:36] simonstewart: BTW, was thinking of contacting Telerik and seeing if we can get webdriver hooks built into their web components
[16:44:47] simonstewart: How awesome would that be?
[16:45:17] Dude-X: what project is telerik involved in? 
[16:45:37] simonstewart: Telerik make components used by loads of projects
[16:45:50] simonstewart: Think of them as a commercial ExtJS and you're on the right track

[16:46:15] simonstewart: http://www.telerik.com/
[16:46:35] simonstewart: The next barrier for the project after standardization is support from UI vendors
[16:46:46] simonstewart: Writing a web test using selenium should be easy

[16:48:16] simonstewart: It can only ever be that way if we have support from the apps under test

[16:49:00] simonstewart: I'm thinking lower level
[16:49:14] llaskin: kallisti yes, though i require(they are mostly analogous)
[16:49:19] simonstewart: Products from the likes of Telerik provide UI components
[16:49:32] simonstewart: It'd be fantastic if they also provided web testing components for those
[16:49:38] simonstewart: And the two played nicely with each other

[16:52:35] simonstewart: Me too. So let's start targetting
[16:52:40] simonstewart: and pushing
[16:53:55] jimevans: sencha is one i'd love to see that for, even though i don't use their components anymore.
[16:54:44] simonstewart: ExtJS?
[16:54:46] webben: nvm I think my Chrome Driver Selenium version is wrong
[16:54:59] webben: looks like should match my selenium version
[16:55:05] simonstewart: GWT too
[16:55:17] simonstewart: Might start feeding the GWT team patches too
[16:55:37] jimevans: simonstewart: yeah, i was thinking specifically of extjs.
[16:55:39] iamjarvo: is there a way i can check if the selenium-webdriver gem is starting the seenium server

[16:56:13] simonstewart: jimevans: k
[16:56:28] simonstewart: wondering how we want people to expose the ability to integrate with their frameworks
[16:56:36] simonstewart: Perhaps we should put together some guidelines
[16:56:59] simonstewart: I can implement them for GWT (or at least point the GWT team in that direction)
[16:57:15] simonstewart: and then we can write patches for ExtJS
[16:57:21] simonstewart: And drag Telerik in too

[17:03:02] jimevans: indeed, though it's pretty simple to translate WebDriver code from language A to language B. 
[17:03:12] simonstewart: once it's written
[17:03:23] simonstewart: And, more importantly, once the hooks are in the UI framework
[17:03:25] tessarakt2 has joined #selenium
[17:03:34] simonstewart: Though I'd love a common standard between everything
[17:03:53] simonstewart: Especially if they mix and match
[17:04:10] simonstewart: And so have more than one UI framework in play
[17:06:23] kallisti: ah my problem had nothing to do with base64 encoding, of course.
[17:06:37] jimevans: right. i wonder how much cooperation we'd be able to expect among vendors though.
[17:06:56] jimevans: i'd just be happy to have a "vendor-approved" API for testing using webdriver.
[17:07:09] jimevans: but standardization does have a lot more appeal.
[17:07:23] simonstewart: Vendor approved is the first step
[17:07:37] simonstewart: I can easily talk to the GWT and Closure test teams
[17:07:51] simonstewart: There are great people at Telerik
[17:08:00] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[17:08:07] simonstewart: Once there's code out there, ExtJS and JQuery might be easier to persuade
[17:08:30] jimevans: true that.
[17:08:32] simonstewart: I'd love a couple of simple things
[17:08:44] simonstewart: 1) a way of letting users know that an app is ready for interactions
[17:08:56] simonstewart: 2) a way of letting users know that a specific action is complete
[17:09:04] AutomatedTester: sorry for joining the conversation late but is this about vendors offering PO for their widgets?
[17:09:04] simonstewart: 3) Wrappers around provided UI components
[17:09:13] simonstewart: "PO"?
[17:09:18] AutomatedTester: page objects
[17:09:37] simonstewart: Ahhh... those three points I just raised are my new holy grail
[17:10:10] jimevans: AutomatedTester: we're bringing up the possibility of approaching UI component vendors about providing webdriver-based test libraries for their components
[17:10:11] simonstewart: Not just page objects, but useful integration
[17:10:17] simonstewart: That page objects could be built on
[17:10:31] AutomatedTester: fwiw, we are trying to do this with BrowserID
[17:10:51] AutomatedTester: the new single signon project from Mozilla
[17:11:06] simonstewart: I'm aware of it, but never used it
[17:11:16] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[17:11:33] AutomatedTester: we have a WebDriver project at the moment that you drop the library and you can use webdriver against it
[17:11:43] jimevans: right. time for food. i'm monitoring the latest CI build to see how far away we are from 2.22.

[17:24:37] IvanDM: I just hit a very annoying issue: FF12 and Native Events.
[17:24:45] alairock has joined #selenium
[17:25:03] IvanDM: if you can find a reason for me NOT to switch to disable Native Events, be my guest.
[17:25:21] IvanDM: or I'll assume that Native Events are good only for NOT-LATEST browsers
[17:25:22] IvanDM: :)
[17:25:38] alairock: How can I assert or waitfor a specific value (of ANY element?)
[17:25:51] simonstewart: IvanDM: build from tip of tree
[17:26:14] simonstewart: Technically we support native events for Firefox N and N-1, 10, 3.x
[17:26:16] IvanDM: simonstewart: this makes me think that next Selenium will fix the issue?
[17:26:23] simonstewart: We've been having a fun time shipping 2.22
[17:26:25] Dude-X: 2.22 will have native event support
[17:26:27] simonstewart: Yes
[17:26:32] IvanDM: ok
[17:26:47] IvanDM: simonstewart: but who is going to guarantee that at FF13
[17:26:50] IvanDM: I won't have the same issue?
[17:27:28] Dude-X: don't upgrade?
[17:27:59] IvanDM: Dude-X: ouch! I thought someone might say that! :(
[17:28:19] IvanDM: simonstewart: how long before 2.22 is released than?
[17:28:20] alairock: How can I assert or waitfor a specific value (of ANY element?)
[17:28:29] Dude-X: well, you should have a stable test enviromnet, and not upgrade so often
[17:28:33] Dude-X: i am still on 2.17
[17:29:19] IvanDM: Dude-X: well, we don't use Selenium for internal test - we provide a service based on selenium
[17:29:25] IvanDM: customers ask for latest browsers
[17:29:26] lukeis: IvanDM: i'm fairly certain there will be 2.22 release as soon as all the tests become green in the code base... so it depends :)
[17:30:22] Dude-X: IvanDM: in that case, your customers will understand that they will have to wait
[17:30:36] lukeis: FF N+1 support will come when mozilla supplies the browser driver ;) (which is in the works)
[17:30:41] Dude-X: you maybe able to download the source of selenium and recompile when the latest SDK comes out
[17:30:55] Dude-X: lukeis: really?
[17:31:00] IvanDM: than I go back to my original question: why should I like Native Events?
[17:31:23] IvanDM: ps I know what they are, so I can understand the basic myself - but is there a "larger future picture" for those?
[17:31:38] lukeis: Dude-X: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Marionette
[17:31:50] Dude-X: that's a good question; i use synthetic events because they seem more stable
[17:31:56] Dude-X: buuut i test on firefox 3.6
[17:32:22] simonstewart: IvanDM: you should use them because they're great at emulating user interactiosn
[17:32:30] simonstewart: Most people just take the default settings and are happy
[17:32:37] Dude-X: lukeis: ah yes marionette
[17:33:59] IvanDM: simonstewart: so, what I should do is to move to newer version of browsers only when u guys certify it's going to work
[17:34:16] simonstewart: IvanDM: track whatever you feel most interested in
[17:34:20] simonstewart: We'll continue working
[17:34:58] jimevans: simonstewart: thanks. got the email.
[17:35:42] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: mozilla did a force upgrade of users
[17:35:52] simonstewart: jimevans: no time like the present
[17:35:53] AutomatedTester: from 3.6
[17:36:08] Dude-X: AutomatedTester: does that affect CentOS firefox3.6?
[17:36:18] AutomatedTester: um dunno
[17:36:28] Dude-X: we use the standard anonymous profile of wedriver
[17:36:39] Dude-X: i guess if it was upgraded my full test suite would fail 
[17:38:37] AutomatedTester: Dude-X: why cant you upgrade?
[17:39:02] Dude-X: i have to fix a few tests that involve tinyMCE
[17:39:23] Dude-X: i will standardize on firefox 10 esr

[17:42:17] kallisti: firefox profiles are /finally/ working correctly.
[17:45:46] kallisti: but it seems a little slow. Here's the time/memory usage for zipping and then transferring a test profile http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16495819/2012-05-21_12-37-05_2390x768.png
[17:46:12] iamjarvo: kallisti:  ive been having a problem with server not found. did you have that problem also with your profiles?
[17:46:23] kallisti: no.
[17:46:36] jimevans: i don't say it often enough, so let me publicly thank jleyba for all his continuing hard work on the safari driver. some of the problems he is solving are very important to the IE driver, and i'm incredibly grateful to be able to build on his work.
[17:46:38] kallisti: server not found isn't a profile issue.
[17:47:50] iamjarvo: kallisti:  hrm when i was researching found somethings that said conflicting versions of firefox might cause it.  does selenium have a log or some sort that i can look at to see if the server is actually starting up
[17:48:03] iamjarvo:  i am using the selenium-webdriver gem for ruby
[17:48:29] kallisti: I typically use the standalone server for debugging.
[17:48:37] kallisti: because it provides server-side stack traces.
[17:48:56] Dude-X: jimevans: +1
[17:49:45] iamjarvo: kallisti:  ahh i see. Is there a way for me to check if the server is running
[17:49:52] iamjarvo: if i use the gem
[17:49:59] iamjarvo: like look at alog file or soemthing
[17:50:09] kallisti: not without running the standalone server manually
[17:50:32] kallisti: by default, Ruby launches Firefox with a custom WebDriver extension
[17:50:39] kallisti: which then acts as the server.
[17:51:11] iamjarvo: ahh i see
[17:51:30] kallisti: so maybe if your profile is broken that would cause the server not to run at all.
[17:51:52] iamjarvo: kallisti:  yea maybe. any tips on fixing that
[17:52:05] kallisti: not really. it would depend on what's wrong with the profile.
[17:52:46] iamjarvo: kallisti:  is there specific things taht the profile needs to have or something along the lines
[17:52:57] iamjarvo: because it worked and then randomly stoped
[17:53:27] kallisti: I wouldn't be able to compile a list off-hand.
[17:53:46] dmachi1 has joined #selenium
[17:54:04] kallisti: you could create a new profile in Firefox' profile manager
[17:54:18] kallisti: open firefox with it once so that it initializes the profile directory
[17:54:21] kallisti: and then see what's inside
[17:54:31] andreastt: :note dawagner Got the certificate issue again now.
[17:54:31] selbot2: ok!
[17:55:33] kallisti: iamjarvo: also you could try your code with the blank profile to make sure it's actually an issue with the profile and not something else.
[17:56:18] jimevans: simonstewart: have a question about the logic of the java tests when launching IE
[17:56:32] simonstewart: k
[17:56:35] simonstewart: Fire away
[17:56:56] iamjarvo: kallisti:   so i created a new profile through the profile manager so that should be blank right
[17:56:56] kallisti: wow base64 encoding uses a surprising amount of memory.
[17:57:06] kallisti: iamjarvo: yes but you need to open firefox with it once
[17:57:08] kallisti: to initialize it
[17:57:18] jimevans: i'm a little lost as to which driver supplier is called in which cases. 
[17:57:41] simonstewart: k
[17:57:42] jimevans: there's a line somewhere where the native events capability gets set, and i'm not sure where that happens.
[17:58:21] simonstewart: It'll be under java/client/test/org/openqa/selenium/testing/

[17:59:09] simonstewart: The TestInternetExplorerDriver seems like a good starting point
[17:59:28] iamjarvo: kallisti:  didnt work ={ . In theory I should be able to go to the url while the test is running right?
[17:59:42] iamjarvo: so in another browser i can go to the url and it should work
[IRC logfile - Started Mon May 21 18:00:18 2012]
[18:00:18] kallisti: what.
[18:00:37] kallisti: yes other browsers will continue to work while you're running a test (???)
[18:00:57] iamjarvo: kallisti:  so when the test suite loads up and its trying to go to http://test.127localhost.com:9987/  i can open up chrome and go to that url?
[18:01:41] kallisti: I don't see why not.
[18:02:09] iamjarvo: so that doesnt work for me. so i think that means the selenium server is not starting right
[18:02:10] jimevans: simonstewart: found the problem, i think. in  WebDriverBuilder.java, there's a line that sets the HAS_NATIVE_EVENTS capability if there's a boolean passed in. this now matters for IE.
[18:02:35] kallisti: iamjarvo: oh that's the URL of the selenium server?
[18:02:39] kallisti: I thought it was the website you were testing.
[18:02:45] iamjarvo: yea
[18:03:04] kallisti: iamjarvo: have you tested with no profile at all?
[18:03:17] iamjarvo: kallisti:  how do i do that
[18:03:24] kallisti: by not specifying a profile
[18:03:26] kallisti: a default will be used.
[18:03:39] kallisti: iamjarvo: it sounds to me like you're trying to run tests remotely
[18:03:45] nirvdrum has joined #selenium
[18:03:58] iamjarvo: well with the webdriver i am not specifying a profile

[18:09:05] kallisti: then you have a selenium server running

[18:10:09] iamjarvo: hrm
[18:13:48] kallisti: iamjarvo: the "selenium server" is a program that communicates with your client (aka "your code") and handles the heavy lifting of automating the browser session
[18:14:39] kallisti: it's not the thing you're trying to open in Firefox.

[18:25:42] Dude-X: 4 seconds?

[18:25:57] Dude-X: 12 seconds, maybe
[18:26:06] kallisti: Dude-X: I'm atually not sure what's going on in that pause.
[18:26:57] kallisti: the small chunk of memory is the zip code
[18:27:06] kallisti: the large spike at the end is the base64 encoding
[18:27:12] kallisti: not really sure why there's a period of 0 memory usage inbetween
[18:29:17] kallisti: perhaps it's not 0
[18:29:31] kallisti: and just negligible, and the graph's scale doesn't reflect that.
[18:29:47] Dude-X: perhaps

Can anyone set the record straight? Can I run multiple versions of a browser on the same machine? If so, are there any simple tutorials on this that I missed?
[18:44:05] Dude-X: you need to use remote webdriver, and a test framework that can execute multiple tests in parallel

[18:45:47] RossPatterson: pash1K: Consecutive works fine, as long as the browser will let you install multiple versions.

[20:06:59] santiycr: zzup
[20:07:10] barancev: and we can talk about CI :)
[20:07:17] barancev: it is unstable
[20:07:28] barancev: since the beginning of the May
[20:08:04] barancev: tests are failing on CI, but run green in the local env
[20:08:15] barancev: something happened there
[20:08:32] santiycr: barancev: I'm listening
[20:08:50] barancev: last several days they start to end with Failure due to timeout -- 120 minutes is not enough
[20:09:12] barancev: santiycr: can you look at the server logs to see what's broken?
[20:10:18] barancev: e.g. the last commit
[20:11:55] barancev: I suppose that at some moment our "application under test" aka "debug server" becomes unreachable
[20:12:12] barancev: and tests start to fail all in row
[20:12:55] barancev: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Firefox%2010%20Linux%20Native%20Java%20Tests/721/console -- failed after 120 minutes
[20:13:15] barancev: do we have so many tests? do we need to increase timeout?
[20:13:34] barancev: or change something in the test/env to run faster?
[20:13:52] barancev: and what has been changed in the beginning of the May?
[20:14:46] barancev: see -- http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Firefox%2010%20Linux%20Native%20Java%20Tests/ -- they were all green till the first days of the May
[20:15:00] barancev: and the same for other jobs too
[20:15:44] barancev: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/IE%209%20Java%20Tests/ -- started to fail exactly on 1st of the May

[20:25:04] barancev: santiycr: thanks!
[20:25:15] barancev: we like green so much...
[20:25:26] santiycr: heh
[20:25:40] santiycr: dawagner and I discussed several ways to speed up the tests
[20:25:44] lukeis: yeah, we didn't like blue balls... had to have green ;)
[20:25:50] santiycr: one is increasing the parallelization limit
[20:25:55] santiycr: which I'm working on from the sauce end
[20:26:02] santiycr: it's mainly a political task ;)
[20:26:15] santiycr: the other one, is to have the selenium jar run the debug server inside it
[20:26:34] santiycr: that would let the tests hit the server in localhost, speeding up page loads like crazy
[20:27:20] santiycr: the third idea is a sauce internal task as well, which will be adding a cache for jar files
[20:27:32] santiycr: which means we won't have to download the brand new jar in every single test
[20:27:41] santiycr: through the internet
[20:27:52] santiycr: but only from a caching server in the sauce internal network
[20:28:40] lukeis: nexus or artifactory are decent for that ;)

[20:41:08] jimevans: santiycr: you download the IE standalone server each run, yes?
[20:45:48] santiycr: jimevans: not right now
[20:46:11] santiycr: jimevans: there's no ci to pull it from
[20:46:16] jimevans: ah. so if there are any changes or bug fixes in a given change set, the ci build won't pick them up.
[20:46:22] santiycr: unless that changed
[20:46:40] jimevans: that explains things.
[20:46:48] santiycr: well, I think we need to
[20:47:00] santiycr: it's just that there's nothing setup to build the exe
[20:47:09] santiycr: if there was, sauce could download it every time
[20:47:29] santiycr: and I really don't want to go down the road of building it on the sauce end
[20:47:37] jimevans: no, i wouldn't recommend that.
[20:47:40] santiycr: I think it needs to be under the Selenium project control
[20:47:59] jimevans: how do you get it on the machines now?
[20:50:17] santiycr: jimevans: me?
[20:50:23] jimevans: yeah.
[20:50:35] santiycr:  what do you mean by "get in on the machines"?
[20:51:08] santiycr: the way it works is, we have the specific exe release in S3, our boxes download it on boot
[20:51:10] jimevans: the standalone server. the ci builds use it now, right? if so, how do you get that .exe on the machines?
[20:51:21] santiycr: ^^
[20:51:46] santiycr: we can easily put a new exe by placing it on s3

[21:46:44] jimevans: santiycr: chat in a minute? brb.
[21:46:49] santiycr: sure
[21:47:34] santiycr: barancev: the main cause for such a long build is hard to pin point
[21:48:26] santiycr: there's nothing in particular in the tests that show them spending time unnecessarily 
[21:49:11] santiycr: page loads seem pretty fast
[21:49:13] santiycr: as well
[21:49:40] jleyba has joined #selenium
[21:50:09] santiycr: I think the next thing to do is discuss increasing your parallelization limits
[21:50:17] santiycr: the project is currently running up to 15 in parallel
[21:50:30] santiycr: I want that to eventually reach 50, but we have to take it on stages
[21:51:02] santiycr: while sauce works on expanding our cloud to support our fast growing usage :)
[21:51:55] barancev: santiycr: how about this one: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/IE%206%20Java%20Tests/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.openqa.selenium.interactions.touch/TouchFlickTest/testCanFlickVerticallyFastFromWebElement/
[21:52:13] barancev: it has an error message "Exception creating driver, after Sauce-detected exception"
[21:52:27] barancev: it should be easier to diagnose, no?
[21:55:07] santiycr: barancev: let me give you a tip
[21:55:21] santiycr: the session id that you see in the Standard Error, is also the job id in sauce
[21:55:27] santiycr: bcc20f5dba1b4f55a9121cd298b7b109
[21:55:41] santiycr: which means you can build your own link to see things from the sauce side:
[21:55:46] santiycr: https://saucelabs.com/jobs/bcc20f5dba1b4f55a9121cd298b7b109
[21:56:36] barancev: excellent!
[21:56:42] barancev: thank you!
[21:56:49] santiycr: one day we'll put that link in the logs
[21:56:54] santiycr: so that people just need to click it
[21:57:43] santiycr: barancev: FWIW, from the Sauce end, I don't see much
[21:57:59] jimevans: santiycr: i'm back now.
[21:59:20] jimevans: what can we do to get more recent bits into the IE driver tests?
[21:59:50] santiycr: barancev: it seems like sessions are being reused (single selenium session on the server side, multiple tests on the client)
[21:59:56] jimevans: right now, the exe doesn't rev very often, so i'm not sure it's something that has to happen super often
[IRC logfile - Started Mon May 21 22:00:02 2012]
[22:00:02] santiycr: jimevans: give me a url I can pull the exe from
[22:00:25] santiycr: jimevans: preferably, built by a CI on every commit
[22:00:42] santiycr: we can let the project specify their own url, as we do with the selenium jar to use
[22:00:58] jimevans: sorry. can't give you that. i can give you a URL, but the executable is zipped.
[22:01:00] santiycr: sauce will download it from there, extract and place in the path
[22:01:08] jimevans: wait, never mind
[22:01:10] jimevans: that won't work.
[22:01:23] jimevans: the zip file name is different when i rev the exe.
[22:03:25] santiycr: jimevans: I use the standard format in the google code downloads repo
[22:03:39] santiycr: sauce will download the zip and expect the exe to be in it
[22:03:48] santiycr: then extrac it and place it in the path
[22:03:58] jimevans: so the current path is http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/IEDriverServer_Win32_2.21.2.zip.
[22:04:02] santiycr: so, you can give a url to your own zip, should work just fine
[22:04:06] santiycr: yes
[22:04:11] santiycr: ah, let me check
[22:04:15] jimevans: but what you have is 2.21.1.
[22:04:42] santiycr: the current one is 2.21.1, yes
[22:04:46] barancev: santiycr: can you help me interprete this one: http://sci.illicitonion.com:8080/job/Chrome%20Linux%20Java%20Tests/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.openqa.selenium/PageLoadingTest/testShouldNotHangIfDocumentOpenCallIsNeverFollowedByDocumentCloseCall/
[22:04:57] jimevans: no, i posted a new one today. it's now 2.21.2. :)
[22:05:08] santiycr: jimevans: unless we let you guys give us a url, we have to do some manual steps

[22:06:29] santiycr: jimevans: if you can just be the ones taking care of the url, you'll remove me (the blottle neck) from the flow
[22:06:48] santiycr: I think the way to do this is with a sauce specific desired capability
[22:06:53] santiycr: as we do with the jar 
[22:07:10] santiycr: something like: "iedriver-version": "url/to/zip"
[22:07:44] santiycr: like with the selenium jar, users will be able to provide either an official release "2.21.1" or a full url for us to download
[22:08:00] santiycr: jimevans: would you be able to set that in the selenium codebase?
[22:08:17] jimevans: i'm sure i would, but i wouldn't know where to start.
[22:08:18] santiycr: I can set stuff up on the sauce end for the download to happen
[22:08:30] santiycr: jimevans: dawagner is your guy then
[22:08:55] santiycr: and once you move the iedriver server build to CI, you can have the build set that up dynamically
[22:08:57] jimevans: ayep.

[22:19:26] santiycr: seems like multiple sessions are logged in the same location

[22:20:02] santiycr: then include a link to the job in Sauce as part of the stacktrace
[22:22:30] barancev: of the 10 sessions I've tried 9 contain only quit command

[22:40:42] barancev: the next session is stil broken: ff7e3bab61ae461ea55224a7e1d616da
[22:40:46] santiycr: barancev: no, but it will make your builds faster

[22:40:59] santiycr: so the debug server is either dying

[22:41:17] santiycr: where is that server's log?
[22:41:21] barancev: yes, it's something about the debug server or its availability
[22:41:49] santiycr: we need to add dawagner to this conversation
[22:42:26] santiycr: we had plans to change how this works
[22:42:46] barancev: yes, at this point we can stop
[22:42:50] santiycr: which would help with this problem by completely removing this as a need
[22:43:01] barancev: nothing that can be done at sauce side
[22:43:19] santiycr: well, I'm bumping the parallel limit for the selenium account
[22:43:26] santiycr: hopefully builds will be 2x faster now
[22:43:39] santiycr: (unless we start DOS'ing the debug server
[22:43:41] barancev: and please add session id to the stack trace
[22:43:48] santiycr: then they will be even more flakey :P
[22:44:08] santiycr: barancev: I believe that needs to happen in the selenium codebase
[22:44:19] barancev: ah, ok
[22:44:25] santiycr: barancev: not that I can't do it, but I think dawagner could do it in 30 secs
[22:44:37] santiycr: while it would take me a couple of hours to figure out where to add the code 
[22:46:38] santiycr: :note dawager let's catch up on the situation of the debug server. Summary: 1 - seems like the debug server stops responding temporarily during tests (unfortunate DOS?). 2 - got a confirmation to bump up the parallel limit for selenium-ci to 30 full time!! Now I'm working on 50 :)  3 - we need to start thinking on a strategy for iedriver server being loaded dynamically

[IRC logfile - Started Mon May 21 23:00:08 2012]
[23:00:08] webguynow: b/c of HtmlRunnerTestLoop  not defined 
[23:01:03] webguynow: I've read that the core extension file, also has to be Exactly named  user-extensions.js
[23:01:06] cachedtl: InternetExplorerDriver standalone server help!, only works over localhost ?
[23:01:35] webguynow: I think it does, as I saw a strange error previously -  Selenium not defined 
[23:02:17] webguynow: So regarding the basic structure and use of extensions with Sel.IDE 
[23:03:32] webguynow: Are commands (functions) from the extensions file, supposed to be usable in the IDE | Commands  ?

[23:04:38] webguynow: You've got the large list of Commands pre-loaded but I don't know where those come from, or how you can add to them with extensions 
[23:14:46] webguynow: How do Commands work directly with the javascript in the extensions files ?

[23:21:28] kamoricks: cachedtl: Yes, some browsers require that the site under test be 'localhost'.
[23:25:56] cachedtl: kamoricks: sorry, let me rephrase... it seems that  when starting IEDriverServer.exe --port=5555 --host=127.0.0.1, I can connect locally and get an http response but when using, say --host=192.168.170.242 any connection to that address is dropped shortly after succeeding 
[23:28:00] cachedtl: I notice some acl stuff in server.cc:85:  const char* options[] = { "listening_ports", listening_ports_buffer,
[23:28:00] cachedtl: Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  "access_control_list", "-0.0.0.0/0,+127.0.0.1",
[23:32:57] kamoricks: cachedtl: Are you building from source or using .NET bindings?
[23:33:45] kamoricks: Looks like source.
[23:35:56] kamoricks: cachedtl: Does connecting to host 0.0.0.0 fix the issue? I've had similar issues with the standalone jar.
[23:37:37] cachedtl: kamoricks: just using the latest standalone binary from http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/detail?name=IEDriverServer_Win32_2.21.2.zip&can=2&q=
[23:38:09] cachedtl: kamoricks: I can only get it to work if i listen on 127.0.0.1
[23:38:31] kamoricks: cachedtl: Odd. 0.0.0.0 should listen on all network interfaces.
[23:41:55] cachedtl: kamoricks: yes i can listen on 0.0.0.0 and it will accept a connection on 192.168.170.242 then (as it does if I listen to that address as well with --host=192.168.170.242) how when connecting (test with telnet 192.168.170.242 5555) there is not output and the connection is dropped, yet telnet to 127.0.0.1 5555 and http works
[23:43:15] kamoricks: Just dropped? No I2P proxy complaining about invalid request type? I seem to have solved a different issue, then... I've no clue what to do with that.
[23:44:23] cachedtl: kamoricks: yep just dropped
