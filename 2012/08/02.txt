[12:08:53] Krishnan: Unfortunately I cant get the IEDriverSErver.exe to dum its logs in my text file.
[12:09:03] Krishnan: Was wondering if someone can please help me with it..
[12:09:27] brettporter has joined #selenium
[12:09:50] barancev: Krishnan: --log-level and --log-file are options of the IEDriverServer.exe, not the Grid
[12:10:24] barancev: Grid (at the moment) can't run IEDriverServer.exe with increased logging
[12:10:44] Krishnan: Barancev : Ah ! ok :(
[12:11:29] barancev: if you want to get log from IEDriverServer.exe you have to use local InternetExplorerDriver
[12:11:37] Krishnan: So if I were to be suspecting that a IE based test crashes the IEDriverServer.exe there is no way of providing that info is it..
[12:11:47] barancev: or start IEDriverServer.exe amnually and connect to it using RemoteWebDriver
[12:11:59] barancev: without Grid
[12:12:36] barancev: I bet all IEDriverServer.exe crashes are not related to Grid specific
[12:12:57] Krishnan: Hmm.. here's why I was looking for this. In Selenium 2.21.0 when involving IE runs, when the Grid's node ends up trying to recycle a IE browser (which currently has an unprocessed alert sitting there) the JVM crashes
[12:12:58] barancev: and you can reproduce a crash without Grid
[12:13:38] barancev: Grid uses the same quit() command to stop the browser
[12:13:49] Krishnan: I bumped up my selenium usage from 2.21 to 2.25 which now forces me to use the IEDriverServer.exe. The JVM no longer crashes.. but I would like to figure out if I can get anything additional.
[12:14:10] Krishnan: Yeah, I get that.. but the quit() would technically be trying to operate on a Terminated Session and that is where the JVM would crash
[12:14:48] Krishnan: This has been happening quite a lot in my org's grid (we run on 2.21.0) and as part of nailing the problem I zero'ed into this.. I kinda found a hacky way wherein I would use my own Proxy and work with it..
[12:15:19] Krishnan: But wanted to figure out if its worth being plugged into DefaultProxy itself, rather than me having it in my own proxy.. coz I suspect that there could be other selenium users who may be going through the same error.
[12:15:33] Krishnan: That was the reason why I wanted to turn on logging for IEDriverServer.exe
[12:15:59] Krishnan: to see if I could get any additonal info, which I could present in a "possible" bug report.
[12:16:28] barancev: logging settings are currently under active developemtn, I hope in one-two versions we will be able to run IE with increased logging in Grid env
[12:16:58] Krishnan: oh ok.. In the meantime, let me see if I can work with InternetExplorerDriver instead and get some additional info
[12:17:56] barancev: yes, it would be better to reproduce an issue without Grid
[12:18:34] Krishnan: cool.. let me see if I can get that done.. Thanks for helping me out barancev ! Appreciate your time

[12:45:49] d0x: barancev: do you have another idea selecting all elements having some text?
[12:47:04] barancev: other than traversing DOM using JS and checking all nodes for presence of text children -- no
[12:47:15] barancev: what do you need this for?
[12:47:29] d0x: I have this http://pastebin.com/zih8SS0M small javascript method that give me the text without the text of its childs
[12:48:09] barancev: that's very close to what I mean, now you have to traverse the tree, and check all the nodes
[12:48:56] d0x: barancev: I like to check some Keywords one a webpage. But this Keywords should not be surrounded by an <a/>
[12:50:27] barancev: do you know what other tags surround this keyword?
[12:53:06] barancev: for example, if you want to separate <div>keyword</div> from <div><a>keyword</a></div> you can find all such divs and filter out those ones that contain <a>
[IRC logfile - Started Thu Aug  2 13:06:31 2012]
[13:06:31] d0x: barancev: in our example i don't like to select the <div><a/>
[13:06:40] d0x: Because the div is empty
[13:06:44] d0x: and the a should be ignored
[13:06:48] d0x: and the other way
[13:07:00] d0x: <a><span>ignored<span></a>
[13:07:03] d0x: should be also ignored
[13:07:56] d0x: with this i can select all elements without a tags //html/body//*[not(ancestor-or-self::a)]

[14:22:10] davehunt: not really, except that if you have syntax or import issues then they may be hidden with using xdist

[14:22:21] davehunt: so you can get a failed testrun with very little details

[20:00:31] emaugust: I am very new to selenium in java (used IDE quite a bit)
[20:00:49] emaugust: how do people decide whether to use JUnit or TestNG for their framework?
[20:00:56] Dude-X: i flipped a coin.
[20:01:06] emaugust: heh, what did you end up choosing?
[20:01:07] Dude-X: but in all seriousness, it has to do with familiarity
[20:01:18] Dude-X: junit is far more popular, so this project i am on uses it
[20:01:19] emaugust: if you had a chance to get in on the ground floor
[20:01:22] Dude-X: so i am stuck with it
[20:01:25] emaugust: ah
[20:01:29] Dude-X: a coworker of mine starting fresh used testNG
[20:01:35] Dude-X: he's able to run 15 firefox instances at once
[20:01:58] emaugust: 15 firefox instances has nothing to do with junit or testng does it?
[20:02:03] emaugust: couldnt you just make 15 drivers?
[20:02:16] Dude-X: it does in terms of executing 15 tests at once
[20:02:30] nacho has joined #selenium
[20:02:44] emaugust: being able to run tests in parallel would certainly speed things up
[20:02:59] Dude-X: it's less clear how to do that with junit
[20:03:03] emaugust: i use automation for website testing... a large portion of my tests is just making sure pages load and links work
[20:03:13] emaugust: so in IDE it would take an hour to go through a pretty small site
[20:03:24] emaugust: but I guess with 15 instances it would be much quicker
[20:03:51] Dude-X: that's if the application can handle 15 different users 
[20:04:07] emaugust: its just a public facing website with no login functionality
[20:04:17] Dude-X: oh
[20:04:20] barancev: use a coin too
[20:04:47] emaugust: I work for a marketing agency so the sites we build are often times B2C
[20:04:49] DaveIngram: adamgoucher: OK, I didn't get it working with the Keys class, but I found that $element->sendKeys("\n"); works just fine
[20:04:51] emaugust: brochure oriented stuf
[20:08:36] emaugust: well, I guess I will learn testNG
[20:08:50] emaugust: since the only positive thing I ever see about jUnit is that it is more entrenched
[20:15:13] barancev: htmlunit recently released 2.10, is it worth to update deps?
