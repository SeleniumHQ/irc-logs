[02:48:11] Dude-X_: goddard, i'm looking
[02:49:09] Dude-X_: your xpath is correct
[02:49:16] Dude-X_: the problem is some other javascript is interfering
[02:49:33] Dude-X_: like jQuery, or Dojo, or some other thing is getting in the way

[03:01:04] klrmn: so, i just updated my IEDriver
[03:01:16] klrmn: because i knew that would be the first thing ya'all would tell me to do
[03:01:42] klrmn: because selenium doesn't seem to be able to open IE8 with a clean profile for me
[03:04:02] goddard: Dude-X_: no way around it?
[03:06:39] Dude-X_: goddard, there is but you have to tell me what does the app use to render that input
[03:07:25] Dude-X_: klrmn, is it possible to open IE8 with a "clean" profile?
[03:08:48] klrmn: Dude-X_: i haven't done a great deal of testing with IE8, but this is the first time i've run into the problem
[03:10:09] klrmn: Dude-X_: what i am saying is that a test's browser remembers things from previous test runs
[03:10:37] klrmn: Dude-X: is this known normal behavior? (this may be a combination of cookies and local storage, not sure)
[03:10:44] goddard: Dude-X_: i have no idea
[03:10:46] Dude-X_: yes, IE8 just sucks
[03:10:56] Dude-X_: you can clear cookies though
[03:11:00] Dude-X_: with webdriver
[03:11:04] klrmn: *nod*
[03:14:36] iwoj has joined #selenium
[03:14:51] klrmn: Dude-X_: apparently, even running these two lines on the browser before the first get doesn't help

[03:14:53] klrmn:     mozwebqa.selenium.execute_script('localStorage.clear()')
[03:15:06] Dude-X_: the last one is for html5 app
[03:15:15] Dude-X_: is your app is an html5 app?
[03:15:17] Dude-X_: on IE?
[03:15:18] klrmn: the last one the developers say they are using
[03:15:19] *Dude-X_ snickeres
[03:15:41] klrmn: never said their browser support made sense =)
[03:16:27] Dude-X_: why are you using mozilla's api?
[03:16:39] Dude-X_: nothing wrong with it, but you have to be familiar with everything that they do
[03:17:39] klrmn: because the work i'm doing is for mozilla =)
[03:17:53] Dude-X_: oh
[03:17:55] Dude-X_: :D
[03:18:00] klrmn: having become familiar with it, i've used it on other projects as well
[03:18:19] Dude-X_: i wonder if i leave my current job would i take my browser wrapper
[03:18:33] Dude-X_: well i'd definitely use python thats for sure, not java
[03:19:29] klrmn: i've definitely been enjoying python more than when i was trying to do it with java
[03:20:09] klrmn: can i quote you on expecting IE8 to do HTML5 being crazy-talk?
[03:20:31] goddard: Dude-X_: this is the javascript file http://jsfiddle.net/gpnz8/

[03:24:18] goddard: yeah now you know my issue.. I am pretty much done with this project but this one thing is given me trouble
[03:24:28] Dude-X_: is it mootools?
[03:25:07] Dude-X_: you don't know what popular javascript library it uses? Dojo, YUI, MooTools, jQuery, Prototype
[03:25:17] Dude-X_: goddard, well the alternative then
[03:25:26] Dude-X_: is to use Firefox with Firebug with FireDiff
[03:25:34] Dude-X_: and see what changes to the DOM are happening
[03:25:45] Dude-X_: wait for the last element to disappear or appear
[03:25:50] Dude-X_: then you can find that input
[03:26:05] Dude-X_: if you know the javascript library, then you can do clever things too
[03:26:13] iwoj has left #selenium
[03:31:51] Dude-X_: my app uses jQuery, so I might things like driver.execute_script("return $j('jQuerySelector').filter('animated') === 0") in a timing out loop
[03:42:29] stephend has joined #selenium
[03:52:51] klrmn: ps Dude-X_: the workaround for IE8 is to use sauce labs‚Ä¶they spin up not just a fresh browser but a fresh OS
[03:55:32] Dude-X_: yeah they have vm's 
[03:55:34] Dude-X_: but that's slow
[03:55:52] klrmn: slow is better than crashing / failing

[08:54:54] barancev: if some browsers fail, you can add a guard, let me find an example for you
[08:57:31] martisj: do you guys use the IDE to start off your tests or go straight to client api?
[08:57:52] andreastt: Where I work we don't use IDE at all.
[08:58:25] martisj: yeah coz I'm trying to send keys to the browser, but i can't do Keys.UPARROW in IDE
[08:58:29] martisj: any ideas/
[08:59:16] andreastt: I think I'd personally find it more cumbersome to use IDE than to write them using WebDriver directly.
[08:59:43] andreastt: We write TCs for browsers, so not so much for web apps.  If I was writing for a web app however, I'd probably use some page object pattern.

[09:10:49] martisj: source column too long.
[09:10:51] barancev: andreastt: shown_test.html, method testIsShownTakesIntoAccountParentVisibility or text_box_test.html, method testRunIn_followedByBlock

[09:41:44] davehunt has joined #selenium
[09:48:29] rp2: well I wanted to know if it was considered on-topic
[09:49:14] rp2: the question is this: Selenium recorders derive XPath expressions for a specific element on the page.
[09:49:25] benadderson has joined #selenium
[09:49:37] rp2: does the WebDriver API support this as well?
[09:50:17] brettporter has joined #selenium
[09:50:20] rp2: e.g. a WebElement.getXPathTo() method would be nice - but how hard is it to write one?
[09:51:55] rp2: of course I can write my own: take the element's tag name and parent, in the parent find all of its children with that tag name, apply this recursively. but it's rather expensive
[09:53:35] rp2: has somebody done this, or something similar, for me already?
[09:54:17] rp2: the reason I need this right now is better debug messages.
[09:54:46] zac_sel: I imagine the devs would say that's outside the scope of webdriver api because it's not a browser action itself
[09:55:06] rp2: e.g. when I get an exception: you can't click this element because it isn't visible, I'd like to see an XPath to that element
[09:55:31] zac_sel: you know how you located that element already don't you?
[09:55:38] rp2: zac_sel: but they do provide getText()
[09:55:44] rp2: no, I don't.
[09:56:00] zac_sel: yeah getText is the equivalent of me using my eyes :)
[09:56:04] rp2: well I suppose I could track it, I did select it somehow
[09:57:38] zac_sel: hmm, I did think of this once before but it was for a different purpose: I was thinking it would be nice to get the selector I used to select it back from the webelement in order to make it easier to daisy chain findBy mtehods. 
[09:57:46] zac_sel: but never have felt I'd need it for debugging
[09:57:56] rp2: what I'm doing right now is for (WebElement a: wd.findElements(By.xpath("//a[href]") { try { a.click() } catch (NotVisibleException e) { ->>> this is where I want to use a.getXpathTo() <<<- }
[09:58:11] rp2: }
[09:58:39] rp2: so I select a bunch of elements and I want a path to a specific member
[09:59:13] zac_sel: are you sure you can't write a more accurate Xpath in the first place?
[09:59:40] jibay has joined #selenium
[09:59:41] Nari has joined #selenium
[09:59:45] rp2: not always. e.g. in this case I just wnat to check whether the page has unclickable links

[10:01:14] rp2: (of course I can hardcode more information about what's on the page right now, making my test more brittle than it needs to be)
[10:01:58] zac_sel: and you can' tuse getText() where you want to use getXpathTo()

[10:38:26] nullx: there is no headless version of selenium yet, right?
[10:38:41] andreastt: nullx: Define headless, please.
[10:38:47] nullx: Doesn't open a browser.
[10:38:49] nullx: er
[10:38:57] nullx: Doesn't open a brwoser, and has dynamic javascript support
[10:39:00] andreastt: Well, you'll need a browser, obviously.
[10:39:18] andreastt: There is HtmlUnitDriver and the new GhostDriver thing.
[10:39:23] nullx: GhostDriver?
[10:39:29] nullx: googling
[10:39:39] andreastt: Based on PhantomJS.
[10:39:41] davehunt has joined #selenium
[10:39:48] nullx: cool
[10:39:48] AutomatedTester: there is headless versions of Selenium
[10:39:57] nullx: AutomatedTester - does javascript work though?
[10:40:05] andreastt: Typically you really do want to use a proper browser, though.
[10:40:09] AutomatedTester: and you can use real browsers with xvfb to create the illusion of headless
[10:40:23] andreastt: If you're using a sensible operating system, you can put it into a virtual framebuffer, like xvfb.
[10:40:24] nullx: AutomatedTester - yeah, but it won't ever be as fast as something that never visualizes anything
[10:40:42] AutomatedTester: nullx: you know that phantom and htmlunit still have to do a render
[10:40:43] andreastt: nullx: But don't you want the browser to behave as it normally would?
[10:40:49] AutomatedTester: just it doesnt go to the screen
[10:40:51] nullx: AutomatedTester - they do? no shit
[10:40:56] nullx: wow
[10:40:59] andreastt: If you cut the rendering part out of the equation, the browser won't behave as it normally would.
[10:41:03] nullx: then I should just use selenium
[10:41:04] nullx: okay
[10:41:25] nullx: thank god in a way, I love ruby for ruby on rails, but not for deep coding projects
[10:41:59] AutomatedTester: nullx: the difference in speed between headless browsers and real browsers is so minute that in my opinion isnt always worth it
[10:42:11] nullx: you've tested this?
[10:42:14] AutomatedTester: yes
[10:42:24] nullx: in that case... dedicated browser on a dedicated machine it is
[10:42:37] AutomatedTester: browser start up times are shrinking all the time that it is getting closer
[10:42:48] nullx: AutomatedTester - second question, have you used selenium in C#? Is there any language it's best in?
[10:42:51] andreastt: We have headless internal builds of Opera too, which are pretty much exactly running at the same speeds as the ones with rendering.
[10:42:57] AutomatedTester: plus how many of your users use a headless browser?
[10:43:02] nullx: AutomatedTester - true
[10:43:13] andreastt: AutomatedTester's last point is fairly crucial I'd say.
[10:43:14] nullx: no, I can't argue with you for the most part..  
[10:43:27] AutomatedTester: nullx: python, ruby, .net and java all have the same ability
[10:43:29] nullx: I don't test visual elements with selenium, I query the source, because testing visual elements takes too long
[10:43:30] nullx: okay
[10:43:36] nullx: I'm gonna go for .NET then, I suppose.
[10:43:37] *AutomatedTester has worked on .net and python personally
[10:43:37] andreastt: Yay!  SVN finished checking out.
[10:44:00] nullx: I've done a lot of python and ruby recently, but I love working in C#
[10:44:13] AutomatedTester: i <3 c# too
[10:44:19] *AutomatedTester doesnt use it enough :/
[10:44:25] nullx: yeah
[10:44:34] nullx: it's so easy to read, easy to organize, easy to import other .net stuff
[10:44:41] nullx: I dunno what I love about it, but it's my favorite atm
[10:44:57] nullx: not for web, but for programmatical heh
[10:45:16] AutomatedTester: nullx: my employer doesnt use .NET for anything so concentrate on python
[10:45:25] nullx: yeah I hear that
[10:45:42] nullx: I have been in that boat, I wrote an entire testing framework under PHP of all languages
[10:45:45] AutomatedTester: my last employer used .NET all the time
[10:46:00] AutomatedTester: nullx: wow... someone hated you a lot to make you write PHP
[10:46:04] nullx: lol no
[10:46:06] andreastt: We don't use .NET either.  Actually, we don't use anything Microsoft at all.
[10:46:07] nullx: it was a php house =/
[10:46:10] andreastt: Well, apart from the compiler.
[10:46:19] nullx: I'm gonna use mono C#, rather than ms .net
[10:46:28] nullx: so it won't be MS heh
[10:46:43] andreastt: C# seems rather nice.  But I'm worried about subsea patents.
[10:47:00] nullx: yeah one day come out of the waterworks and suddenly they can kill mono
[10:47:03] nullx: that's kind of true
[10:47:15] nullx: If it were only easy to make a programming platform as nice as .NET =)
[10:47:25] nullx: they actually did something great there IMO
[10:47:51] andreastt: Since we're already entering a language debate, I'm quite fond of Go.
[10:47:56] nullx: never played with that
[10:48:04] andreastt: But still, never had anything to use it for.
[10:48:08] nullx: I hate that =)
[10:48:14] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I have never used it
[10:48:27] AutomatedTester: andreastt: I hear that it forces you to think about data flow more 
[10:48:31] andreastt: With C++0x, C++ is getting not-very-painful too.
[10:48:40] andreastt: AutomatedTester: I've only dabbled (-:
[10:48:59] *AutomatedTester is proud to say that he has never used C++ in any form
[10:49:01] nullx: I think it was SCTP I loved but have never been able to use
[10:49:23] nullx: It's way better than TCP and UDP, it's very powerful
[10:49:39] andreastt: I really need to improve my JS skills though.
[10:49:54] nullx: I tried working with PhantomJS for a while, wanted to shoot myself
[10:50:01] andreastt: Really, how so?

[10:54:22] barancev: or use goog.dom.selection.setCursorPosition

[11:26:05] barancev: freynaud: hi! I was experimenting with capabilities matching in grid, and I've found that when I run a node with parameter -browser "browserName=firefox14,version=14,platform=XP" and then when I create a session with a DesiredCapability object that has browserName = "firefox14", the node does not reject this request, but it tries to start IE!
[11:26:29] freynaud: barancev: makes no sense to me 
[11:26:57] freynaud: barancev: it  does
[11:27:02] freynaud: it's the node config
[11:27:20] freynaud: if grid is told there is a browser ABC on node X
[11:27:31] freynaud: it will forward a request for ABC to X
[11:27:49] freynaud: if it's not on X, the normal wbdriver of best match browser is triggered
[11:28:34] barancev: you told Grid treats all the capabilities as 'required', strict checking, no?
[11:29:08] barancev: it can't start any browser with this paramenters (what should it start?)

[11:29:18] barancev: so it should reject the request, no?
[11:29:43] freynaud: yes, it you have throwOnCapabilityNotPResent = yes
[11:29:52] freynaud: otherwise, it keeps the request in the queue
[11:30:02] freynaud: hoping that the capability will become present later on
[11:31:17] barancev: keeps the request in the queue? no! it tries to start IE
[11:32:07] freynaud: un a node with parameter -browser "browserName=firefox14
[11:32:15] barancev: exactly
[11:32:17] freynaud: you described the node as firefox14
[11:32:22] barancev: yes
[11:32:33] freynaud: the hub doesn't validate the description
[11:32:40] barancev: ok
[11:32:48] freynaud: if you say firefox version 40 000
[11:33:05] freynaud: the hub will assume that's true, and forward to the node a firefox 40000 request
[11:33:23] barancev: no problem with the hub, why the node does not reject it?
[11:33:29] freynaud: once the node is reached, it's the best match algorithm from plain web driver, so IE will pop
[11:33:33] freynaud: no
[11:34:30] barancev: strange logic, imho. I no mean wanted IE :)
[11:34:45] freynaud: i always confused me to
[11:35:04] freynaud: if I ask for FF, giving me IE is worst than crashing
[11:35:09] freynaud: it gives false positive

[18:06:25] eanxgeek: so related to the same code from earlier, only now apparently working - sort of.  https://gist.github.com/3361694 passing org ACME_Corporation works, passing org Test fails with Exception: Organization not found: Test
[18:06:56] stackedsax has joined #selenium
[18:06:57] eanxgeek: anyone see anything obvious that I missed in setting this up, you can see from my firebug tests that I can return the elements for ACME_Corporation and Test
[18:07:13] dawagner: :note AutomatedTester I may be around your parts next week!

[18:20:50] barancev: dawagner: hi! what's status of FF10 on CI?
[18:21:10] llaskin: :ci status
[18:21:11] selbot2: 0 building | 16 successful | 17 unstable | 0 failing | 2 aborted
[18:21:19] andreastt: Arrg.
[18:21:37] andreastt: Damn me for applying garbage collection too soon to something I'm working on.
[18:21:57] dawagner: barancev: Currently broken, blocked on investigation which requires server logs which santiycr is getting us access too
[18:22:00] dawagner: santiycr: How's that going?
[18:22:03] andreastt: Spent 30 mins trying to figure out why my ThreadLocal isn't working.  It turns out it's being GC'ed on every page load.
[18:22:40] santiycr: Hi

[18:23:14] santiycr: currently working on making our requeing logic cleaner
[18:23:26] jimevans has joined #selenium
[18:23:26] santiycr: so that logs don't get lost for the last time we requeue
[18:23:27] barancev: santiycr: all out hope on you :)
[18:23:37] barancev: s/out/our/
[18:23:41] santiycr: :)
[18:23:48] mdgreenfield has joined #selenium
[18:23:54] santiycr: do you guys want me to get you some logs by hand in the meantime?
[18:24:08] dawagner: Do you have an ETA on being able to get them automatically?
[18:24:10] santiycr: don't want to keep you stuck if it takes me 5' to unstuck you
[18:24:19] mdgreenfield has left #selenium
[18:24:20] santiycr: 1 to 2 days
[18:24:29] dawagner: Probably easiest just to wait :)
[18:24:36] santiycr: depending on the amount of random tasks that come up in my day :)
[18:24:42] dawagner: Can you let emmasoderberg know when it's done? :)
[18:24:54] santiycr: for example, Win7 in our cloud requesting for activation for the 10th time
[18:25:03] santiycr: dawagner:  sounds good
[18:25:13] santiycr: will leave notes for everyone if I'm not around
[18:25:21] santiycr: s/I'm/you're/
[18:26:21] dawagner: That's nice of it!
[18:26:22] dawagner: Thanks :)
[18:27:41] santiycr: you're welcome 
[18:27:48] santiycr: sorry for the pain
[18:35:44] eanxgeek: to further expand on my above question, I have added another org to my list, and again my ccs_selector finds all three orgs I now have, but when run only the first org (ACME_Corporation) works.
